Abstract
Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity is a concept rooted in psychology and phenomenology, offering significant
insights into human decision-making and well-being. Similarly, in social analysis and social sciences, frame-
works such as PDCA, DMAIC, SWOT, and OODA have been established to enable structured evaluation and
effective problem-solving. Furthermore, in phenomenology and social sciences, various logical systems have
been developed to address specific objectives and practical applications.
This paper extends these concepts using the Neutrosophic theory, revisiting their mathematical definitions and
exploring their properties. The Neutrosophic Set, an extension of the Fuzzy Set, is a highly flexible framework
that has been widely studied in fields such as social sciences. By incorporating Neutrosophic Sets, we aim to
improve their suitability for programming and mathematical analysis, providing advanced methods to tackle
complex, multi-dimensional problems.
We hope that this research will inspire further studies and foster the development of practical applications across
various related disciplines.

1 Short Introduction
1.1 Phenomenology: Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity
Phenomenology is a philosophical approach that investigates conscious experiences as they are perceived, fo-
cusing on intentionality, subjective interpretation, and the suspension of preconceived notions to reveal the
essence of phenomena and lived experiences [110, 139, 244, 345, 398, 411]. Its relevance spans disciplines
such as psychology, sociology [87, 107], education [98], and healthcare [297], highlighting the importance of
continued research in phenomenological studies.
Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity is a concept originating from psychology and phenomenology (cf. [105, 112,
183, 195, 360]). It reflects the interconnected dimensions of human existence: the physical body, mental pro-
cesses, emotional soul, and spiritual awareness. Recently, this concept has been extended through the frame-
work of Neutrosophic Sets, giving rise to Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity, a more flexible and
robust model for understanding the dynamics of these interconnected dimensions [337].
1.2 Social Analysis: PDCA, DMAIC, SWOT, OODA, and Five Forces Analysis
Social Science studies human behavior, societies, and cultures using systematic research and interdisciplinary
approaches [142,393]. Social Analysis examines societal structures, relationships, and processes to understand
social dynamics and address challenges [34, 138]. In the field of Social Analysis and Social Sciences, various
frameworks have been established to facilitate structured evaluation and problem-solving [138]. Notable ex-
amples include the following frameworks, which are widely recognized for their practical applications. In this
paper, these concepts will be extended using the Neutrosophic Set framework discussed later.
• PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act): A cyclical framework designed for continuous improvement. It involves
planning strategies, executing actions, evaluating results, and refining processes to achieve better out-
comes [133, 173, 256, 291].
• DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control): A methodology derived from Six Sigma that em-
phasizes defining problems, collecting and measuring data, analyzing root causes, implementing im-
provements, and controlling processes to maintain quality [224, 242, 285, 286, 300, 356].
• SWOT (Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats): A strategic planning tool used to assess internal
strengths and weaknesses, as well as external opportunities and threats, for effective organizational anal-
ysis [93, 140, 237, 305, 311, 391].
• OODA (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act): A decision-making process that focuses on observing situations,
orienting oneself to the context, making informed decisions, and acting promptly, particularly in dynamic
or competitive environments [131, 198, 236, 282, 298, 415].
• Porter’s Five Forces Analysis: A framework for analyzing industry competition. It examines five key
forces: industry rivalry, buyer power, supplier power, the threat of substitutes, and the threat of new
entrants [94, 150, 278].
1.3 Neutrosophic Set and Related Set Theories
Psychology, Phenomenology, and Social Analysis are inherently intertwined with uncertainty. The Neutro-
sophic Set provides a comprehensive framework for effectively addressing and managing these uncertainties.
This subsection explains the Neutrosophic Set and its related concepts.
Set theory is a foundational branch of mathematics that focuses on the study of ”sets,” which are collections of
objects [90, 180, 382, 385]. Over time, extensions of classical set theory have been developed to better handle
the complexities and uncertainties encountered in real-world scenarios. These include Fuzzy Sets [88,358,403,
405–408,417], Vague Sets [9,58,63,165,412], Soft Sets [14,15,120,222,241,400], Hypersoft Sets [332,333],
Rough Sets [266–272], Hyperfuzzy Sets [119,136,182,349], and Neutrosophic Sets [11,54,100,115,251,319,
320, 323, 324, 340, 390].
Each of these frameworks addresses specific forms of ambiguity or uncertainty. For example, Fuzzy Sets as-
sign to each element a membership degree within the interval
[0 1]
, representing partial rather than binary
membership [403]. Neutrosophic Sets extend this concept by assigning three independent degrees—truth, in-
determinacy, and falsity—to each element, making them particularly suitable for managing complex uncertain-
ties [319, 320].
1.4 Our Contribution in This Paper
In this paper, we extend the concepts of Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity, PDCA, DMAIC, SWOT, OODA, and
Five Forces Analysis within the framework of Neutrosophic theory and provide a brief exploration of their
properties. Furthermore, we investigate various types of logic in the contexts of Neutrosophic Phenomenology
and Neutrosophic Social Science. It is important to note that the term ”logic” here refers specifically to non-
classical logic. While some of these concepts are already established, we revisit their mathematical definitions
to facilitate programming and mathematical analysis using Neutrosophic Sets.
We hope that this research will inspire further studies and encourage the development of practical applications
in this emerging field.

2 Preliminaries and Definitions
This section introduces essential concepts from set theory that are used throughout this work. For a deeper
exploration of these concepts and their applications, readers are encouraged to consult the cited references as
necessary [113,159,167,180,207]. Detailed discussions on related operations and extensions are also available
in the listed references.
2.1 Core Concepts in Set Theory
The following are foundational principles in set theory. For additional insights and examples, readers may refer
to the recommended references [180].
Definition 2.1 (Set). [180] A set is defined as a well-determined collection of distinct elements. These elements
𝐴 𝑥
are either included in or excluded from the set. If is a set and is one of its elements, this is expressed as
𝑥 𝐴 𝐴 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐
∈ = { }
. Sets are typically denoted using curly braces, e.g., .
𝐴 𝐵 𝐴 𝐵
Definition 2.2 (Subset). [180] A set is said to be a subset of another set , written , if all elements of
𝐴 𝐵
are also elements of . Formally, this is expressed as:
𝐴 𝐵 𝑥 𝑥 𝐴 𝑥 𝐵 .
⊆ ⇐⇒ ∀ ( ∈ =⇒ ∈ )
We also use the following concepts.
Definition 2.3. (cf. [168]) The set of real numbers includes all rational and irrational numbers. Formally, it
is defined as a complete, ordered field that satisfies the completeness property:
R R.
Every non-empty subset of that is bounded above has a least upper bound in
Definition 2.4. (cf. [194]) The set of integers consists of all whole numbers, including positive, negative,
and zero:
Z . . . , , , , , , . . . .
= { −2 −1 0 1 2 }
2.2 Fuzzy Sets and Neutrosophic Sets
Fuzzy Sets and Neutrosophic Sets are often introduced in relation to their foundational counterpart, the Crisp
Set. Below are formal definitions to establish this context.
Definition 2.5 (Universe Set). (cf. [252]) A universe set, denoted as , is the complete set of all elements
relevant to a particular discussion or problem. It serves as the universal context, encompassing every element
𝐴 𝐴 𝑈
that could be considered within a given framework. For any subset , the relationship holds, meaning
𝐴 𝑈
all elements of must belong to .
The universe set is foundational in set theory, acting as the domain of discourse within which all subsets are
defined. It is synonymous with concepts such as the underlying set or total set.
𝑋 𝑃 𝑋 𝑋
( )
Definition 2.6 (Crisp Set). [259] Let be a universe set, and let represent the power set of , which
𝑋 𝐴 𝑋 𝜒 𝑋 ,
includes all subsets of . A crisp set ⊆ is defined by its characteristic function : → {0 1} , where:
(cid:40)
𝑥 𝐴,
1 if ∈
𝜒 𝑥
( ) =
𝑥 𝐴.
0 if ∉
𝜒 𝐴
The characteristic function assigns a value of 1 to elements belonging to and 0 to those outside it, creating
a clear and definitive boundary. Crisp sets adhere strictly to binary logic, distinguishing whether an element is
inside or outside the set.
A Fuzzy Set assigns each element a degree of membership between 0 and 1, representing partial truth and
handling uncertainty.
𝜏 𝑌 𝜏 𝑌 ,
Definition 2.7 (Fuzzy Set). [403–408] A fuzzy set in a non-empty universe is a function : → [0 1] ,
𝑦 𝑌 ,
where each element
is assigned a degree of membership in the interval
[0 1]
𝛿 𝑌 𝑌 𝜏 𝑌 𝛿 𝑌 𝛿
A fuzzy relation is a fuzzy subset of . If is a fuzzy set in and is a fuzzy relation on , is called a
fuzzy relation on if:
𝛿 𝑦, 𝑧 𝜏 𝑦 , 𝜏 𝑧 𝑦, 𝑧 𝑌 .
( ) ≤ min{ ( ) ( )}
for all
Example 2.8 (Temperature Perception). (cf. [64]) Consider the fuzzy set of ‘‘warm temperatures” in a uni-
𝑌 R 𝜏
verse (all temperatures in Celsius). The membership function could be defined as:
, 𝑦
 0 if ≤ 15 (cold);
 𝑦
𝜏 𝑦 −15 , < 𝑦 <
( ) = if 15 25;
 , 𝑦 .
 1 if ≥ 25 (warm)
𝑦 ◦𝐶 .
For example, at = 20 , the membership degree of ‘‘warm” is 0 5.
Example 2.9 (Tall People). (cf. [196]) In a population where height is measured, the fuzzy set of ‘‘tall people”
can assign membership values based on height :
, ℎ
 0 if ≤ 150 cm (not tall);

) =
ℎ −150 ,
if 150
< ℎ <
180;
 , ℎ .
 1 if ≥ 180 cm (tall)
Here, a person of height 165 cm has a membership degree of 0 5.
Example 2.10 (Risk Level in Investments). (cf. [158]) The fuzzy set of ‘‘high-risk investments” in a universe
of possible investments may assign degrees of risk based on volatility or expected return. For example:
, 𝑟
 0 if volatility ≤ 5%;

) =
𝑟 −5 ,
if 5%
< 𝑟 <
15%;
 , 𝑟 .
 1 if ≥ 15%
𝑟 .
An investment with volatility = 10% would have a membership degree of 0 5 in the ‘‘high-risk” category.
Neutrosophic Set extends Fuzzy Set by introducing truth, indeterminacy, and falsity, each independently in
[0 1]
, handling uncertainty and contradictions more comprehensively [319]. Unlike Fuzzy Sets, Neutrosophic
Sets model indeterminacy explicitly, enabling greater flexibility for uncertain, inconsistent, or ambiguous data
representation.
Definition 2.11 (Neutrosophic Set). [319, 321, 322, 339, 340] Let be a non-empty set. A (single-valued)
𝐴 𝑋
Neutrosophic Set on is characterized by three membership functions:
𝑇 𝑋 , , 𝐼 𝑋 , , 𝐹 𝑋 , ,
: → [0 1] : → [0 1] : → [0 1]
𝐴 𝐴 𝐴
𝑥 𝑋 𝑇 𝑥 𝐼 𝑥 𝐹 𝑥
∈ ( ) ( ) ( )
where for every , , , and denote the degrees of truth, indeterminacy, and falsity, respec-
𝐴 𝐴 𝐴
tively. These functions satisfy the following condition:
𝑇 𝑥 𝐼 𝑥 𝐹 𝑥 .
0 ≤ ( ) + ( ) + ( ) ≤ 3
𝐴 𝐴 𝐴
Example 2.12 (Analysis of Tasks). ”Analysis of Tasks” systematically examines tasks by breaking them into
components, evaluating resources, priorities, dependencies, and performance for optimization (cf. [70, 232]).
𝑈 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 𝑆
= { }
Let be a set of tasks. A Neutrosophic Set can assign the following degrees of truth, indetermi-
nacy, and falsity to each task:
𝑎 𝑇 𝑎 . 𝐼 𝑎 . 𝐹 𝑎 .
• Task : ( ) = 0 8, ( ) = 0 1, ( ) = 0 1
𝑏 𝑇 𝑏 . 𝐼 𝑏 . 𝐹 𝑏 .
• Task : ( ) = 0 5, ( ) = 0 3, ( ) = 0 2
𝑐 𝑇 𝑐 . 𝐼 𝑐 . 𝐹 𝑐 .
• Task : ( ) = 0 6, ( ) = 0 2, ( ) = 0 2
𝑎 𝑏
This setup illustrates a scenario where task has a high likelihood of success, task is relatively uncertain,
and task has a moderate chance of being true.
Example 2.13 (Analysis of Consumer Sentiment). ”Consumer Sentiment” measures individuals’ attitudes,
confidence, and feelings about economic conditions, influencing spending behavior and market trends [59,134].
Consider a product review . The sentiment of the review can be quantified using Neutrosophic Sets as follows:
𝑇 𝑥 .
• ( ) = 0 6: 60% of users convey positive feedback.
𝐼 𝑥 .
• ( ) = 0 3: 30% of users exhibit neutral or uncertain opinions.
𝐹 𝑥 .
• ( ) = 0 1: 10% of users express negative feedback.
Neutrosophic Sets have been widely applied in sentiment analysis to handle uncertainty and partial truths in
user opinions [31, 164, 190, 210, 283].
Theorem 2.14. A Neutrosophic Set can generalize both Fuzzy Sets and Crisp Sets.
Proof. This follows directly from the definition, as a Neutrosophic Set encompasses the structures of Fuzzy
(cid:131)
Sets and Crisp Sets as special cases.
As related concepts of Fuzzy Sets, the following are well-known: Hesitant Fuzzy Sets [72, 366, 367], Picture
Fuzzy Sets [6, 6, 80, 81, 253], Bipolar Fuzzy Sets [12, 13, 18, 61, 152, 248], Hyperfuzzy set [119, 136, 182,
349], Spherical fuzzy sets [25, 199, 200, 221, 338], and Tripolar Fuzzy Sets [288–290]. Additionally, related
concepts of the Neutrosophic Set include the Bipolar Neutrosophic Set [1, 239, 372], Neutrosophic Soft Set [7,
18,53,188,191], Hyperneutrosophic set [119], Neutrosophic offset [115,323,324,328–330,342] and Complex
Neutrosophic Set [16, 17], among others.
Furthermore, Fuzzy and Neutrosophic concepts have been studied not only in the context of sets but also in
various fields such as Graph Theory and Algebra [8, 10, 114, 116, 123, 126, 254]. Therefore, research on Fuzzy
and Neutrosophic frameworks is of great significance.
2.3 Plithogenic Set: A Generalization of Uncertain Sets
The Plithogenic Set is recognized as a type of set capable of generalizing Neutrosophic Sets, Fuzzy Sets, and
other similar uncertain sets [326, 327]. The definition of the Plithogenic Set is provided below.
𝑆 𝑃 𝑆 𝑃𝑆
Definition 2.15. [326, 327] Let be a universal set, and . A Plithogenic Set is defined as:
𝑃𝑆 𝑃, 𝑣, 𝑃𝑣, 𝑝𝑑𝑓 , 𝑝𝐶𝐹
= ( )
where:
• is an attribute.
𝑃𝑣 𝑣
• is the range of possible values for the attribute .
𝑝𝑑𝑓 𝑃 𝑃𝑣 , 𝑠
• : × → [0 1] is the Degree of Appurtenance Function (DAF).
𝑝𝐶𝐹 𝑃𝑣 𝑃𝑣 , 𝑡
• : × → [0 1] is the Degree of Contradiction Function (DCF).
𝑎, 𝑏 𝑃𝑣
These functions satisfy the following axioms for all :
1. Reflexivity of Contradiction Function:
𝑝𝐶𝐹 𝑎, 𝑎
( ) = 0
2. Symmetry of Contradiction Function:
𝑝𝐶𝐹 𝑎, 𝑏 𝑝𝐶𝐹 𝑏, 𝑎
( ) = ( )
Example 2.16. (cf. [125]) The following examples of Plithogenic sets are provided.
𝑠 𝑡 𝑃𝑆
• When = = 1, is called a Plithogenic Fuzzy Set.
𝑠 , 𝑡 𝑃𝑆
• When = 2 = 1, is called a Plithogenic Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set.
𝑠 , 𝑡 𝑃𝑆
• When = 3 = 1, is called a Plithogenic Neutrosophic Set.
𝑠 , 𝑡 𝑃𝑆
• When = 4 = 1, is called a Plithogenic quadripartitioned Neutrosophic Set (cf. [171, 287, 310]).
𝑠 , 𝑡 𝑃𝑆
• When = 5 = 1, is called a Plithogenic pentapartitioned Neutrosophic Set (cf. [46, 83, 223]).
𝑠 , 𝑡 𝑃𝑆
• When = 6 = 1, is called a Plithogenic hexapartitioned Neutrosophic Set (cf. [265]).
𝑠 , 𝑡 𝑃𝑆
• When = 7 = 1, is called a Plithogenic heptapartitioned Neutrosophic Set (cf. [52, 249]).
𝑠 , 𝑡 𝑃𝑆
• When = 8 = 1, is called a Plithogenic octapartitioned Neutrosophic Set.
𝑠 , 𝑡 𝑃𝑆
• When = 9 = 1, is called a Plithogenic nonapartitioned Neutrosophic Set.
The Plithogenic Set can generalize various sets that handle uncertainty, including Neutrosophic Sets and Fuzzy
Sets [119, 326]. Several derived concepts of the Plithogenic Set have been studied [91, 124, 229, 230, 315,
352], along with its applications in graph theory and related fields [125, 128, 129, 316]. Therefore, research on
Plithogenic Sets is as significant as that on Fuzzy Sets and Neutrosophic Sets.
2.4 Uncertain Logic
This subsection explains Uncertain Logic. Various types of logic, such as Fuzzy Logic [247,404,409], Intuition-
istic Fuzzy Logic [27,69,359], Neutrosophic Logic [130,319,321], Plithogenic Logic [327], and Upside-Down
Logic [127,336], have been studied under the umbrella of Uncertain Logic. Below, we introduce some of these
logics.
Definition 2.17 (Classical Logic). (cf. [75,79,101,312]) Classical Logic is a formal system of reasoning based
on binary truth values: true (1) and false (0). It operates under the principles of the law of identity, the law of
non-contradiction, and the law of excluded middle, ensuring that every proposition is either true or false, with
no intermediate states.
Definition 2.18 (Fuzzy Logic). [403] Fuzzy Logic is an extension of classical logic designed to handle rea-
soning under uncertainty and vagueness. It assigns a degree of truth to each proposition, rather than a binary
value (true or false). Formally, Fuzzy Logic is defined as a system:
, 𝜇, ,
F = (X R)
where:
• : A universal set of discourse, representing all possible elements under consideration.
𝜇 , 𝑥
• : X → [0 1] : A membership function that maps each element ∈ X to a degree of truth in the interval
[0 1]
, where:
𝜇 𝑥 𝑥
( ) = 1 if is fully true,
𝜇 𝑥 𝑥
( ) = 0 if is fully false.
< 𝜇 𝑥 <
Intermediate values (0 ( ) 1) represent partial truth.
• : A set of fuzzy rules or relations, typically of the form:
𝐴 𝑋 𝐵 𝑌 ,
If is then is
𝐴, 𝐵 𝑋, 𝑌
∈ X X
where and are fuzzy sets defined on .
Definition 2.19 (Neutrosophic Logic). [319] Neutrosophic Logic extends classical logic by assigning to each

3 Result and Discussion in this Paper
This section provides a concise explanation of the mathematical definitions and properties of Neutrosophic
Phenomenology and Neutrosophic Social Science discussed in this paper.
3.1 Neutrosophic Phenomenology: Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity
Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity is a novel concept introduced in [337]. This concept extends the
traditional idea of Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity by incorporating the principles of the Neutrosophic Set. If
we attempt to define it mathematically, it can be expressed as follows.
Definition 3.1 (Neutrosophic Phenomenology). Neutrosophic Phenomenology is the study of phenomena and
𝑇 𝐼
consciousness under uncertainty, incorporating neutrosophic components of truth ( ), indeterminacy ( ), and
falsity ( ). It provides a framework to model subjective experiences where information is incomplete, ambigu-
ous, or contradictory.
Definition 3.2 (Components of Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity). The Neutrosophic Body-Mind-
Soul-Spirit Fluidity (NBMSSF) integrates the four fundamental aspects of human existence—Body, Mind, Soul,
and Spirit—within the neutrosophic framework. Each component is defined as follows:
1. Body: Represents the physical aspect of a person, characterized by biological processes. In neutrosophy,
the body exists not merely in health or illness but also in neutral states, reflecting the dynamic balance and
transition between wellness, growth, and decay.
2. Mind: Encompasses cognitive functions like reasoning and memory. The mind, in neutrosophic terms, tran-
scends a binary rational/irrational framework, allowing for indeterminate states where beliefs and perceptions
coexist in varying degrees of clarity, ambiguity, and influence.
3. Soul: Represents the essence or immaterial core of a person. In neutrosophy, the soul is not limited to good
𝑇 𝐼 𝐹
or evil but fluctuates between true identity ( ), uncertain beliefs ( ), and societal misconceptions ( ), reflecting
the full spectrum of human emotional and spiritual experiences.
4. Spirit: Associated with transcendence and connection to the divine. Neutrosophy views the spirit as existing
𝑇 𝐼
in transitional states, balancing truths of divine experience ( ), uncertainties in belief ( ), and misconceptions
about spiritual practices ( ).
Example 3.3 (Real-Life Intuitive and Mathematically Correct Illustration of NBMSSF). Consider the case of
an individual recovering from a serious illness (cf. [85, 86]), reflecting the interplay of Body, Mind, Soul, and
Spirit within the Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity (NBMSSF) framework:
1. Body: The individual’s physical state fluctuates between health and illness. For instance, while the immune
𝑇 𝐹
system is actively recovering, the body exists in a dynamic state, not fully healthy ( ), not completely ill ( ),
and in a transitional phase ( ) as new treatments are being adapted.
2. Mind: Cognitively, the individual experiences varying degrees of clarity and confusion. For example,
𝑇 𝐼 𝐹
optimism about recovery ( ) may coexist with doubts about treatment efficacy ( ) or fear of relapse ( ), creating
a nuanced mental state.
𝑇 𝐹
3. Soul: Emotionally, the person may feel both gratitude for life ( ) and unresolved pain from the illness ( ),
alongside uncertainty about their spiritual purpose ( ). These fluctuations represent the complexity of the soul
in navigating existential questions.
4. Spirit: Spiritually, the person seeks connection with the divine or higher purpose. They may experience mo-
𝑇 𝐼
ments of profound clarity and faith ( ), intermixed with uncertainties about their beliefs ( ), or misconceptions
about spiritual practices ( ), especially during challenging times.
This example illustrates the NBMSSF concept by highlighting how each component operates within neutro-
sophic parameters, offering a more comprehensive understanding of human experiences in real-life situations.
Taking the above components into consideration, Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity is defined as
follows.
Definition 3.4 (Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity). Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity
(NBMSSF) is defined as a mathematical structure consisting of four interacting components Body, Mind, Soul,
𝑋 𝑇 𝑋
∈ { } ( )
and Spirit. Each component Body, Mind, Soul, Spirit is characterized by the Neutrosophic Triad ,
𝐼 𝑋 𝐹 𝑋
( ) ( )
, , which satisfies the following conditions:
1. Neutrosophic Triad:
𝑇 𝑋 ,

𝑇 𝑋 𝐼 𝑋 𝐹 𝑋 .
( ) + ( ) + ( ) = 1
𝑋 𝑌 , 𝑍, 𝑊
2. Dynamics: Each component ’s state is influenced by the other three components , expressed as a
F ( )
fluidity function :
𝑋 𝑓 𝑇 𝑌 , 𝐼 𝑌 , 𝐹 𝑌 , 𝑇 𝑍 , 𝐼 𝑍 , 𝐹 𝑍 , 𝑇 𝑊 , 𝐼 𝑊 , 𝐹 𝑊 ,
F ( ) = ( ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ))
where is the influence function, determined by the specific application.
3. Interdependency Model: The state of each component evolves as a system of differential equations:
𝑑𝑇 𝑋

𝑔 𝛼 𝑇 𝑌 𝛽 𝐹 𝑊 𝛼 𝛽
= ( ) − ( )
can include interactions between the components, such as , where and are
𝑇,𝑋 𝑋 𝑋 𝑋 𝑋
sensitivity coefficients.

which evolves over time .
5. Characteristic Function: Each component’s state transition is described by:
𝑇, 𝐼, 𝐹 𝛼 𝑇 𝑋 𝛽 𝐼 𝑋 𝛾 𝐹 𝑋 ,
Φ ( ) = ( ) + ( ) + ( )
𝑋 𝑋 𝑋 𝑋

where are context-dependent weights.

6. Constraints: To ensure global balance, the following constraint holds:

Remark 3.5. Fuzzy Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity is a special case of Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit
Fluidity where both indeterminacy and falsity are set to zero. Furthermore, Plithogenic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit
Fluidity is notable for its ability to generalize both Neutrosophic and Fuzzy Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity.
Example 3.6. Consider an individual who is generally healthy, mentally active, and emotionally balanced but
experiencing some uncertainty in spiritual matters. Their states are as follows:
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
• Body: ( Body ) = 0 7, ( Body ) = 0 2, ( Body ) = 0 1 (indicating good physical health).
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
• Mind: ( Mind ) = 0 5, ( Mind ) = 0 3, ( Mind ) = 0 2 (a mixture of clarity and indecision).
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
• Soul: ( Soul ) = 0 6, ( Soul ) = 0 2, ( Soul ) = 0 2 (emotional stability but with some conflicting
emotions).
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
• Spirit: ( Spirit ) = 0 4, ( Spirit ) = 0 4, ( Spirit ) = 0 2 (reflecting spiritual uncertainty).
The global fluidity matrix at this moment is:

Example 3.7. Consider an individual recovering from stress (cf. [350, 371]), where fatigue and indecision
dominate their state. Their characteristics are:
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
• Body: ( Body ) = 0 6, ( Body ) = 0 3, ( Body ) = 0 1 (recovering from physical exhaustion).
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
• Mind: ( Mind ) = 0 4, ( Mind ) = 0 5, ( Mind ) = 0 1 (struggling with mental clarity).
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
• Soul: ( Soul ) = 0 5, ( Soul ) = 0 4, ( Soul ) = 0 1 (seeking emotional balance).
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
• Spirit: ( Spirit ) = 0 3, ( Spirit ) = 0 5, ( Spirit ) = 0 2 (spiritually uncertain and seeking direction).
The fluidity matrix for this scenario is:

This example highlights how improving one aspect, such as practicing mindfulness to reduce Mind , can
𝑇 𝑇
( ) ( )
create cascading positive effects, improving both emotional balance ( Soul ) and spiritual clarity ( Spirit ).
Example 3.8. Suppose an individual achieves significant spiritual clarity and emotional stability after a trans-
formative event, such as a retreat or life-changing realization. Their states are:
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
• Body: ( Body ) = 0 8, ( Body ) = 0 1, ( Body ) = 0 1 (excellent physical health).
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
• Mind: ( Mind ) = 0 7, ( Mind ) = 0 2, ( Mind ) = 0 1 (sharp mental focus).
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
• Soul: ( Soul ) = 0 9, ( Soul ) = 0 05, ( Soul ) = 0 05 (peaceful emotional state).
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
• Spirit: ( Spirit ) = 0 85, ( Spirit ) = 0 1, ( Spirit ) = 0 05 (strong spiritual connection).
The fluidity matrix is:

This scenario models a person who has realigned their physical, mental, and spiritual dimensions, leading to a
harmonious state.
The theorems that hold in Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity are presented below.
Theorem 3.9. Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity has the structure of a Neutrosophic Set.
(cid:131)
Proof. This follows directly from the definition of Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity.
Theorem 3.10 (Invariant Triad Property). In the context of Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity, un-
der the specified dynamics, suppose the initial condition satisfies:
𝑇 𝑋 𝐼 𝑋 𝐹 𝑋 𝑡 .
( ) + ( ) + ( ) = 1 at = 0
0 0 0
Then for all ≥ 0, the following invariant holds:
𝑇 𝑋 𝐼 𝑋 𝐹 𝑋 .
( ) + ( ) + ( ) = 1
𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
𝑇 𝑋 𝐼 𝑋 𝐹 𝑋
( ) ( ) ( )
Proof. The dynamics of the system are governed by the differential equations for , , and .
Summing these equations, we have:
𝑑 𝑑𝑇 𝑋 𝑑𝐼 𝑋 𝑑𝐹 𝑋
( ) ( ) ( )
(cid:0) (cid:1)
𝑇 𝑋 𝐼 𝑋 𝐹 𝑋 .
( ) + ( ) + ( ) = + +
𝑑𝑡 𝑑𝑡 𝑑𝑡 𝑑𝑡
By the interdependency model, the rates of change satisfy:
𝑑𝑇 𝑋 𝑑𝐼 𝑋 𝑑𝐹 𝑋
( ) ( ) ( )
𝑔 𝑔 𝑔 .
+ + = + +
𝑇,𝑋 𝐼,𝑋 𝐹,𝑋
𝑑𝑡 𝑑𝑡 𝑑𝑡
𝑔 𝑔 𝑔
From the system definition, + + = 0. Thus:
𝑇,𝑋 𝐼,𝑋 𝐹,𝑋
(cid:0) (cid:1)
𝑇 𝑋 𝐼 𝑋 𝐹 𝑋 .
( ) + ( ) + ( ) = 0
𝑑𝑡
𝑇 𝑋 𝐼 𝑋 𝐹 𝑋 𝑇 𝑋
( ) + ( ) + ( ) ( ) +
Integrating over time, the sum remains constant, and given the initial condition
𝐼 𝑋 𝐹 𝑋
( ) + ( ) = 1, the result follows:
0 0
𝑇 𝑋 𝐼 𝑋 𝐹 𝑋 𝑡 .
( ) + ( ) + ( ) = 1 for all ≥ 0
𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
(cid:131)
Theorem 3.11 (Non-Negativity and Boundedness). In the context of Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Flu-
idity, assume the initial condition:
𝑇 𝑋 , 𝐼 𝑋 , 𝐹 𝑋 , .
( ) ( ) ( ) ∈ [0 1]
0 0 0
Then for any ≥ 0, the following holds:
𝑇 𝑋 , 𝐼 𝑋 , 𝐹 𝑋 , .
( ) ( ) ( ) ∈ [0 1]
𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
𝑇 𝑋 𝐼 𝑋 𝐹 𝑋
Proof. The invariant property (Theorem 3.10) ensures that the sum ( ) + ( ) + ( ) = 1 holds for all
𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
𝑡 𝑇 𝑋 ,
≥ 0. Assume by contradiction that one of the components, say ( ) , leaves the interval [0 1] .
𝑇 𝑋 > 𝐼 𝑋 𝐹 𝑋 < 𝑇 𝑋 < 𝐼 𝑋
If ( ) 1, then ( ) + ( ) 0, which violates non-negativity. Similarly, if ( ) 0, then ( ) +
𝑡 𝑡 𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
𝐹 𝑋 >
( ) 1, which is also impossible.
Using standard comparison theorems for differential equations and ensuring non-negativity through Grönwall’s
𝑇 𝑋 𝐼 𝑋 𝐹 𝑋 ,
inequality, the components
( )
( )
, and
( )
are bounded within
[0 1]
. Hence:
𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
𝑇 𝑋 , 𝐼 𝑋 , 𝐹 𝑋 , 𝑡 .
( ) ( ) ( ) ∈ [0 1] for all ≥ 0
𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
(cid:131)
Theorem 3.12 (Global Balance Constraint). In the context of Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity,
let the Global Fluidity Matrix at time be:
𝑇 𝐼 𝐹

Body Body Body

Then the total balance constraint holds:

(cid:2) (cid:3)
𝑇 𝑋 𝐼 𝑋 𝐹 𝑋 𝑡 .
( ) + ( ) + ( ) = 4 for all ≥ 0
𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
𝑋 , , ,
∈{Body Mind Soul Spirit}
𝑋 𝑇 𝑋 𝐼 𝑋 𝐹 𝑋 𝑡
Proof. From Theorem 3.10, each component satisfies ( ) + ( ) + ( ) = 1 for all ≥ 0. Summing
𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
over all components:
(cid:213)
(cid:2) (cid:3)
𝑇 𝑋 𝐼 𝑋 𝐹 𝑋 .
( ) + ( ) + ( ) = 4 · 1 = 4
𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
𝑋 , , ,

This holds for all ≥ 0, completing the proof.
Based on the discussion above, we redefine Dynamic Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity. This

formal definitions and associated properties are presented below.
Definition 3.13 (Dynamic Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity). Dynamic Neutrosophic Body-Mind-

Example 3.14 (Rehabilitation Scenario). Consider an individual undergoing rehabilitation for a sports injury
(cf. [201]):

ing the healing process, and Body accounts for residual impairment or setbacks.

As rehabilitation progresses over time , each triad evolves dynamically based on the

individual’s physical therapy, mental training, emotional support, and spiritual practices. The Invariant Triad

Property ensures ( ) + ( ) + ( ) = 1 for each component, while the Global Balance Constraint enforces

the total sum to remain 4 at any time .
Theorem 3.15. Dynamic Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity possesses the structure of a Neutro-

Proof. This result follows directly from the definition of Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity, as each
𝑇, 𝐼, 𝐹
( )
component (Body, Mind, Soul, and Spirit) is represented using the Neutrosophic Triad , which satisfies
(cid:131)
the axioms of a Neutrosophic Set.
Theorem 3.16. Dynamic Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity can be transformed into Neutrosophic
Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity by omitting temporal dependencies.
Proof. This follows from the definition of Dynamic Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity. By setting
𝑇 𝑋 , 𝐼 𝑋 , 𝐹 𝑋 𝑡
the time-dependent functions ( ) ( ) ( ) to their initial values at = 0, the model reduces to the static

(cid:131)
form of Neutrosophic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity.
Question 3.17. Related concepts such as Holistic Well-Being [410], Embodied Cognition [308, 397], Mind-
fulness and Meditation Practices [82, 418], and Psychoneuroimmunology [234, 245] are well-known.
Is it possible to extend these concepts using Fuzzy Sets and Neutrosophic Sets? Furthermore, what would their
applications and mathematical structures entail?
3.2 Logic of Phenomenology
There is a deep connection between phenomenology and logic, and several logical systems have been studied in
this context. This subsection explores the logic within phenomenology, including considerations of its potential
extension to Neutrosophic Logic.
3.2.1 Neutrosophic Intentional Logic
Intentional concepts in phenomenology describe how consciousness always aims at or is directed toward ob-
jects, revealing the relationship between subject and object in experience (cf. [65,89,374,375,413]). Intentional
Logic studies the structure of intentionality, analyzing how mental states are directed toward objects, contents,
or propositions systematically (cf. [343, 383]).
Definition 3.18 (Intentional Logic). Intentional Logic formalizes the structure of intentionality, defined as the
directedness of mental states toward objects or contents. Let:
• : the set of all possible worlds.
• : the set of subjects (agents).
• : the set of objects (including abstract entities).
B ,
= {0 1}
: the Boolean domain indicating intentional states.
𝑠 𝑆 𝑜 𝑂 𝑤 𝑊
∈ ∈ ∈
The intentionality of a subject toward an object in a world is modeled as a relation:
𝐼 𝑆 𝑂 𝑊 B,
: × × →
𝐼 𝑠, 𝑜, 𝑤 𝑠 𝑜 𝑤
where ( ) = 1 indicates that intentionally directs their mental state toward in .
Intentional Content. The intentional content of a subject is defined as:
𝑜, 𝑤 𝐼 𝑠, 𝑜, 𝑤 .
I = {( ) | ( ) = 1}

Example 3.21 (Neutrosophic Intentional Logic). Consider an agent thinking about the proposition : ”The
market will grow by 10% next year” in the world . The intentionality is modeled as:
𝐼 𝑠, 𝑜, 𝑤 𝑇, 𝐼, 𝐹 ,

where = 0 6, = 0 3, and = 0 1. This means:

• The agent believes the proposition is 60% true ( = 0 6).
𝐼 .
• There is a 30% level of uncertainty or indeterminacy due to insufficient data ( = 0 3).
𝐹 .
• The agent believes the proposition is 10% false ( = 0 1).

3.2.2 Neutrosophic Ontological Logic
Ontology is the study of existence and reality, exploring entities, their properties, relationships, and categories
[99, 149, 151, 160, 344]. Ontology is often studied in connection with phenomenology [261]. Concepts like
Ontological Logic [262, 302] are also recognized within ontology.
To define this within the framework of Neutrosophic Logic, we first mathematically define Ontological Logic
and then extend it. The definition is provided below.
Definition 3.22 (Ontological Logic). Ontological Logic formalizes the relationships, properties, and existence
of entities. Let:
• : the universe of discourse, partitioned into:
𝑈 𝐸 𝑃 𝑅 𝑇,
= ∪ ∪ ∪
𝐸 𝑃 𝑅 𝑇
where : entities, : properties, : relations, and : time.
𝜎 𝑃 𝐸 𝑇 B
• : × × → : a function assigning truth values to properties of entities at specific times.
𝑅 𝐸 𝐸 B
• : × → : a function defining binary relations between entities.
The ontological structure is defined as a tuple:
𝐸, 𝑃, 𝑅, 𝑇, 𝜎 .
O = ( )
Core Axioms. Ontological Logic satisfies the following axioms:
𝑒 𝐸 𝑝 𝑃 𝑡 𝑇
∈ ∈ ∈
1. Identity: For every entity , there exists at least one property and time such that
𝜎 𝑝, 𝑒, 𝑡
( ) = 1.
𝑒 𝐸, 𝑝 𝑃, 𝑡 𝑇 𝜎 𝑝, 𝑒, 𝑡 𝜎 𝑝, 𝑒, 𝑡
2. Non-Contradiction: For any ∈ ∈ ∈ , ( ) = 1 implies (¬ ) = 0.
𝑝 𝑃 𝜎 𝑝, 𝑒, 𝑡 𝜎 𝑝, 𝑒, 𝑡
3. Temporal Consistency: For persistent properties ∈ , if ( ) = 1, then ( ) = 1 for all
1 2
𝑡 𝑡
2 1
Mereological Relations. Part-whole relationships are formalized as:
𝑃 𝐸 𝐸,
⊆ ×
𝑒 , 𝑒 𝑃 𝑒 𝑒
( ) ∈
where indicates that is a part of . The following properties hold:
1 2 1 2
𝑒 , 𝑒 , 𝑒 , 𝑒 𝑃 𝑒 , 𝑒 𝑃
• Transitivity:
( ) ( ) ∈ =⇒ ( ) ∈
𝑊 𝑊
1 2 2 3 1 3
𝑒 , 𝑒 𝑃 𝑒 , 𝑒 𝑃 𝑒 𝑒
• Antisymmetry: ( ) ∈ ∧ ( ) ∈ =⇒ = .
𝑊 𝑊
1 2 2 1 1 2
Example 3.23 (Ontological Logic in Healthcare System). Consider a healthcare system (cf. [44, 416]) where
entities, properties, relations, and time are formalized as follows:
𝐸 , , ,
= { }
• Patient Doctor Medication Treatment Plan : A set of entities.
𝑃 , , ,
= { }
• isHealthy isPrescribed isAdministered isEffective : A set of properties.
𝑅 , ,
= { }
• treats prescribes monitors : A set of relations between entities.
𝑇 , , . . . ,
= { }
• Day 1 Day 2 Day 30 : A set of time points.
Property Assignment. The property function assigns truth values to properties of entities over time:
(cid:40)
𝑡,
1 if the medication is prescribed at time
𝜎 , , 𝑡
( ) =
isPrescribed Medication
0 otherwise
Relations. The relation function formalizes interactions between entities. For example:
𝑅 , , 𝑅 , .
( ) = ( ) =
Doctor Patient treats Doctor Medication prescribes
Core Axioms in Context. The core axioms of Ontological Logic can be applied to this healthcare example:
𝑒 𝐸 𝑝 𝑃 𝑡
∈ ∈
• Identity: Every patient must have at least one property at a specific time :
𝑝 𝑃, 𝑡 𝑇 𝜎 𝑝, , 𝑡 .
∃ ∈ ∈ s.t. ( Patient ) = 1
𝜎 , ,
Example: ( isHealthy Patient Day 10 ) = 1.
• Non-Contradiction: A medication cannot simultaneously be prescribed and not prescribed at the same
time:
𝜎 , , 𝑡 𝜎 , , 𝑡 .
( isPrescribed Medication ) = 1 =⇒ (¬ isPrescribed Medication ) = 0
• Temporal Consistency: If a treatment plan is effective on Day 5, it must remain effective for subsequent
days unless modified:
𝜎 , , 𝜎 , , 𝑡 𝑡 .
( isEffective Treatment Plan Day 5 ) = 1 =⇒ ( isEffective Treatment Plan ) = 1 ∀ ≥ Day 5
Mereological Relations. Part-whole relationships in the healthcare system are defined as follows:
𝑃 , .
= {( )}
Medication Treatment Plan
𝑒 𝑒
Here, medication is a part of the treatment plan . The transitivity and antisymmetry properties hold:
1 2
• Transitivity: If Medication A is part of Treatment Plan X, and Treatment Plan X is part of Healthcare
Protocol Y, then Medication A is part of Healthcare Protocol Y.
, 𝑃 , 𝑃
( ) ∈ ∧ ( ) ∈
Medication A Treatment Plan X Treatment Plan X Healthcare Protocol Y
𝑊 𝑊
, 𝑃 .
=⇒ ( ) ∈
Medication A Healthcare Protocol Y
• Antisymmetry: If Medication A is part of Treatment Plan X and vice versa, then Medication A and
Treatment Plan X are identical:
, 𝑃 , 𝑃
( ) ∈ ∧ ( ) ∈
Medication A Treatment Plan X Treatment Plan X Medication A
𝑊 𝑊
=⇒ =
Medication A Treatment Plan X
The definition of Neutrosophic Ontological Logic, which incorporates the principles of Neutrosophic Logic
into Ontological Logic, is provided below.
Definition 3.24 (Neutrosophic Ontological Logic). Neutrosophic Ontological Logic extends classical Onto-
𝑇 𝐼 𝐹
logical Logic by incorporating the neutrosophic components of truth ( ), indeterminacy ( ), and falsity ( ).
Let:
• : the universe of discourse, partitioned as:

= ∪ ∪ ∪
𝐸 𝑃 𝑅 𝑇
where : entities, : properties, : relations, and : time.
• N = [0 , 1]3 : the neutrosophic domain, where ( 𝑇, 𝐼, 𝐹 ) satisfies 0 ≤ 𝑇 + 𝐼 + 𝐹 ≤ 1.
𝜎𝑁 𝑃 𝐸 𝑇 N
• : × × → : a function assigning neutrosophic truth values to properties of entities at specific
times.
𝑅𝑁 𝐸 𝐸 𝑇 N
• : × × → : a function assigning neutrosophic truth values to binary relations between entities.
The neutrosophic ontological structure is defined as a tuple:
𝑁 𝑁 𝑁
𝐸, 𝑃, 𝑅, 𝑇, 𝜎 , 𝑅 .
O = ( )
Core Axioms. Neutrosophic Ontological Logic satisfies the following axioms:
𝑒 𝐸 𝑝 𝑃 𝑡 𝑇
∈ ∈ ∈
1. Neutrosophic Identity: For every entity , there exists at least one property and time
such that:

𝑒 𝐸, 𝑝 𝑃, 𝑡 𝑇 𝜎𝑁 𝑝, 𝑒, 𝑡 𝑇, 𝐼, 𝐹

Remark 3.25 (Neutrosophic Ontological Logic). Fuzzy Ontological Logic is a special case of Neutrosophic
Ontological Logic where both indeterminacy and falsity are set to zero. Furthermore, Plithogenic Ontological
Logic is notable for its ability to generalize both Neutrosophic and Fuzzy Ontological Logic.
Example 3.26 (Neutrosophic Ontological Logic for healthcare system). Consider a healthcare system modeled
as with:
• : a hospital.
• : a healthcare network to which the hospital belongs.
• : the property ”provides emergency services.”
• : the current time.
𝑝 𝑒 𝑡
Property Evaluation. The property for the entity at is evaluated as:
𝜎 𝑝, 𝑒 , 𝑡 . , . , . ,
( ) = (0 8 0 1 0 1)
indicating that:
𝑇 .
• There is an 80% certainty ( = 0 8) that the hospital provides emergency services.
𝐼 .
• There is a 10% uncertainty ( = 0 1) due to incomplete data.
𝐹 .
• There is a 10% falsity ( = 0 1) based on occasional service disruptions.
Mereological Relation. The hospital’s membership in the healthcare network is represented as:
𝑅 𝑒 , 𝑒 , 𝑡 . , . , . ,
( ) = (0 9 0 05 0 05)
1 2
𝑇 . 𝐼 .
indicating a 90% certainty ( = 0 9) that the hospital is part of the network, with 5% uncertainty ( = 0 05)
𝐹 .
and 5% falsity ( = 0 05) due to occasional administrative errors.
𝑝 𝑡(cid:48) > 𝑡
Temporal Consistency. If represents ”provides emergency services,” and at a later time , the hospi-
tal’s performance declines, the evaluation might adjust to:
𝜎 𝑝, 𝑒 , 𝑡(cid:48) . , . , . .
( ) = (0 6 0 2 0 2)
𝑇 . 𝐹 .
This reflects reduced certainty ( = 0 6) and increased falsity ( = 0 2) due to degraded service.
3.3 Neutrosophic Social Analysis
This subsection provides a mathematical definition of the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act), DMAIC (Define-Measure-
Analyze-Improve-Control), SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats), and OODA Loop
(Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) cycles using the concept of Neutrosophic Sets, incorporating truth, indetermi-
nacy, and falsehood degrees for decision-making under uncertainty.
First, as a broad perspective, Neutrosophic Social Analysis is roughly defined as follows. It extends Social
Analysis by incorporating the principles of Neutrosophic Logic.
Definition 3.27 (Neutrosophic Social Analysis). Neutrosophic Social Analysis is the evaluation of social sys-
tems, behaviors, and relationships under uncertainty. It incorporates neutrosophic components of truth ( ),
𝐼 𝐹
indeterminacy ( ), and falsity ( ) to model complex, ambiguous, or conflicting social dynamics.
3.3.1 PDCA Cycle with Neutrosophic Sets
The PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle is a continuous improvement framework consisting of four stages: plan-
ning, implementing, evaluating results, and refining processes [133, 173, 256, 291]. These four stages are ex-
tended within the framework of Neutrosophic Sets as follows. It is worth noting that several studies have
explored the application of the PDCA cycle in the Fuzzy domain and the Neutrosophic domain [24, 137, 392].
Definition 3.28 (Neutrosophic PDCA cycle). The Neutrosophic PDCA cycle is an extension of the traditional
Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, incorporating Neutrosophic Sets to model uncertainty, indeterminacy, and
truth. The cycle consists of four stages:
1. Plan (P): Represented by a Neutrosophic Set :
𝑃 𝑥, 𝑇 𝑥 , 𝐼 𝑥 , 𝐹 𝑥 𝑥 ,
= {( ( ) ( ) ( )) | ∈ }
Planning Elements
𝑃 𝑃 𝑃
where:
𝑇 𝑥
( )
• : Degree to which the plan is expected to succeed.
𝐼 𝑥
( )
• : Degree of uncertainty associated with the plan.
𝐹 𝑥
( )
• : Degree to which the plan is expected to fail.
2. Do (D): Represented by a Neutrosophic Set :
𝐷 𝑦, 𝑇 𝑦 , 𝐼 𝑦 , 𝐹 𝑦 𝑦 ,
= {( ( ) ( ) ( )) | ∈ }
Execution Elements
𝐷 𝐷 𝐷
where:
𝑇 𝑦
( )
• : Degree to which the execution is successful.
𝐼 𝑦
( )
• : Degree of uncertainty during execution.
𝐹 𝑦
( )
• : Degree to which the execution is unsuccessful.
3. Check (C): Represented by a Neutrosophic Set :
𝐶 𝑧, 𝑇 𝑧 , 𝐼 𝑧 , 𝐹 𝑧 𝑧 ,
= {( ( ) ( ) ( )) | ∈ }
Evaluation Criteria
𝐶 𝐶 𝐶
where:
𝑇 𝑧
( )
• : Degree to which evaluation criteria are met.
𝐼 𝑧
( )
• : Degree of uncertainty in the evaluation process.
𝐹 𝑧
( )
• : Degree to which evaluation criteria are not met.
4. Act (A): Represented by a Neutrosophic Set :
𝐴 𝑤, 𝑇 𝑤 , 𝐼 𝑤 , 𝐹 𝑤 𝑤 ,
= {( ( ) ( ) ( )) | ∈ }
Improvement Elements
𝐴 𝐴 𝐴
where:
𝑇 𝑤
( )
• : Degree to which the improvement is effective.
𝐼 𝑤
( )
• : Degree of uncertainty in the improvement’s impact.
𝐹 𝑤
( )
• : Degree to which the improvement is ineffective.
Example 3.29. Consider applying the Neutrosophic PDCA cycle to a marketing campaign (cf. [250, 279]):
• Plan (P): Tasks such as ”Develop Ad Content” and ”Set Budget” might have the following values:
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Develop Ad Content: 𝑃 = 0 7, 𝑃 = 0 2, 𝑃 = 0 1
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Set Budget: 𝑃 = 0 6, 𝑃 = 0 3, 𝑃 = 0 1
• Do (D): Execution tasks such as ”Run Ad Campaign” and ”Monitor Metrics”:
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Run Ad Campaign: 𝐷 = 0 8, 𝐷 = 0 1, 𝐷 = 0 1
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Monitor Metrics: 𝐷 = 0 6, 𝐷 = 0 3, 𝐷 = 0 1
• Check (C): Evaluation criteria such as ”ROI Improvement [206]” and ”Engagement Increase [157]”:
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– ROI Improvement: 𝐶 = 0 7, 𝐶 = 0 2, 𝐶 = 0 1
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Engagement Increase: 𝐶 = 0 5, 𝐶 = 0 4, 𝐶 = 0 1
• Act (A): Improvement actions such as ”Adjust Budget” and ”Redesign Ad Content”:
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Adjust Budget: 𝐴 = 0 6, 𝐴 = 0 3, 𝐴 = 0 1
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Redesign Ad Content: 𝐴 = 0 8, 𝐴 = 0 1, 𝐴 = 0 1
This demonstrates how the Neutrosophic PDCA cycle integrates uncertainty and truth degrees into planning,
execution, evaluation, and improvement stages.
Theorem 3.30. Neutrosophic PDCA cycle has the structure of a Neutrosophic Set.
(cid:131)
Proof. This follows directly from the definition of Neutrosophic PDCA cycle.
Question 3.31. Numerous derived concepts of PDCA, such as the PDSA Cycle (Plan-Do-Study-Act) [66, 102,
205,292], OPDCA Cycle (Observe-Plan-Do-Check-Act) [179,351], and SDCA Cycle (Standardize-Do-Check-
Act) [22, 104, 211], are widely known.
What characteristics emerge when concepts like Neutrosophic Sets are applied to these derived cycles? Fur-
thermore, what potential applications could result from such adaptations?
3.3.2 DMAIC Cycle with Neutrosophic Sets
The DMAIC Cycle is a Six Sigma methodology [231,263] designed for process improvement [242]. It consists
of five phases: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control, aiming to optimize processes systemati-
cally [224, 242, 285, 286, 300, 356]. This framework is widely utilized in business management and has also
been explored in Fuzzy and Neutrosophic contexts [141, 143, 402]. The following outlines an extension of the
DMAIC Cycle using Neutrosophic Sets.
Definition 3.32 (Neutrosophic DMAIC cycle). The Neutrosophic DMAIC cycle is an extension of the tradi-
tional Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control (DMAIC) cycle, incorporating Neutrosophic Sets to model
uncertainty, indeterminacy, and truth. The cycle consists of five stages:

where:
𝑇 𝑤

• : Degree to which the improvement fails.
5. Control (C): Represented by a Neutrosophic Set :
𝐶 𝑣, 𝑇 𝑣 , 𝐼 𝑣 , 𝐹 𝑣 𝑣 ,

𝐹 𝑣
( )
• : Degree to which control is ineffective.
Example 3.33. A production process is a sequence of operations transforming raw materials into finished
products efficiently [197, 313]. Consider applying the Neutrosophic DMAIC cycle to improve a production
process:
• Define (D): Tasks such as ”Identify Core Needs” and ”Set Goals”:
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Identify Core Needs: 𝐷 = 0 8, 𝐷 = 0 1, 𝐷 = 0 1
𝑓 𝑓 𝑓
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Set Goals: 𝐷 = 0 7, 𝐷 = 0 2, 𝐷 = 0 1
𝑓 𝑓 𝑓
• Measure (M): Measuring performance metrics like ”Production Efficiency” and ”Customer Satisfaction”:
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Production Efficiency: 𝑀 = 0 9, 𝑀 = 0 05, 𝑀 = 0 05
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Customer Satisfaction: 𝑀 = 0 7, 𝑀 = 0 2, 𝑀 = 0 1
• Analyze (A): Analyzing issues such as ”Supply Chain Delays” and ”Equipment Downtime”:

• Control (C): Control measures like ”Real-Time Monitoring” and ”Automated Alerts”:
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Real-Time Monitoring: 𝐶 = 0 9, 𝐶 = 0 05, 𝐶 = 0 05
𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Automated Alerts: 𝐶 = 0 8, 𝐶 = 0 1, 𝐶 = 0 1

This demonstrates how the Neutrosophic DMAIC cycle integrates uncertainty and truth degrees into defining,
measuring, analyzing, improving, and controlling stages.
Theorem 3.34. Neutrosophic DMAIC cycle has the structure of a Neutrosophic Set.
(cid:131)
Proof. This follows directly from the definition of Neutrosophic DMAIC cycle.
Question 3.35. Several derived concepts of the DMAIC cycle are widely recognized, including the DMADV
Cycle (Define-Measure-Analyze-Design-Verify) [38, 155, 348] and the DCOV Cycle (Define-Characterize-
Optimize-Verify) [30, 203].
What unique characteristics arise when concepts such as Neutrosophic Sets are incorporated into these derived
cycles? Additionally, what potential applications might be enabled by such adaptations?
3.3.3 SWOT Analysis with Neutrosophic Sets
SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning tool used to assess a project or organization’s internal and external
factors. It identifies four key dimensions: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, aiming to develop
effective strategies [2, 93, 140, 237, 305, 311, 391].
This framework is widely applied across various industries, including business, education [2], and healthcare
[281], and has also been studied within Fuzzy and Neutrosophic contexts [37,163,309]. The following outlines
an extension of SWOT Analysis using Neutrosophic Sets.
Definition 3.36. The Neutrosophic SWOT Analysis extends the traditional Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-
Threats framework by incorporating Neutrosophic Sets to model uncertainty, indeterminacy, and truth. The
analysis consists of four components:
1. Strengths (S): Represented by a Neutrosophic Set :

Example 3.37. Consider applying Neutrosophic SWOT Analysis to evaluate a company:
• Strengths (S): ”Brand Recognition [153]” and ”Skilled Workforce [376]”:
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Brand Recognition: 𝑆 = 0 9, 𝑆 = 0 05, 𝑆 = 0 05

This analysis demonstrates how Neutrosophic Sets model strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats with
varying degrees of truth, uncertainty, and falsehood.

Question 3.39. Several extended concepts of SWOT Analysis are widely recognized, including SWOC Anal-
ysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Challenges) [33, 55, 177, 264, 284], SOAR Analysis (Strengths,
Opportunities, Aspirations, Results) [174, 354, 355, 357], and Dynamic SWOT Analysis [45, 178, 396].
What mathematical characteristics and potential applications could emerge if these frameworks were extended
using Neutrosophic Sets?
3.3.4 OODA Cycle with Neutrosophic Sets
The OODA Cycle (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) is a decision-making framework designed to enable effective
responses in dynamic and competitive environments [131,198,236,282,298,415]. It emphasizes observing the
situation, orienting oneself based on the context, making informed decisions, and taking timely actions. The
following outlines an extension of the OODA Cycle using Neutrosophic Sets.
Definition 3.40. The Neutrosophic OODA Loop extends the traditional Observe-Orient-Decide-Act framework
by incorporating Neutrosophic Sets to model uncertainty, indeterminacy, and truth. The loop consists of four
stages:
1. Observe (O): Represented by a Neutrosophic Set :

Example 3.41. Consider applying the Neutrosophic OODA Loop to a business decision:
• Observe (O): Observing market trends such as ”Customer Preferences [347]” and ”Competitor Actions
[26]”:
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .

• Orient (O): Orienting strategies based on ”Market Positioning [60]” and ”Customer Segmentation [74]”:
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Market Positioning: 𝑂 = 0 7, 𝑂 = 0 2, 𝑂 = 0 1
𝑟 𝑟 𝑟
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Customer Segmentation: 𝑂 = 0 8, 𝑂 = 0 1, 𝑂 = 0 1
𝑟 𝑟 𝑟
• Decide (D): Making decisions on ”Budget Allocation [414]” and ”Market Entry [186]”:
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Budget Allocation: 𝐷 = 0 7, 𝐷 = 0 2, 𝐷 = 0 1
𝑐 𝑐 𝑐
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Market Entry: 𝐷 = 0 6, 𝐷 = 0 3, 𝐷 = 0 1
𝑐 𝑐 𝑐
• Act (A): Implementing actions like ”Launch New Product” and ”Improve Distribution Channels”:
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Launch New Product: 𝐴 = 0 8, 𝐴 = 0 1, 𝐴 = 0 1

𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Improve Distribution Channels: 𝐴 = 0 7, 𝐴 = 0 2, 𝐴 = 0 1

This example illustrates how the Neutrosophic OODA Loop integrates truth, uncertainty, and falsehood degrees
into observing, orienting, deciding, and acting stages.
Theorem 3.42. Neutrosophic OODA Loop has the structure of a Neutrosophic Set.

Proof. This follows directly from the definition of Neutrosophic OODA Loop.
3.3.5 Neutrosophic Porter’s Five Forces Analysis
Neutrosophic Porter’s Five Forces Analysis is an extended framework based on the classic Porter’s Five Forces
Analysis. This approach evaluates industry competition through five key factors: rivalry among existing com-
petitors, bargaining power of buyers, bargaining power of suppliers, threat of substitutes, and threat of new
entrants [94, 150, 277, 278].
Several related studies have been conducted within the contexts of Fuzzy Sets and Neutrosophic Sets [240].
The formal definition is provided below.
Definition 3.43. The Neutrosophic Porter’s Five Forces Analysis extends the traditional framework by incor-
porating Neutrosophic Sets to model uncertainty, indeterminacy, and truth across the five competitive forces:

2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers (S): Represented by a Neutrosophic Set :

𝐹 𝑤 𝑤
( )
• : Degree to which does not influence the threat of substitutes.
5. Industry Rivalry (R): Represented by a Neutrosophic Set :
𝑅 𝑣, 𝑇 𝑣 , 𝐼 𝑣 , 𝐹 𝑣 𝑣 ,

( )
• : Degree to which intensifies industry rivalry.
𝐼 𝑣 𝑣
( )
• : Degree of uncertainty regarding the influence of .
𝐹 𝑣 𝑣
( )
• : Degree to which does not influence industry rivalry.
Example 3.44. Consider applying Neutrosophic Porter’s Five Forces Analysis to a retail business (cf. [208]):
• Threat of New Entrants (N): Factors such as ”Low Capital Requirements” and ”Lack of Brand Loyalty”:
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Low Capital Requirements: 𝑁 = 0 8, 𝑁 = 0 15, 𝑁 = 0 05
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Lack of Brand Loyalty: 𝑁 = 0 7, 𝑁 = 0 2, 𝑁 = 0 1
• Bargaining Power of Suppliers (S): Factors such as ”Few Suppliers” and ”High Switching Costs”:
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Few Suppliers: 𝑆 = 0 9, 𝑆 = 0 05, 𝑆 = 0 05

– Low Cost of Substitutes: 𝑈 = 0 7, 𝑈 = 0 2, 𝑈 = 0 1
• Industry Rivalry (R): Factors such as ”High Number of Competitors” and ”Slow Market Growth”:
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– High Number of Competitors: 𝑅 = 0 9, 𝑅 = 0 05, 𝑅 = 0 05
𝑇 . 𝐼 . 𝐹 .
– Slow Market Growth: 𝑅 = 0 8, 𝑅 = 0 1, 𝑅 = 0 1
This example illustrates how Neutrosophic Sets can quantify and model the dynamics of Porter’s Five Forces
in the context of a competitive market.
Theorem 3.45. Neutrosophic Porter’s Five Forces has the structure of a Neutrosophic Set.

Proof. This follows directly from the definition of Neutrosophic Porter’s Five Forces.
Question 3.46. As a related concept, frameworks such as six-forces analysis have been studied [19,48,49,189].
Can the principles of Neutrosophic Logic be applied to these frameworks, and what potential applications might
emerge?
3.4 Some Neutrosophic (Social or Business) Logic
In the field of Social Science, various logics have been studied (e.g., [21,176,257]). This paper aims to explore
potential extensions of these logics, including their expansion into Neutrosophic Logic.
3.4.1 Neutrosophic Institutional Logics
Institutional Logics are frameworks guiding behavior within societal institutions, integrating material practices
and symbolic systems to shape actions and norms [43, 362–364].

Remark 3.50 (Neutrosophic Institutional Logic). Fuzzy Institutional Logic is a special case of Neutrosophic
Institutional Logic where both indeterminacy and falsity are set to zero. Furthermore, Plithogenic Institutional
Logic is notable for its ability to generalize both Neutrosophic and Fuzzy Institutional Logic.

The following describes Institutional Neutrosophic Logics, which extend this concept using Neutrosophic
Logic.
Definition 3.52 (Institutional Neutrosophic Logics). Institutional Neutrosophic Logics extend classical Insti-
tutional Logics by incorporating uncertainty, represented by the neutrosophic components of truth (T), indeter-
minacy (I), and falsity (F). Formally, an Institutional Neutrosophic Logic is defined as:
, , , , ,
L = (I S R C N )
where maps each proposition about an institutional action or state to a neutrosophic value:
𝑃 𝑇, 𝐼, 𝐹 ,
N ( ) = ( )
𝑇, 𝐼, 𝐹 , 𝑇 𝐼 𝐹
with ∈ [0 1] satisfying 0 ≤ + + ≤ 1.
𝑇 𝑃
• : Degree to which is true within the institutional logic.
𝐼 𝑃
• : Degree to which is indeterminate due to conflicting or insufficient evidence.
𝐹 𝑃

The behavior under Institutional Neutrosophic Logics is defined by a neutrosophic utility function:

Remark 3.53. Institutional Fuzzy Logic is a special case of Institutional Neutrosophic Logic where both in-
determinacy and falsity are set to zero. Furthermore, Institutional Plithogenic Logic can also be defined using
Plithogenic Logic.

3.4.2 Dominant Neutrosophic Logic
Dominant Logic refers to the mindset or cognitive framework organizations use to make decisions, allocate
resources, and interpret information, shaping strategy and performance [162, 193, 204, 280, 295, 378].

Definition 3.59 (Dominant Logic). (cf. [378]) Let be a firm operating a portfolio of businesses 𝑛 .

The Dominant Logic of the firm is a cognitive and operational framework defined as:
, , , ,
L = (S D K P)
where:
𝑆 , 𝑆 , . . . , 𝑆 𝑆
S = { }
• : A set of schemas, where each schema is a mapping:

that transforms environmental inputs (e.g., market trends) into actionable decisions .
• : A decision-making function defined as:

where represents strategic variables (e.g., product pricing, market share), represents organizational
capabilities, and
D (v c)
is the resource allocation decision.

comes (e.g., revenue, market share) to a real-valued evaluation.
Remark 3.60 (Neutrosophic Dominant Logic). Fuzzy Dominant Logic is a special case of Neutrosophic Dom-
inant Logic where both indeterminacy and falsity are set to zero. Furthermore, Plithogenic Dominant Logic is
notable for its ability to generalize both Neutrosophic and Fuzzy Dominant Logic.
Example 3.61 (Application of Dominant Logic). Consider a firm with two businesses:
𝐵 , 𝐵 .
B = { : Consumer Electronics : Healthcare Products }
1 2
The firm’s Dominant Logic is described as follows:
• Schemas ( ): is a schema that responds to market trends by adjusting product pricing. For instance:
𝑆 .

Increase in demand Increase price by 10%
• Decision-making ( ): The firm allocates R&D resources to maximize revenue. For example:
, . ,
D ( Budget Share: 0.6 Capabilities: Advanced R&D ) = 0 8
indicating 80% of the R&D budget is allocated to Consumer Electronics.
• Knowledge Structure ( ): Nodes represent domain expertise such as ‘‘Electronics Design’’ and ‘‘Health-
care Regulation,’’ with directed edges denoting knowledge dependencies.
𝑃 𝑃 ,
• Performance Metrics ( P ): Metrics include = Revenue Growth and = Customer Retention mea-
1 2
sured as:

Through this Dominant Logic, the firm evaluates whether R&D investments optimize the metrics and ,
1 2
adapting to feedback from market performance.

Definition 3.62 (Strategic Fit). A Dominant Logic achieves strategic fit if, for each business 𝑖 , there
𝑆 ,
exists a schema
∈ S
and a decision
D (v c)
such that:
𝐵 𝑃 .
P ( ) ∈ P
is maximized for all
𝑗 𝑖 𝑗
D P
Example 3.63 (Strategic Fit). In the earlier example, the firm aligns with by prioritizing R&D spending
in Consumer Electronics, where revenue growth ( ) shows the highest marginal return per unit investment. If
𝐵 𝐵
the healthcare business ( ) exhibits diminishing returns, resources are reallocated to to maximize overall
2 1
firm performance.
Next, the following describes Dominant Neutrosophic Logic, which extends Dominant Logic using Neutro-
sophic Logic.
Definition 3.64 (Dominant Neutrosophic Logic). Dominant Neutrosophic Logic is an extension of Dominant
𝑇 𝐼 𝐹

The Dominant Neutrosophic Logic for can be described as follows:

trends:

( Positive market trend ) = ( = 0 8 = 0 15 = 0 05)
2. Neutrosophic Decision-making ( ): Allocates resources with uncertainty in mind. For example:

D ( R&D Budget: 60% Capabilities: AI Research ) = ( = 0 7 = 0 2 = 0 1)
3. Neutrosophic Knowledge Structure ( ): Nodes include ”Market Trends” and ”Technology Readiness,”

4. Neutrosophic Performance Metrics ( ): Metrics include revenue growth, evaluated as:

The neutrosophic framework helps the firm balance confidence ( ), uncertainty ( ), and risk ( ).
Theorem 3.67. Dominant Neutrosophic Logic naturally incorporates the structure of Neutrosophic Logic.
Proof. This follows directly from the definition of Dominant Neutrosophic Logic, as it extends the principles
(cid:131)
and framework of Neutrosophic Logic to dominant logical structures and reasoning processes.
Theorem 3.68. Dominant Neutrosophic Logic naturally incorporates the structure of Dominant Logic.
Proof. This follows directly from the definition of Dominant Neutrosophic Logic, as it integrates the funda-
(cid:131)
mental aspects of traditional Dominant Logic into a neutrosophic framework.
Theorem 3.69. Dominant Neutrosophic Logic is a superset of Fuzzy Dominant Logic.

Proof. Fuzzy Dominant Logic is a special case of Dominant Neutrosophic Logic where = 0 and = 0,
𝑇, 𝐼, 𝐹 𝑇, , 𝑇, 𝐼, 𝐹
reducing the neutrosophic value ( ) to ( 0 0) . Since Dominant Neutrosophic Logic allows to
, 𝑇 𝐼 𝐹
independently range within [0 1] under the constraint + + ≤ 1, Fuzzy Dominant Logic is fully embedded
(cid:131)
within this broader framework. Thus, Dominant Neutrosophic Logic generalizes Fuzzy Dominant Logic.
Theorem 3.70. Dominant Neutrosophic Logic accommodates multiple schemas, preserving independence and
interdependence among decision components.

Each schema operates independently as a mapping : E → A , where A = {( )} . Interde-

pendence is introduced through shared resources or dependencies represented in , a directed graph linking
knowledge nodes. This structure preserves independence at the schema level while modeling interdependen-

interdependent components.
Theorem 3.71. Dominant Neutrosophic Logic enhances decision-making by explicitly modeling uncertainty

Proof. In traditional Dominant Logic, decisions rely on deterministic or probabilistic values, lacking explicit
representation of indeterminacy or falsity. Dominant Neutrosophic Logic extends this framework by incor-

porating neutrosophic values , allowing decisions to account for truth, uncertainty, and conflict si-
multaneously. This enriched representation improves decision-making in complex scenarios with incomplete
or conflicting information, as each decision component evaluates strategic variables and organizational
(cid:131)
capabilities under neutrosophic uncertainty.
3.4.3 Service-Dominant Neutrosophic Logic
Service-Dominant Logic emphasizes value co-creation through service exchange, viewing goods as service
delivery mechanisms, focusing on relationships, collaboration, and customer-centricity in value creation [147,
215–219, 260, 317, 379–381].
Definition 3.72 (Service-Dominant Logic). (cf. [379, 380]) Service-Dominant Logic (S-D Logic) is a theo-
retical framework that conceptualizes value creation as a collaborative process among multiple actors within a
service ecosystem. Formally, it is defined as a tuple:

assigning a value to each interaction based on the integration of resources by the actors.
Example 3.73 (Service Ecosystem). Consider a healthcare service ecosystem:

• Institutional arrangements ( ) include healthcare regulations and insurance policies.
• Value cocreation processes ( ) evaluate outcomes such as patient health improvement or cost-effectiveness.
Through this framework, the ecosystem collectively cocreates value.

The neutrosophic constraints require that:

∈ [0 1] + + ≤ 1
Remark 3.75 (Neutrosophic Service-Dominant Logic). Fuzzy Service-Dominant Logic is a special case of
Neutrosophic Service-Dominant Logic where both indeterminacy and falsity are set to zero. Furthermore,
Plithogenic Service-Dominant Logic is notable for its ability to generalize both Neutrosophic and Fuzzy Service-
Dominant Logic.
Example 3.76 (Healthcare Service Ecosystem). A Healthcare Service Ecosystem is a dynamic network of
interconnected stakeholders collaboratively co-creating value through services, resources, and relationships to
improve health outcomes (cf. [4, 67, 399]). Consider a healthcare service ecosystem:
, , , .
A = { }

• Neutrosophic value cocreation processes ( ) evaluate outcomes such as patient health improvement.
For instance:

Through this framework, the ecosystem balances confidence ( ), uncertainty ( ), and risk ( ) in resource

Theorem 3.80. Service-Dominant Neutrosophic Logic enables dynamic optimization of resource exchanges
and value cocreation processes in complex ecosystems.

and conflicting information are prevalent.
3.4.4 Neutrosophic Critical Thinking (Neutrosophic Critical Logic)
Critical Thinking is the objective analysis and evaluation of information to form reasoned judgments, empha-
sizing logic, and evidence [35, 103, 170, 202, 243, 275].
Definition 3.81 (Critical Thinking). Critical thinking is the systematic, recursive, and logical process of ana-
lyzing, evaluating, and synthesizing information to derive coherent conclusions and self-reflectively improve
reasoning. Mathematically, it can be represented as:
𝑋 𝑋 ,
C( ) = R ◦ F ◦ E ◦ A ◦ I ( )
where:
1. I : X → R (Interpretation Function): A function that maps raw data ∈ X into a structured represen-

2. A : R → P (E) (Analysis Operator): A function that decomposes into its atomic elements or sub-

4. F : P (E) → C (Inference Function): A function that aggregates weighted elements {( ( ))} into

5. R : C → C (Self-Regulation Operator): A recursive function that reassesses and refines all preceding
(cid:48)
steps, resulting in an improved critical thinking process . Formally:

Remark 3.82. The critical thinking process is inherently recursive, as the self-regulation operator allows
iterative improvement. This ensures both logical rigor and adaptability to new information.
Example 3.83. Consider as a dataset of experimental observations supporting a scientific hypothesis. The
process proceeds as follows:

Definition 3.84 (Neutrosophic Critical Thinking). Neutrosophic Critical Thinking (NCT) is an extension of
classical critical thinking that operates under the framework of neutrosophic logic, incorporating degrees of
𝑇 𝐼 𝐹
truth ( ), indeterminacy ( ), and falsity ( ). This enables reasoning and decision-making in the presence of
uncertainty and contradictions. Formally, NCT is a structured process defined as:

Theorem 3.87. Neutrosophic Critical Thinking inherently extends classical critical thinking by modeling un-

certainty and contradiction through .
Proof. In classical critical thinking, each proposition is evaluated as either true or false, lacking an explicit

N ( ) = ( )
signing to each proposition , where:
𝑇, 𝐼, 𝐹 , , 𝑇 𝐼 𝐹 .

This representation allows propositions to simultaneously have degrees of truth ( ), indeterminacy ( ), and

Theorem 3.88. Neutrosophic Critical Thinking improves decision-making by balancing confidence, uncer-

Theorem 3.89. Neutrosophic Critical Thinking provides a self-regulating mechanism for iterative reasoning

Proof. The self-regulation operator in Neutrosophic Critical Thinking re-evaluates and refines conclusions
by incorporating new data or updated assumptions:

This recursive process ensures that decisions and conclusions remain adaptive to evolving information, im-
proving robustness and accuracy over time. Such iterative refinement is absent in classical critical thinking,

highlighting the advanced capabilities of the neutrosophic approach.
Theorem 3.90. Neutrosophic Critical Thinking is applicable to systems with incomplete or conflicting data,

3.4.5 Neutrosophic Climate Change Logic
In social science, Climate Change Logic models the interplay between human behavior, policies, and environ-
mental impacts, analyzing strategies to mitigate climate change while accounting for societal, economic, and

economic damage) occurring at state .

𝑎 𝑠
the state transition induced by activity from state .

neutrosophic framework, the state transition function and valuation function are extended as follows:

Results.
𝑎 𝐼
• (renewable energy) achieves the largest emission reduction probability (70%), reducing significantly,
but incurs higher upfront costs.
• (forest regeneration) provides a lower reduction probability (60%) but is more cost-effective.
• (no intervention) results in the highest regulatory penalties and climate impact, making it the least
optimal choice.
Thus, policymakers must evaluate trade-offs between emission reductions and associated costs to determine
the optimal climate mitigation policy.

Theorem 3.103. The neutrosophic popularity function in SMNL balances truth, indeterminacy, and

𝑐 𝑐 𝑐 𝑐 𝑐 𝑐 𝑐 𝑐 𝑐
This representation balances:

Theorem 3.104. SMNL explicitly models uncertainty and conflict in social media interactions through neu-

For each edge , the neutrosophic value represents:
• : The degree to which the interaction is meaningful or reliable.
• : The degree of uncertainty or ambiguity in the interaction.
• : The degree to which the interaction is misleading or false.
N ( )
By modeling interactions with , SMNL captures the uncertainty and conflict inherent in social media
(cid:131)
interactions, enabling a more accurate analysis of network dynamics.
Theorem 3.105. SMNL enhances decision-making by integrating neutrosophic evaluations into the programma-
bility component .
Proof. In SMNL, the programmability function is defined as:

where is the set of users, is the set of algorithms, is the set of platform responses, and is the updated

interactions or algorithm behavior, enables algorithms to:
• Prioritize responses with high (truthfulness).
• Mitigate decisions with high (uncertainty).
• Avoid actions with high (falsity).
This integration ensures that platform decisions are robust and adaptive to uncertainty and conflicting informa-

4 Future Tasks: Various Extensions
This section provides a brief overview of the future prospects of this research.
It is important to note that the concepts defined in this Future Tasks section are merely examples and hold
significant potential for improvement depending on the objectives and perspectives involved. However, by
engaging in such mathematical modeling, we believe that these concepts can be analyzed using various existing
mathematical frameworks and logics.
Further exploration of these definitions, their applications, and related research developments are expected to
progress in the future.
4.1 Real-World Applications within a New Social Framework
In this subsection, we discuss potential real-world applications within an uncertain social framework.
4.1.1 Plithogenic Social Framework
As previously mentioned, the plithogenic set is widely recognized for its flexibility and its ability to general-
ize Fuzzy Sets and Neutrosophic Sets [20, 304, 314, 325–327, 341, 352]. Owing to its versatile structure, the
plithogenic set holds significant potential for real-world applications. In this study, we propose extending the
plithogenic set framework to established methodologies such as Neutrosophic Psychology, PDCA, DMAIC,
SWOT, and OODA. By integrating plithogenic sets into these frameworks, our aim is to explore their inter-
connections and enhance their capability to address complex, multi-dimensional, and contradictory scenarios
effectively.
Below, we outline conceptual definitions for applying plithogenic sets to these systems:
• Plithogenic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity: A framework capturing multi-attribute dynamics in psycho-
logical and spiritual contexts, enabling nuanced assessments of human decision-making and well-being.
• Plithogenic PDCA: An extension of the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle that incorporates multi-criteria and
contradictory attributes for more effective quality improvement and problem-solving.
• Plithogenic DMAIC: A generalized approach to Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control, leveraging
plithogenic attributes to address complex operational challenges in Six Sigma processes.
• Plithogenic SWOT: An enriched version of Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats analysis, inte-
grating multi-dimensional perspectives and contradictions for strategic decision-making.
• Plithogenic OODA: A plithogenic adaptation of the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act loop, enabling flexible
and adaptive responses in dynamic and uncertain environments.
• Plithogenic Five Forces: An extension of Porter’s Five Forces framework, incorporating multi-attribute
and contradictory factors to analyze industry competition with greater flexibility and precision.
Theorem 4.1 (Generalization of Fuzzy and Neutrosophic Concepts in Plithogenic Frameworks). The frame-
works of Plithogenic Body-Mind-Soul-Spirit Fluidity, Plithogenic PDCA, Plithogenic DMAIC, Plithogenic
SWOT, Plithogenic OODA, and Plithogenic Five Forces extend the Fuzzy and Neutrosophic concepts by in-
tegrating multi-attribute, multi-criteria, and contradictory characteristics. These generalizations facilitate the
modeling and analysis of complex, multi-dimensional, and dynamic systems.
Proof. The claim is evident from the definitions of the Plithogenic frameworks. Similar proofs have been
provided in the literature [119, 125, 129]. Readers may refer to these works for detailed justifications if needed.
(cid:131)
By applying plithogenic sets to these widely used frameworks, we hope to provide more robust tools for
decision-making, strategic planning, and continuous improvement in diverse real-world contexts.
4.1.2 Hyperanalysis and Hypercycle
We also hope that concepts such as Hyperanalysis/Hypercycle and Superhyperanalysis/SuperHypercycle, which
hierarchically represent the ideas presented in this paper, will be explored as needed. These approaches are
envisioned as applications of hyperstructure [41,51] and superhyperstructure [117,118,121,122,154,331,334]
principles to the concepts introduced in this study.
First, we provide the definitions related to hyperstructure and superhyperstructure below. In set theory, hyper-
structure and superhyperstructure can be viewed as the power set and nth-superhyperset, respectively. Intu-
itively, they represent iterative structures. For detailed definitions of Hyperstructure and Superhyperstructure,
readers are encouraged to refer to relevant works such as [122, 318, 335] as needed.
𝑆 𝑆 𝑆
P ( )
Definition 4.2 (Powerset). [118] The powerset of a set , denoted by , is the set of all subsets of ,
including both the empty set and itself. Formally:
𝑆 𝐴 𝐴 𝑆 .
P ( ) = { | ⊆ }
Definition 4.3 (Hyperoperation). (cf. [294, 386–388]) A hyperoperation is an extension of a traditional binary
operation where the result of applying the operation to two elements is a subset of the base set rather than a
single element. Formally, given a set , a hyperoperation is defined as:
𝑆 𝑆 𝑆 ,
◦ : × → P ( )
𝑆 𝑆
P ( )
where is the powerset of .
Definition 4.4 (Hyperstructure). (cf. [118, 318, 335]) A Hyperstructure is a mathematical construct that gen-
eralizes operations on a set using its powerset. Formally, it is defined as:
𝑆 , ,
H = (P ( ) ◦)
where:
• is the underlying base set.
𝑆 𝑆 𝑆
P ( )
• denotes the powerset of , which includes all subsets of .
◦ P ( )
• is an operation acting on the elements of .
𝑛 𝑛 𝐻 𝐻
P ( )
Definition 4.5 ( -th Powerset). (cf. [118, 318, 335]) The -th powerset of a set , denoted as 𝑛 , is con-
structed recursively through successive powerset operations. Specifically:
𝐻 𝐻 , 𝐻 𝐻 𝑛 .
P ( ) = P ( ) P ( ) = P (P ( )) for ≥ 1
𝑛 𝑛
1 +1
𝑛 ∗ 𝐻
P ( )
Similarly, the -th non-empty powerset, denoted as , excludes the empty set at each level and is defined
as:
∗ 𝐻 ∗ 𝐻 , ∗ 𝐻 ∗ ∗ 𝐻 ,
P ( ) = P ( ) P ( ) = P (P ( ))
𝑛 𝑛
1 +1
∗ 𝐻 𝐻
P ( ) P ( )
where represents the standard powerset with the empty set removed.
𝐻 𝐻
P ( )
Definition 4.6 (SuperHyperOperations). (cf. [335]) Let be a non-empty set, and let represent the
𝐻 𝑛 𝑛 𝐻
P ( )
powerset of . The -th powerset, denoted as , is recursively defined as:
𝑘 𝑘
0 𝐻 𝐻, +1 𝐻 𝐻 , 𝑘 .
P ( ) = P ( ) = P (P ( )) ∀ ≥ 0
𝑚, 𝑛 𝑚
( )
A SuperHyperOperation of order is an -ary operation expressed as:
𝑚,𝑛 𝑚 𝑛
( ) 𝐻 𝐻 ,
◦ : → P ( )
𝑛 𝐻 𝑛 𝐻
P ( )
where denotes the -th powerset of , with two variations depending on inclusion or exclusion of the
empty set:
𝑚, 𝑛
( )
• If the codomain excludes the empty set, the operation is referred to as a classical-type -SuperHyperOperation.
𝑚, 𝑛
( )
• If the codomain includes the empty set, it is termed a Neutrosophic -SuperHyperOperation.
These SuperHyperOperations generalize hyperoperations to higher-order structures, accommodating multi-
layered relationships through iterative powerset constructions.
𝑛 𝑛
Definition 4.7 ( -Superhyperstructure). (cf. [318,335]) An -Superhyperstructure is an advanced extension of
a hyperstructure that incorporates -fold iterations of the powerset operation. It is defined as:
𝑆 , ,
SH = (P ( ) ◦)
𝑛 𝑛
where:
• is the base set.
𝑆 𝑛 𝑆
P ( )
• represents the -th powerset of , obtained through recursive applications of the powerset opera-
tion.
◦ P ( )
• is an operation defined on elements of .
The aforementioned concepts of hyperstructure and superhyperstructure can be applied not only to various
mathematical frameworks but also to concepts beyond pure mathematics. Consequently, it is natural to consider
their applicability to the ideas presented in this paper. For instance, the definitions of the PDCA Hypercycle
and PDCA n-SuperhyperCycle are provided above. We anticipate further exploration of these frameworks and
their potential applications to other models.
Definition 4.8 (PDCA Hypercycle). A PDCA Hypercycle is defined as:
𝑆 , ,
H = (P ( ) ◦)
𝑃𝐷𝐶 𝐴
where is a set of system states, and maps:
𝑋 𝐴 𝐶 𝐷 𝑃 𝑋 , 𝑋 𝑆.
H ( ) = ( ( ( ( )))) ⊆
𝑃𝐷𝐶 𝐴
Example 4.9 (PDCA Hypercycle in Quality Management). Consider a manufacturing process aimed at im-
proving product quality using the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) Hypercycle framework. The process can be
described as follows:
𝑆 𝑠 , 𝑠 , . . . , 𝑠 𝑠
= { }
• : A set of system states, where each represents a different stage of product quality,
1 2 5
such as:
𝑠 , 𝑠 , 𝑠 , 𝑠 , 𝑠 .

𝑋 𝑠 , 𝑠 , 𝑋 𝑠 , 𝑠 , 𝑠 , 𝑠 .
= { } P ( ) = {{ } { } { }}
2 3 2 3 2 3
• The PDCA Hypercycle operates through the following steps:
𝑃 𝑋
( )
1. : Plan phase – Define quality objectives and prepare production plans for the subset of states
𝑋 𝑠 , 𝑠
= { }
. For example, improving the defect rate by optimizing production parameters.
2 3
𝐷 𝑋
( )
2. : Do phase – Implement the plans, such as testing new production methods or upgrading
𝑠 𝑠
machinery in states and .
2 3
𝐶 𝑋
( )
3. : Check phase – Evaluate the outcomes of the Do phase by inspecting the quality results and
collecting metrics, such as:
Defect rate reduced from 5% to 3%
𝐴 𝑋
( )
4. : Act phase – Adjust processes based on the Check phase results. For instance, fine-tune the
machine settings further or update training protocols for workers.
The PDCA Hypercycle iteratively refines , evolving system states through higher-order feedback loops. The
process can be expressed mathematically as:
𝑋 𝐴 𝐶 𝐷 𝑃 𝑋 .
H ( ) = ( ( ( ( ))))
𝑃𝐷𝐶 𝐴
Outcome. After multiple iterations of the PDCA Hypercycle, the system achieves an improved state with a
defect rate of 1%, meeting the quality target.
𝑛 𝑛
Definition 4.10 (PDCA -SuperhyperCycle). A PDCA -SuperhyperCycle is defined as:
𝑛 𝑛 ,𝑛
𝑆 , (4 ) ,
SH = (P ( ) ◦ )
𝑃𝐷𝐶 𝐴
𝑛 𝑆 𝑛 𝑆
P ( )
where is the -th powerset of , and:
𝑛 𝑛 𝑛 𝑛 𝑛 𝑛
𝑋 𝐴 𝐶 𝐷 𝑃 𝑋 , 𝑋 𝑆 .
SH ( ) = ◦ ◦ ◦ ( ) ∈ P ( )
𝑃𝐷𝐶 𝐴
Example 4.11 (PDCA -SuperhyperCycle in Project Management). In a complex project management sce-
nario:
𝑆 𝑇 , 𝑇 , . . . , 𝑇
{ }
• : Tasks .
1 2 5
P2( 𝑆 )
• : Powerset of subsets of tasks, capturing interdependent subtasks and their groupings.
The PDCA 2-SuperhyperCycle proceeds as follows:
𝑃2( 𝑋
1. : Generates plans across grouped subtasks. For example:
𝑃2 𝑋 𝑇 , 𝑇 , 𝑇 , 𝑇 .
( ) = {{ } { }}
1 2 3 4
𝐷2( 𝑋
2. : Executes actions on these subsets, producing partial results.
𝐶2( 𝑋
3. : Evaluates subset outcomes, such as task completion percentages.
𝐴2( 𝑋
4. : Adjusts task groupings and priorities based on evaluation.
The process evolves iteratively through multi-level refinement, achieving higher-order optimization.
For clarification, as with the PDCA Hypercycle and n-SuperhyperCycle, the following concepts are defined.
We look forward to further research and advancements in these areas.
• DMAIC Hypercycle: A generalized approach to Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control, leveraging
hyperstructure attributes to address complex operational challenges within Six Sigma processes.
• SWOT Hyperanalysis: An enhanced version of the Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats anal-
ysis, integrating multi-dimensional perspectives and interdependencies to improve strategic decision-
making.
• OODA Hypercycle: A hyperstructure-based adaptation of the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act loop, enabling
flexible and adaptive responses in dynamic and uncertain environments.
• Five Forces Hyperanalysis: An extended version of Porter’s Five Forces framework, incorporating multi-
attribute and interdependent factors to analyze industry competition with greater precision and adaptabil-
ity.

process, addressing -fold complexities through multi-level operational analysis.
𝑛 𝑛
• SWOT -Superhyperanalysis: A multi-level enhancement of SWOT analysis, incorporating -fold di-
mensions and contradictions to enable comprehensive strategic planning and decision-making.
• OODA -Superhypercycle: A higher-order adaptation of the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act loop, capturing
-fold interdependencies to support adaptive and resilient decision-making in uncertain environments.
• Five Forces -Superhyperanalysis: An advanced extension of Porter’s Five Forces model, integrating
-fold multi-attribute and hierarchical structures to analyze industry competition with greater depth and
flexibility.
4.1.3 Other Frameworks
In addition to the frameworks discussed in this paper, numerous others are developed daily across various fields.
For example:
• COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies) [172, 273],
• BADIR (Business Question, Analysis Plan, Data Collection, Insights Derivation, Recommendations)
[175],
• ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) [135, 227],
• Five Whys [39, 303, 353],
• Kanban [5, 365],
• VRIO (Value, Rarity, Imitability, Organization) [192, 235],
• OGSM (Objectives, Goals, Strategies, and Measures) [213, 246, 274],
• PEST Analysis [78, 106, 220].
We hope to explore the potential for extending these frameworks using concepts such as Neutrosophic Struc-
tures, Uncertain Structures, and Superhyperstructures. Future research may focus on examining the mathemat-
ical structures of these extended frameworks and exploring their applications in fields such as social sciences.
4.2 New Strategic Leadership
4.2.1 Neutrosophic Strategic Leadership
In addition to the concepts discussed in this paper, the neutrosophic framework can be applied to a variety of
other fields and ideas. As an example, we introduce the concept of Neutrosophic Strategic Leadership.
Leadership refers to the ability to influence, guide, and inspire individuals or groups to achieve objectives
through effective communication, motivation, and vision [40, 57]. Strategic Leadership, in particular, focuses
on balancing short-term goals with long-term vision, emphasizing resource allocation, adaptability, and orga-
nizational alignment to ensure sustained success [108, 109, 384].
The related definitions and formalizations are presented below. It is important to note that leadership itself is
a multifaceted concept that can be defined and studied from various perspectives, depending on the context or
scope of analysis. The definitions provided here represent only one example among many.
We hope that future research will further explore concepts like Neutrosophic Strategic Leadership and its appli-
cations. Additionally, many related leadership frameworks have been studied extensively in existing literature,
including examples such as servant leadership [299], meta-leadership [95,225,226], e-leadership [29,84,184],
Agile leadership [28, 181], and followership [36, 370], among others.
Definition 4.12 (Classic Leadership). Classic Leadership is a structured decision-making framework that for-
malizes the process of directing, influencing, and coordinating individuals or groups to achieve organizational
goals. It is mathematically defined as a tuple:

1 2
mance metric is a mapping:

Remark 4.13 (Components of Classic Leadership). Classic Leadership focuses on task execution and organi-
zational performance by:
A T
• Aligning agents ( ) with appropriate tasks ( ) using their capabilities.
• Optimizing resource allocation ( ) under constraints.
• Selecting strategies ( ) to achieve goals efficiently.
• Evaluating performance ( ) based on measurable outcomes.
Example 4.14 (Classic Leadership in a Project Management Scenario). Consider a project with three agents,
two tasks, and finite resources:

The performance metrics evaluate success:
𝑃 𝑇 , 𝑃 𝑇 .

This example demonstrates how Classic Leadership optimizes task execution and resource utilization.
The concept of Neutrosophic Leadership, which integrates the principles of Neutrosophic Logic into the above
definition of leadership, is presented below.

leadership under uncertainty, ambiguity, and contradiction by extending classical leadership principles with

Remark 4.16 (Characteristics of Neutrosophic Leadership). Neutrosophic Leadership extends classical lead-
ership by:
• Incorporating truth, indeterminacy, and falsity components into agents, resources, tasks, and strategies.
• Managing ambiguity and uncertainty in decision-making.
• Balancing resource allocation and performance evaluations under incomplete information.
Remark 4.17 (Neutrosophic Leadership). Fuzzy Leadership is a special case of Neutrosophic Leadership
where both indeterminacy and falsity are set to zero. Furthermore, Plithogenic Leadership is notable for its
ability to generalize both Neutrosophic and Fuzzy Leadership.
Example 4.18 (Neutrosophic Leadership in a Construction Project). Consider a construction project with three
agents, two tasks, and limited resources:
𝐴 , 𝐴 , 𝐴 .
A = { : Leader : Engineer : Worker }
1 2 3
The resources and tasks are as follows:

The leader evaluates the strategy as:

This example demonstrates how neutrosophic leadership handles uncertainty and evaluates performance with
truth, indeterminacy, and falsity components.
Theorem 4.19. Neutrosophic Leadership generalizes Classical Leadership by incorporating uncertainty, in-
determinacy, and falsity into all components of leadership.
Proof. By definition, Classical Leadership uses precise values for agents, resources, and tasks. In Neutrosophic
𝑇, 𝐼, 𝐹 𝑇 𝐼 𝐹
Leadership, these components are extended to include neutrosophic evaluations ( ) . Since + + ≤ 1,
Neutrosophic Leadership preserves the classical framework while accommodating uncertainty and contradic-
𝐼 𝐹 (cid:131)
tion. Hence, Classical Leadership is a special case of Neutrosophic Leadership when = 0 and = 0.
Theorem 4.20. Neutrosophic Leadership improves decision-making under uncertainty compared to Classical
Leadership.
Proof. In Classical Leadership, decisions are based solely on precise values. In Neutrosophic Leadership,
𝐼 𝐹 𝑆𝑁
decisions incorporate uncertainty ( ) and falsity ( ) to provide a more robust evaluation. For any strategy ,
the neutrosophic evaluation:
𝑆 𝑇 , 𝐼 , 𝐹 ,
N ( ) = ( )
𝑆 𝑆 𝑆
𝐼 𝐹
allows leaders to account for ambiguity and risk. By assigning weights to and , decisions reflect a realistic

Next, the definition of Strategic Leadership is provided below.

and organizational guidance, balancing short-term and long-term goals through resource allocation, environ-
mental analysis, and stakeholder alignment. Formally, it is defined as a tuple:

Remark 4.23 (The differences between Strategic Leadership and Classical Leadership ). The differences be-
tween Strategic Leadership and Classical Leadership are summarized as follows:
1. Focus and Goals:
• Classical Leadership: Task-oriented, focusing on short-term objectives and immediate resource
utilization.
• Strategic Leadership: Balances short-term goals and long-term visions by aligning resources and
strategies for sustainability.
2. Decision-Making Framework:
• Classical Leadership: Uses predefined roles and strategies for decision-making.
• Strategic Leadership: Incorporates flexibility by dynamically adapting to external conditions.
3. Resource Management:
• Classical Leadership: Focuses on resource allocation for immediate task execution.
• Strategic Leadership: Dynamically allocates resources to achieve broader, long-term organizational
goals.
4. Environmental Adaptability:
• Classical Leadership: Assumes a static environment with limited external influence.
• Strategic Leadership: Explicitly models external conditions ( ) and adapts to changing environ-
ments.
5. Evaluation:
• Classical Leadership: Evaluates performance using task-specific metrics ( ).
• Strategic Leadership: Measures success using broader, vision-oriented metrics ( ).
Example 4.24 (Strategic Leadership in Renewable Energy Development). Consider a renewable energy com-
pany aiming to expand its operations by balancing short-term profitability with long-term sustainability. The
components of Strategic Leadership are instantiated as follows:

This framework ensures the company achieves its objectives while remaining responsive to market and envi-

We extend the above framework using Neutrosophic Sets to introduce Neutrosophic Strategic Leadership. The
following outlines this concept. We anticipate that further research and validation of this approach will progress
in the future.
Definition 4.25 (Neutrosophic Strategic Leadership). Neutrosophic Strategic Leadership (NSL) extends clas-
sical Strategic Leadership by incorporating uncertainty, indeterminacy, and falsity into the decision-making
process. It is defined as:

Remark 4.26 (Neutrosophic Strategic Leadership). Fuzzy Strategic Leadership is a special case of Neutro-
sophic Strategic Leadership where both indeterminacy and falsity are set to zero. Furthermore, Plithogenic
Strategic Leadership is notable for its ability to generalize both Neutrosophic and Fuzzy Strategic Leadership.
Example 4.27 (Application in Corporate Sustainability). A company evaluates its sustainability strategy (cf.
[132, 161, 389]) under uncertain environmental regulations:
• : The objective ”achieve 50% renewable energy usage by 2030” is represented as:

The framework ensures robust decision-making by balancing , , and across all components.
4.2.2 HyperLeadership
Furthermore, we anticipate future advancements in the research on the applications and validity of HyperLead-
ership and n-SuperhyperLeadership, which extend the principles of hyperstructure and superhyperstructure to
leadership. Although these ideas remain at the conceptual stage, the definitions are outlined below. As previ-
ously mentioned, for detailed definitions of Hyperstructure and Superhyperstructure, readers are encouraged to
consult relevant works such as [119, 122, 318, 335] as needed.
Definition 4.28 (HyperLeadership). HyperLeadership is an extended leadership framework that operates on
the powerset of agents, tasks, and resources, capturing hierarchical, multi-level, and interdependent leadership
dynamics. It is formally defined as a tuple:
, , , , ,
H = (P (A) P (T ) P (R) P (S) P (P))
𝐻𝐿
where:
P (A)
1. : The powerset of agents, including individual agents and their groupings:
𝐴, 𝐴(cid:48) 𝐴 .
P (A) = { ⊆ A | ≠ ∅}
P (T )
2. : The powerset of tasks, capturing interdependencies between tasks:
𝑇, 𝑇(cid:48) 𝑇 .
P (T ) = { ⊆ T | ≠ ∅}
P (R)
3. : The powerset of resources, representing combinations and allocations:
𝑅, 𝑅(cid:48) 𝑅 .
P (R) = { ⊆ R | ≠ ∅}
P (S)
4. : The powerset of strategies, where each strategy subset assigns resources and agents to task subsets:
𝑆 .
: P (A) × P (R) → P (T )
P (P)
5. : The powerset of performance metrics, evaluating leadership effectiveness at various levels:
𝑃 R.
: P (T ) →
Remark 4.29. HyperLeadership extends Classic Leadership by incorporating higher-order interactions among
agents, tasks, and resources. It enables hierarchical grouping and complex interrelations across organizational
levels.
𝑛 𝑛
Definition 4.30 ( -SuperhyperLeadership). -SuperhyperLeadership is a higher-order generalization of Hy-
perLeadership achieved through -fold applications of the powerset operation. It is formally defined as:
𝑛 𝑛 𝑛 𝑛 𝑛
, , , , ,
SH L = (P (A) P (T ) P (R) P (S) P (P))
where:
𝑛 𝑛
P (A)
1. : The -th powerset of agents, recursively defined as:
𝑘 𝑘
0 , +1 , 𝑘 .
P (A) = A P (A) = P (P (A)) ≥ 0

2. : The -th powerset of tasks, capturing multi-layered task hierarchies:

3. : The -th powerset of resources, describing higher-order combinations and allocations:

4. : The -th powerset of strategies, mapping higher-order subsets of agents and resources to task

5. : The -th powerset of performance metrics, evaluating leadership effectiveness at multi-level
task structures:
𝑃 R.
: P (T ) →
Remark 4.31. -SuperhyperLeadership provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing and managing
leadership dynamics across multiple organizational layers, accounting for interdependencies, feedback loops,
and iterative refinements.
Example 4.32 (HyperLeadership in Multi-Team Project Management). Consider a project with three teams of
A T R
agents ( ), six tasks ( ), and three types of resources ( ):
, , , 𝑇 , 𝑇 , . . . , 𝑇 , 𝑅 , 𝑅 , 𝑅 .
A = { } T = { } R = { }
Team 1 Team 2 Team 3
1 2 6 1 2 3
• HyperLeadership generates subsets of agents, tasks, and resources:
, , . . . .
P (A) = {{ } { } }
Team 1 Team 2, Team 3
• A strategy maps teams and resources to tasks:
𝑆 , 𝑅 , 𝑅 𝑇 , 𝑇 , 𝑇 .
({ } { }) → { }
Team 1, Team 2
1 2 1 3 4
• Performance metrics evaluate task outcomes:
𝑃 𝑇 , 𝑇 , 𝑇 .

This example illustrates the role of HyperLeadership in managing interdependent teams, tasks, and resources.
4.3 New Negotiation Theory
4.3.1 Neutrosophic Negotiation Theory
Negotiation Theory is the study of strategies and processes that parties use to reach agreements, focusing on
balancing interests, alternatives, and outcomes [3, 96, 361, 394, 395]. In Negotiation Theory, the frameworks
of BATNA and ZOPA are well known. BATNA refers to the best outcome a party can achieve if negotiations
fail, serving as their most advantageous alternative or fallback option [50,73,228,293,301]. ZOPA is the range
of possible agreements where both parties’ outcomes overlap, enabling a mutually beneficial deal; outside this
range, no rational agreement can be reached [185, 212, 238, 401].
Definition 4.33 (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA)). Let represent a negotiation between
𝐴 𝐵
D ⊆
R2
two parties, (Agent 1) and (Agent 2), where the set of all possible deals is .
The Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA) for each party is the utility associated with their best
achievable outcome if no agreement is reached. Formally:
𝑈 𝛼 , 𝑖 𝐴, 𝐵 ,
BATNA = max ( ) ∈ { }
𝑖 𝑖
∈A
where:
𝑖 𝑁
• : The set of alternatives available to party outside the current negotiation (e.g., other partners,
fallback options).
𝑈 R 𝑖
• : A → : The utility function of party , representing their valuation for each alternative outcome.
𝑖 𝑖
• BATNA : The maximum utility value party can achieve independently of the current negotiation.
Interpretation. The BATNA represents the threshold utility for each party to accept any negotiated deal
𝑑 𝑖 𝑑
∈ D
. Specifically, party will accept a deal only if:
𝑈 𝑑 .
( ) ≥
BATNA
𝑖 𝑖
Definition 4.34 (Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA)). The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA) is the set of
feasible deals where both parties’ utilities meet or exceed their respective BATNAs.
𝑈 R 𝑈 R 𝐴 𝐵
Let : D → and : D → represent the utility functions of parties and , respectively. Then the
𝐴 𝐵
ZOPA is defined as:
𝑑 𝑈 𝑑 𝑈 𝑑 ,
= { ∈ D | ( ) ≥ ( ) ≥ }
ZOPA BATNA and BATNA
𝐴 𝐴 𝐵 𝐵
where:
D ⊆
R2 𝑑

𝑑 , 𝑑
𝑑 𝑑
• : The set of all possible deals , where and represent the utilities for parties
𝐴 𝐵 𝐴 𝐵

• and : The utilities for parties and when deal is agreed upon.
𝐴 𝐵
𝐴 𝐵
• BATNA and BATNA : The BATNAs for parties and , as defined earlier.
𝐴 𝐵
∈ D
Conditions for ZOPA Existence. The ZOPA exists if and only if there exists a deal such that:
𝑈 𝑑 𝑈 𝑑 .
( ) ≥ ( ) ≥
BATNA and BATNA
𝐴 𝐴 𝐵 𝐵
The conditions for the existence of a ZOPA can be expressed as:
𝑈 𝑑 𝑈 𝑑 .
max ( ) ≥ BATNA and max ( ) ≥ BATNA
𝐴 𝐴 𝐵 𝐵
𝑑 𝑑
∈ D ∈ D
∈ D
Negative Bargaining Zone. If no such exists where both conditions hold, then the ZOPA does not
exist, and the negotiation is said to have a Negative Bargaining Zone (NBZ).
𝐴 𝐵
Example 4.35 (ZOPA in Practice). Suppose two parties and negotiate over the price of a car. Let:
, , .
BATNA = 5 000 and BATNA = 4 500
𝐴 𝐵
𝑑 𝑑 , , ,
The possible deals (prices) are represented by ∈ D = [4 000 6 000] , where:
𝑈 𝑑 , 𝑑 𝑈 𝑑 𝑑 , .
( ) = 6 000 − and ( ) = − 4 000
𝐴 𝐵
The ZOPA is the set of prices where both utilities exceed their BATNAs:
, 𝑑 , 𝑑 , , .
6 000 − ≥ 5 000 and − 4 000 ≥ 4 500
Simplifying these conditions gives:
𝑑 , 𝑑 , .
≤ 5 000 and ≥ 4 500
Therefore, the ZOPA is:
, , , .
ZOPA = [4 500 5 000]
The above concepts are extended by incorporating the conditions of the Neutrosophic Set.
Definition 4.36 (Neutrosophic Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (Neutrosophic BATNA)). Let
𝐴 𝐵
represent a negotiation between two parties (Agent 1) and (Agent 2), where the set of all possible deals is
D ⊆

. The Neutrosophic Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement (Neutrosophic BATNA) incorporates
𝑇 𝐼 𝐹
the degrees of truth ( ), indeterminacy ( ), and falsity ( ) into the evaluation of alternatives.
𝑖 𝐴, 𝐵

Formally, the Neutrosophic BATNA for each party is defined as:

NBATNA = max N ( ) N ( ) = ( ( ) ( ) ( ))
𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖

Remark 4.37 (Neutrosophic BATNA). Fuzzy BATNA is a special case of Neutrosophic BATNA where both
indeterminacy and falsity are set to zero. Furthermore, Plithogenic BATNA is notable for its ability to generalize
both Neutrosophic and Fuzzy BATNA.

Proof. The result follows directly from the definition.
Theorem 4.39. The Neutrosophic BATNA exhibits the structure of a Classic BATNA.
(cid:131)
Proof. The result follows directly from the definition.
Definition 4.40 (Neutrosophic Zone of Possible Agreement (Neutrosophic ZOPA)). The Neutrosophic Zone
of Possible Agreement (Neutrosophic ZOPA) is the set of feasible deals where the neutrosophic utility of both
parties meets or exceeds their respective Neutrosophic BATNAs.
Let N : D → [0 , 1]3 and N : D → [0 , 1]3 represent the neutrosophic utility functions of parties 𝐴 and 𝐵 ,
𝐴 𝐵
respectively. Then the Neutrosophic ZOPA is defined as:
𝑑 𝑑 𝑑 .

NZOPA NBATNA and NBATNA
𝐴 𝐴 𝐵 𝐵

If no such deal exists, the negotiation is said to have a Neutrosophic Negative Bargaining Zone (NNBZ).
Remark 4.41 (Neutrosophic ZOPA). Fuzzy ZOPA is a special case of Neutrosophic ZOPA where both inde-
terminacy and falsity are set to zero. Furthermore, Plithogenic ZOPA is notable for its ability to generalize both
Neutrosophic and Fuzzy ZOPA.
𝐴 𝐵
Example 4.42 (Neutrosophic ZOPA in Practice). Suppose two parties and negotiate over a service fee.
Their Neutrosophic BATNAs are:
. , . , . , . , . , . .
NBATNA = (0 8 0 1 0 1) NBATNA = (0 7 0 2 0 1)
𝐴 𝐵
∈ D
The possible deals are represented by their Neutrosophic utility values:

N ( ) = ( ( ) ( ) ( )) N ( ) = ( ( ) ( ) ( ))
𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝐵 𝐵 𝐵 𝐵
For a deal to belong to the Neutrosophic ZOPA, the following conditions must hold:

Assume a deal has the following utilities:

4.4 New Framing
4.4.1 Neutrosophic Framing
Framing is the presentation of identical information in different ways, influencing decision-making behavior
by altering perception of outcomes and choices.
Definition 4.45 (Framing). Framing is a representation of a decision problem where the same problem is

Remark 4.46 (Impact of Framing). Framing influences , the valuation of outcomes, depending on how the
outcomes are presented. Specifically:
• A positive frame presents outcomes as gains, leading to risk-averse behavior.
• A negative frame presents outcomes as losses, leading to risk-seeking behavior.
𝐴 𝑂 𝑃 𝑉
Thus, the same , , and may yield different decisions due to changes in .
Example 4.47 (Framing Effect: Risk Preferences). Consider two equivalent frames for a medical treatment
decision:
• Positive Frame: ”200 lives will be saved.”
• Negative Frame: ”400 people will die.”
𝑂 𝑜 , 𝑜
= { }
The outcomes are identical, with:
1 2
𝑉 𝑜 , 𝑉 𝑜 .
( ) = ( ) =
200 lives saved 400 lives lost
1 2
Given the same probabilities , a decision-maker under the positive frame tends to be risk-averse, favoring a
certain outcome (e.g., saving 200 lives). Under the negative frame, the decision-maker becomes risk-seeking,
preferring uncertain options to avoid losses.

Remark 4.50 (Neutrosophic Valuation and Decision-Making). Neutrosophic framing allows for a richer eval-
uation of decision problems by incorporating:
• Positive outcomes ( ) that contribute directly to utility.
• Uncertain or ambiguous outcomes ( ), which reflect incomplete or unclear information.
• Negative outcomes ( ) that reflect losses or contradictions.
This framework can model real-world scenarios where outcomes are not purely true or false but lie within a
range of truth, uncertainty, and falsity.
Remark 4.51 (Neutrosophic framing). Fuzzy framing is a special case of Neutrosophic framing where both
indeterminacy and falsity are set to zero. Furthermore, Plithogenic framing is notable for its ability to generalize
both Neutrosophic and Fuzzy framing.

4.4.2 Hyperframing
Additionally, we introduce the concepts of Hyperframing and Superhyperframing, which incorporate hierar-
chical structures into traditional framing. While these concepts are currently at the conceptual stage, their
definitions are outlined below.
We hope that future research will explore and develop these frameworks further.
Definition 4.56 (Hyperframing). Hyperframing extends the classical framing concept into a hyperstructure
framework, allowing multi-level relationships between actions, outcomes, and utilities. A Hyperframe is
defined as:
𝐹 𝐴 , 𝑂 , 𝑃 , 𝑉 , 𝑈 ,
= (P ( ) P ( ) )
𝐻 𝐻 𝐻 𝐻
where:
𝐴 𝐴 𝑎 , 𝑎 , . . . , 𝑎
P ( ) = { }
• : The powerset of the set of available actions , representing multi-level or
1 2
grouped actions.
𝑂 𝑂 𝑜 , 𝑜 , . . . , 𝑜
P ( ) = { }
• : The powerset of the set of outcomes , representing interconnected or com-
1 2
bined outcomes.
𝑃 𝐴 𝑂 ,
• : P ( ) × P ( ) → [0 1] : The hyperprobability function, which assigns probabilities to outcomes
𝑋 𝑂 𝑌 𝐴

given hyper-actions , satisfying:
(cid:213)
𝑌 𝐴 , 𝑃 𝑋 𝑌 .
∀ ∈ P ( ) ( | ) = 1
𝑋 𝑂

𝑉 𝑂 R
• : P ( ) → : The hypervaluation function, which assigns numerical values to subsets of outcomes
𝑋 𝑂

𝑈 𝐴 R
• : P ( ) → : The hyperutility function, defined as:
(cid:213)
𝑈 𝑌 𝑃 𝑋 𝑌 𝑉 𝑋 , 𝑌 𝐴 .
( ) = ( | ) · ( ) ∈ P ( )
𝐻 𝐻 𝐻
𝑋 𝑂
∈ P ( )
𝑌 ∗ 𝐴
∈ P ( )
The decision-maker selects the hyper-action that maximizes the hyperutility:
𝑌 ∗ 𝑈 𝑌 .
= arg max ( )
𝑌 𝐴
∈ P ( )
Remark 4.57 (Hyperstructure in Hyperframing). Hyperframing incorporates multiple layers of choices and
outcomes, where actions and outcomes are represented as subsets rather than individual elements. This allows
for a more flexible and interconnected decision-making process.
Example 4.58 (Hyperframing in a Project Management Context). Consider a project with two main tasks
𝐴 𝑎 , 𝑎 𝑂 𝑜 , 𝑜
= { } = { }
and two outcomes . The hyperstructure allows grouping of actions and outcomes as
1 2 1 2
subsets:
𝐴 𝑎 , 𝑎 , 𝑎 , 𝑎 , 𝑂 𝑜 , 𝑜 , 𝑜 , 𝑜 .
P ( ) = {{ } { } { }} P ( ) = {{ } { } { }}

4.6 New Storytelling Definition
4.6.1 Neutrosophic Storytelling
Storytelling is the process of conveying information, values, or experiences through structured narratives, fos-
tering emotional engagement and facilitating knowledge transfer [47, 111, 169, 209, 276]. This concept is ex-
tended using Neutrosophic Logic, leading to the development of Neutrosophic Storytelling. The definitions
and associated concepts are provided below.

Definition 4.72 (Neutrosophic Storytelling). Neutrosophic Storytelling extends traditional storytelling by in-
tegrating neutrosophic logic into the narrative process, capturing uncertainty, indeterminacy, and falsity in
audience comprehension and value transmission. It is defined as a tuple:

Remark 4.73. Fuzzy Storytelling is a special case of Neutrosophic Storytelling where both indeterminacy
and falsity are set to zero. Furthermore, Plithogenic Storytelling is notable for its ability to generalize both
Neutrosophic and Fuzzy Storytelling.

4.6.3 Neutrosophic Work-Life Balance
Work-Life Balance refers to the effective management of time and energy between professional responsibilities

Definition 4.79 (Work-Life Balance). Work-Life Balance (WLB) is a mathematical framework that models the
allocation of time, resources, and energy between professional responsibilities (work) and personal priorities

indicating that the perceived utility, time allocation, and recovery are insufficient to offset work burdens.
Optimal Neutrosophic Work-Life Balance. The optimal neutrosophic balance maximizes overall neutro-
sophic utility while accounting for indeterminacy and falsity:

Remark 4.82 (Neutrosophic Work-Life Balance). Fuzzy Work-Life Balance is a special case of Neutrosophic
Work-Life Balance where both indeterminacy and falsity are set to zero. Furthermore, Plithogenic Work-Life
Balance is notable for its ability to generalize both Neutrosophic and Fuzzy Work-Life Balance.
Example 4.83 (Neutrosophic Work-Life Balance Scenario). A manager allocates their time as follows in a
24-hour day:

• Work activities: = { : emails : meetings } , with neutrosophic time ( ) = (0 8 0 1 0 1)

The recovery values and costs are:

If decreases to 0.5 (e.g., reduced sleep), recovery becomes insufficient, leading to imbalance:
