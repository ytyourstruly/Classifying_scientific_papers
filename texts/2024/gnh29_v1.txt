3. The Essence of Art
Art aligns with humanity's most profound mission on Earth: the quest for understanding the truth of existence. It
encompasses the interplay of art, mysticism, and religion. Within each individual lies a reservoir of perspectives,
talents, and vivid imaginings that yearn for expression. This intrinsic need drives the creation of all artistic works,
whether through poetry, painting, or other forms of creative expression (Shariati, 2000:63).
Islamic scholars have historically regarded art not merely as a practical invention but as an integral component of
wisdom, theoretical contemplation, and intuitive insight. In this context, religious art possesses both general and
Asian Institute of Research Journal of Social and Political Sciences Vol.7, No.4, 2024
specific meanings. Broadly, it is associated with virtues and the pursuit of perfection within Islamic culture. More
specifically, art manifests in various imaginative forms, embodying beauty and glory while engaging with
reflection, logic, and reality (Madadpour, 2008:231).
The journey of the artist, as facilitated by art, is fundamentally a spiritual odyssey that traverses the realms of
imagination and reality. Through this creative process, artists ascend to new heights of understanding and
expression, contributing to a deeper appreciation of the human experience.
4. Herat City
Herat is a province located in the northwest region of Afghanistan, recognized as one of the oldest cities in Central
Asia. The city is prominently referenced in ancient texts, including the Avesta, as well as other historical sources,
underscoring its long-standing significance. Renowned for its rich cultural heritage and educational advancements,
Herat has earned a reputation as a distinguished center of learning.
Throughout history, the presence of esteemed scholars and educators has contributed to the city’s esteemed image.
A multitude of intellectuals and scientists from various Islamic countries have historically journeyed to Herat to
pursue knowledge and education. This influx of scholars has fostered a vibrant cultural and religious atmosphere,
enhancing the city’s prosperity and intellectual brilliance (Khalili, 1989:14).
Herat's landscape, adorned with mosques, schools, and libraries, reflects its historical commitment to scholarship
and the arts. The city has achieved notable scientific honors, and its lush greenery further amplifies its reputation.
Firmly rooted in knowledge and rich in intellectual treasures, Herat continues to shine as a beacon of cultural and
educational excellence (Sharwa, 2013:5).
5. Khwaja Abdullah Ansari Heravi
Abu Ismail Khwaja Abdullah Ansari Heravi was a distinguished sheikh and mystic of the fourth and fifth centuries
AH. Born in 1006 in the castle of Kahendzh, located in Herat, he emerged as a prominent scholar who illuminated
the intellectual landscape of the region with his profound understanding of logic and Sufism (Rajabi, 2010:12).
Khwaja Abdullah was the son of Abu Mansur Ansari Heravi, who was also a Sufi and lived a life deeply rooted
in mysticism. Influenced by his father's spiritual practices, Khwaja Abdullah was guided from an early age to
embrace the principles of Sufism.
His childhood and adolescence were marked by notable achievements. He began his formal education at the age
of four and commenced reciting the Holy Quran by the age of seven. Following this, he delved into the study of
Arabic and Persian literature. By the age of fourteen, he had mastered a range of traditional sciences, including
Arabic literature, the science of interpretation (Tafsir), hadith studies, Hanbali jurisprudence, theology, and
philosophy. This extensive educational background set the foundation for his later contributions to Islamic thought
and mysticism (Farhadi, 1981:257).
6. Achievements of Khwaja Abdullah Ansari
One of the notable innovations of Khwaja Abdullah Ansari was his ability to intertwine poetry with prose, creating
a harmonious relationship between the two forms of expression. This synthesis allowed him to convey profound
spiritual and mystical insights in a manner that resonated deeply with his audience (Honarwar, 2011:12).
In Herat, literacy was widespread, and the educational institutions where Khwaja Abdullah studied provided a
robust foundation in both Arabic and Persian literature, facilitating his intellectual growth. His mystical discourses
are rich with literary subtleties and complex ideas, demonstrating an expansive understanding of mystical
concepts.
Asian Institute of Research Journal of Social and Political Sciences Vol.7, No.4, 2024
Khwaja Abdullah had a remarkable talent for articulating the nuances of the self, presenting various terms such as
egotism, self-portraiture, self-love, self-cultivation, and self-loathing with clarity and depth. His exploration of
these themes reflects his mastery of language and his commitment to addressing the intricacies of human
experience, showcasing the breadth of his literary and mystical contributions (Naseri, 1991:23).
7. Instructors of Khwaja Abdullah Ansari Heravi
Khwaja Abdullah Ansari was profoundly influenced by a number of esteemed teachers throughout his educational
journey. Among his most notable instructors were Khwaja Imam Yahya Ammar Shaibani, Sheikh Abu Abdullah
Taqi, Abu Bakr Haidari, Sheikh Abul Hasan Kharqani, Khwaja Ahmad Chishti, and Sheikh Abu Sayyid Abul
Khair. These scholars played a pivotal role in shaping his intellectual and spiritual development (Habibi Heravi,
2015:18).
In addition to these prominent figures, Khwaja Abdullah was also taught by other respected scholars, including
Qazi Abu Mansur Azdi, Abu Al-Hasan Bashari Sajzi, Taqi Sajistani, Jarahi, Bashani, and Abu Al-Hasan Ali Tarazi
(Farhadi, 1981:62).
8. Notable Works of Khwaja Abdullah Ansari
Khwaja Abdullah Ansari is renowned for his many valuable books, treatises, and writings, although some of these
works are scarce and difficult to obtain. His scholarly approach often includes citing a verse from the Holy Quran
at the beginning of each chapter, illustrating the harmony between Sharia (Islamic law), the spiritual path, and the
ultimate truth (Takestani, 1993:10).
One of his most notable contributions is Manazil al-Sa'irin, which is composed in both Arabic and Persian. This
work is regarded as one of the most significant texts in the realm of practical mysticism and has been taught in
religious seminaries for many years (Khalili, 1989:78).
Among his other important works are the extensive Kashf al-Asrar, which spans ten volumes, and Kanz al-Salkin.
Additionally, Khwaja Abdullah authored several other influential texts, including Zad al-Arifin, Munajat-e-
Nameh, Ilahi-Nameh, Dhim al-Kalam, Risalat Dil wa Jan, Risalat al-Waredat, and Qalandar-e-Nameh, all
produced over various years (Takestani, 1993:12).
Another celebrated work is Nafhat al-Ans, which was written in the local dialect of Herat. This text was later
translated into Persian by Khwaja Abdul Rahman Jami in the ninth century of the lunar calendar (Madadpour,
2008:20).
Many of these works have been published in various countries, including Egypt and France, as well as in the
Dominican Collection of Eastern and Western Studies, contributing to the preservation and dissemination of
Khwaja Abdullah's profound insights and teachings (Farhadi, 1981:277).
9. Late Life and Demise of Khwaja Abdullah Ansari
Throughout the eighty years of his life, Khwaja Abdullah Ansari devoted himself tirelessly to guiding his disciples
and educating his students. However, at the age of seventy-two, he experienced a decline in health that resulted in
blindness. Despite this challenge, he remained committed to his scholarly pursuits (Abbasi Delkani, 2019:21).
In the latter part of his life, Khwaja Abdullah aspired to complete his interpretation of the Holy Quran. He worked
diligently to provide insights into the text, often dictating to his students who transcribed his interpretations.
Unfortunately, he was unable to finish this monumental task before his passing.
Khwaja Abdullah Ansari died in 1098 at the age of eighty-five. Following his death, a large crowd from Herat
accompanied his body to the cemetery at Gazergah, where he was laid to rest. His grave has since become a site
Asian Institute of Research Journal of Social and Political Sciences Vol.7, No.4, 2024
Islamic mysticism and education (Farhadi, 1981:213).
10. Gazergah
Gazergah is situated on a mountainside to the north of Herat city and has been referred to by various names
throughout history. One such name, Gazer, translates to "laundry," reflecting the local tradition of washing clothes
in the area. Another name, Karzargah, is derived from the historical significance of the site, where many martyrs
were believed to have been buried in seven wells, thus designating it as a cemetery (Bahre, 2009:61).
Historical research indicates that Gazergah was established during the reign of the kings of Crete and underwent
significant development. The site was further enhanced with exquisite structures during the Timurid period,
leaving behind inscriptions and decorative elements that still adorn the area today (Farhadi, 1981:265).
Gazergah is the final resting place for many Sufis, mystics, and notable individuals, including Timurid princes.
Notably, Amir Dost Mohammad Khan, a prominent king of Afghanistan, is also buried here. Additionally, the
tomb of Khwaja Abdullah Ansari and his sons is located on the northern side of the Gazergah complex (Seddiqi,
1981:59).
The shrine possesses a sacred atmosphere and has been a focal point throughout the history of Herat, witnessing
major military and political events (Rajabi, 2010:12).
The Islamic architecture of Gazergah has ancient roots, featuring large palaces, ponds, and magnificent gardens,
showcasing the pinnacle of architectural achievements from earlier times (Khalili, 1989:56).
Notably, artifacts from the tenth century AD, along with valuable works from the Sassanid and Umayyad periods,
exhibit a unique blend of ancient artistic traditions and emerging Islamic architectural styles.
To fully appreciate the decorative arts at Gazergah, it is essential to evaluate the progression of each artistic
tradition utilized in this historic site (Abbasi Delkani, 2019:72).
The architectural and engineering feats of the Timurid monuments are often attributed to Master Qavam al-Din
Mimar ibn Zain al-Din, who is believed to have played a significant role in the construction of both the tombs and
the pilgrimage site at Gazergah. Master Qavam al-Din is renowned among architects, celebrated for his exceptional
works that continue to garner admiration and respect (Azhand, 2008:307).
11. Decorative Art of Illumination
The art of illumination has its origins in the early centuries of Islam, deeply rooted in the rich cultural and artistic
traditions of the vast Asian region. The absence of emphasis on portraiture, often due to religious prohibitions,
facilitated the development of this distinctive style of painting, known as decorative arts and illumination
(Honarwar, 2011:17).
As this art form evolved, it became associated with Islamic and Arab governance, eventually being recognized as
a key aspect of Islamic art. Illumination artists excelled in creating works that now grace museums around the
world, establishing illumination as a prominent and enduring art form (Takestani, 1993:26).
What renders this significant art so important is its application in conjunction with verses from the Holy Quran,
hadiths, scientific and cultural texts, poetry collections, as well as its presence in mosques and other sacred sites.
In the city of Herat, illumination has experienced remarkable growth and flourishing. From the Timurid period to
the present, the illumination of the Herat School has maintained a distinct and esteemed place in the artistic
landscape, earning recognition from historians and researchers both in the East and the West (Sarwatian, 1989:10).
Asian Institute of Research Journal of Social and Political Sciences Vol.7, No.4, 2024
A notable perspective within the discourse surrounding this art form is that illumination, along with its symbolic
representations, is considered one of the original Islamic arts. This viewpoint asserts that illumination has not faced
significant opposition within the Islamic world and has garnered approval from Islamic scholars, largely due to its
avoidance of depicting faces or representations of living beings. Thus, illumination continues to thrive as a revered
and accepted art form within Islamic culture (Madadpour, 2008:234).
11.1 Definition of Illumination
Illumination refers to the art of decorating texts with gold or golden hues, resulting in illuminated artworks that
feature ornate motifs, borders, and miniature illustrations. This technique enhances the visual appeal of the written
word, creating a harmonious blend of art and literature (Takestani, 1993:28).
11.2 Applications of Illumination
Illumination art has a wide range of applications across various contexts. These intricate designs have been
employed to adorn the walls of mosques, minarets, mihrabs, courtyards, and palaces. Additionally, illumination is
utilized in tiling, carving, and the engraving of silver and gold in sacred spaces. The enduring presence of this art
form continues to exemplify the artistic vision and finesse of its creators (Naseri, 1991:35).
11.3 Historical Course of Illumination
The historical trajectory of decorative arts, particularly illumination and miniature painting, can be traced through
several significant periods that followed the advent of Islam: Sassanid Period, Seljuk Period, Ilkhanate Period,
Timurid Period, Safavid Period, Qajar Period, Pahlavi Period
Each of these eras contributed to the evolution and refinement of illumination techniques and styles (Dastgiri,
1960:29).
Saeed Mashal Ghori Heravi. Following his efforts, the faculty members of the Fine Arts Department at Herat
University have continued to uphold the tradition of illumination art, fostering its growth and recognition in
contemporary times (Banwal, 1982:132).
11.4 Famous Illuminators of Herat
During the Timurid era, several skilled illuminators emerged from the Herat Miniature School, including Amir
Khalil Sayyid Mirak Naghash, Maulana Haj Muhammad Naghash, Maulana Yari, Maulana Mahmud, Muhammad
Hassan Kateb, and Khwaja Nasruddin Muhammad. Among them, Maulana Hedayi distinguished himself with
extraordinary skills in tile making and painting, often adorning his poetry with exquisite motifs and illuminations,
showcasing the rich artistic heritage of Herat (Rajabi, 2010:159).
11.5 Elements of Illumination
In his work Qanun al-Suwar, Sadeghi Bek Afshar identifies seven fundamental styles, referred to as "elements of
illumination." These are: Arabesque, Angelica, Cloudy, Waq, Niloofar, Farangi, Romie.
Among the decorative arts of the Timurid period, the traditional Arabesque style was particularly prominent and
held significant value as an illumination element. The intricate Arabesque designs, characterized by complex plant
motifs, were often combined with calligraphy and inscriptions. This fusion not only enhanced the visual appeal
but also established a sense of balance and symmetry within the compositions, resulting in a harmonious and
captivating beauty in the illuminated works (Azhand, 2009:53).

12. Discussion
In this section, the author examines and analyzes the decorative motifs present in the lower sections of the tomb
of Khwaja Abdullah Ansari, focusing on the intricate geometric motifs that have endured over time.
12.1 Location of the Tomb of Khwaja Abdullah Ansari
The rectangular tomb is situated directly in front of the entrance gate of the Gazergah shrine, at the far end of the
courtyard. This prominent location enhances its visibility and significance within the complex. The tomb features
three distinct outlines, each adorned with geometric motifs and illumination designs characteristic of the Herat
school. These artistic elements contribute to the tomb's prominence, marking it as one of the finest examples of
artistic craftsmanship from the region during that period. The geometric motifs, often referred to as knotting, are
rendered in various forms, including arrangements of flowers, leaves, and specific geometric shapes governed by
established rules. The illumination designs and geometric motifs used in this context warrant further detailed
research. Due to the complexity and richness of these motifs, the current analysis will focus on a selection of
technical decorative elements.
12.2 Second Outline of the Tomb
The second outline of the tomb is crafted from black marble, commonly known as soapstone. The decorative
geometric motifs carved into this stone feature a six-pointed star pattern, intricately combined with a star knot at
its five corners. These designs exemplify the imaginative artistry of the Herat school during the Timurid era.
Although climatic factors have caused some deterioration of these motifs, their overall structure remains clearly
visible. The geometric designs are arranged in the form of a shamsa, an intricately decorated rosette or medallion
that often appears in various artistic contexts. This particular design features two symmetrical halves on either
side, with two full circles centrally positioned within the overall composition, showcasing the exceptional
craftsmanship and aesthetic sensibility of the artists of the time.
12.3 Hexagonal Knot
The hexagonal knot is intricately carved into stones and mosaic tiles, utilizing a palette of azure blue, fawn, and
black colors. These designs take the form of a hexagonal star, featuring repeating divisions that create a rhythmic
aesthetic, enhancing their overall beauty.
These techniques are grounded in the division of hexagons into equal parts derived from a circle, resulting in star
motifs that foster visual harmony. The designs possess richer, more sublime characteristics, contributing to the
intricate beauty of the artwork.
12.4 Top and Bottom Borders of Geometric Motifs
The upper and lower sections of this design are embellished with a distinctive border known as a lock knot. The
lower borders are adorned with flower and leaf motifs arranged in a crown shape, symmetrically repeated to
enhance the visual appeal of the petals.
All elements within the illumination are anchored around a central circle, with the crowns surrounding it enhancing
the diversity and beauty of the motifs. It is likely that these petal designs were also conceived in circular forms, as
this approach yields a more aesthetically pleasing effect. Additionally, these motifs can be rendered in smaller
sizes, demonstrating versatility in design.
In the center of the petals, variations take the form of crowns, which are elaborately detailed and enhanced with
intricate line work. This suggests that the petals were executed in multiple stages, with each layer adding depth
Asian Institute of Research Journal of Social and Political Sciences Vol.7, No.4, 2024
and complexity. The motifs along the edges are further beautified through the use of smooth Arabesque tracery,
which creates a cohesive visual stability among the elements.
12.5 Middle outline design
The middle outline of the tomb is crafted from white marble, which has aged to a yellowish hue over time. This
section features decorative geometric motifs in the form of a Shamsa, characterized by two halves at the center
and complete designs framing the edges.
The Shamsa design draws inspiration from both the circle and the sun, and its hexagonal divisions bear significant
similarities to the geometric designs found on the black marble. The divisions within the Shamsa can range from
1/8 to 1/24, with the central voids being of a medium size—balanced neither too large nor too small. These empty
spaces add a unique charm to the decorative geometric designs.
Overall, Shamsa designs can yield a variety of combinations, such as those seen in hexagonal configurations,
showcasing the creativity and adaptability of the illumination art form.
12.6 The Lower Part of the White Marble
The lower section of the tomb, made from white marble, has undergone color changes over time. To create
harmony with the surrounding decorative forms, the artist integrated an inscription with illuminated motifs.
Encircling the inscription is a border pattern in Kufic script, embellished with Arabesque tracery. The text reads,
"Allah is there and there is nothing other than Him," reflecting the themes of religious unity that are fitting for this
sacred site.
The Arabesque tracery serves as the main axis of the illumination motifs, incorporating spiral movements and
various decorative elements. At the foundation of these designs, circles are often employed, with decorative
features such as petals, almonds, and leaves arranged around them. Fortunately, the intricate details of these
geometric motifs remain clearly visible.
The smoothness of the Arabesque traceries, combined with their alternating designs, enhances the overall
composition. In the center of these motifs, the Arabesque traceries are adorned with petals, creating a beautiful
rhythmic effect. Recognized as a legitimate form of Islamic art, these traceries are frequently used to decorate the
Holy Quran, mosques, and other holy sites, including shrines.
12.7 Columns and Decorative Motifs
Surrounding the circumference of this lower part are columns made from black and white marble. The bases of
these columns feature decorations of half-Toranj, Ringent, and Kashkul motifs, although some details may not be
fully discernible. The Toranj motifs began with simple compositions that evolved into more complex designs,
beautifully carved with combinations of Toranj, half-Toranj, Ringent, and Kashkul elements interspersed with tiny
petals.
The starting point of the Toranj motif is notably elongated, contributing to a pleasing rhythm as these patterns are
strategically positioned to ensure balanced movements throughout the design. The decorative motifs of Toranj,
Ringent, and Kashkul are crafted to introduce variety and enhance overall beauty. Border patterns are typically
drawn from the corners first, with smooth rotations integrating other decorative elements throughout the designs.
Some Toranj motifs positioned centrally add strength and beauty to the entire illuminated composition.
12.8 Kashkul and Ringent Motifs
Kashkul, also known as the beggar's bowl, is a container traditionally carried by wandering dervishes within the
Sufi tradition. It is used to collect alms and other offerings. Variations of Kashkul motifs can be created by altering
Asian Institute of Research Journal of Social and Political Sciences Vol.7, No.4, 2024
certain elements, maintaining a circular main axis while surrounding it with leaf designs or other decorative
features. This approach amplifies diversity and volume, effectively filling empty spaces within the design.
The Ringent motif is another important component of illumination, widely utilized in various geometric forms. Its
inclusion enhances the strength and cohesion of the overall design when combined with the Toranj and Kashkul
motifs. The Ringent can manifest in numerous styles, easily integrated with almonds, petals, and other decorative
elements, both large and small. These proportions contribute delicacy and are applied thoughtfully according to
the design's scale, achieving a visual perfection that captivates the observer.
13. Conclusions

intricately tied to the artistic expressions found within this historical monument, which serve as both a tribute to
his teachings and a reflection of the vibrant artistic heritage of the region.
The decorative arts, particularly the illuminations and geometric motifs that adorn Ansari's tomb, exemplify the
sophistication of Islamic art as practiced in Herat. These designs are not merely ornamental; they encapsulate
deeper philosophical and spiritual meanings, aligning with the broader Islamic tradition that views art as a pathway
