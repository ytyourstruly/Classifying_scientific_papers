and humanoid robots [14]. Building on this, our current work has
three main goals:
(1) To validate our task in a face-to-face real world human-to-
human interaction, answering, for the first time whether hu-

mans spontaneously take another person’s perspective
when interacting with them face-to-face in the task.
(2) To resolve whether people truly take the perspective of a ro-
bot with a humanlike appearance in the real world, as prior
work with schematic displays seems to suggest.
(3) To identify factors outside of the robot’s appearance such as
goal-driven and socially reactive behaviours, which could
facilitate human perspective taking towards robots.
2 METHODOLOGY
2.1 Participants
Participant demographics for each group were as follows: Human-

tal blocks whether the participants’ partner (Human, Animate Robot,

Inanimate Robot) was positioned 90 to the right, or 90 to the left of
them. Usually, response times increase monotonically the more the
letter is oriented away from the participant [46], reflecting that peo-
ple first have to mentally rotate it into its usual upright orientation
before identifying its mirrored or non-mirrored form. However, if
people take another agent’s perspective, this should depend on both
the orientation of the letter towards the other agent. When letters are
facing the other partner, people should find it easier (quantified by
recognition time, RTs) to judge whether the character is in its regular
or mirrored presentation. Conversely, when the letter is facing away
from the other partner, individuals should find the task more difficult
[59–61]. This suggests that people are spontaneously assimilating
their own egocentric viewpoint with a quasi-perceptual simulation
of the likely estimation of the other person’s altercentric viewpoint.
Here, we tested whether people take the perspective of another
agent in a face-to-face interaction; whether the type of agent (Hu-
man/Robot) modules VPT; and finally, whether basic social and task
behaviours may induce VPT towards robots (Animate Robot/Inan-
imate Robot). Participants were either paired with another partici-
pant, a humanoid robot that remained inanimate for the duration of
the experiment, or the same robot, performing socially reactive and
goal-directed behaviours. Both social reactivity and goal-oriented
actions have been shown to be important for human-to-human per-
spective taking [18, 29]. In a between-subjects design, participants
were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups (see
spective taking.
2.3 Hypotheses
Our general predictions for both the Inanimate and Animate robot
pairings were first described in [14], prior to data collection (referred
to as Low Social/Task reactivity, and High Social/Task reactivity
respectively). For the present user study, our full predictions for all
pairings are as follows:
• Following prior research on VPT delivered on computer screens,
the robot’s mere humanlike appearance would be sufficient to
elicit overall VPT (i.e., VPT would be found when participants
were paired with both the inanimate and the animate robot).
• VPT should increase when participants are paired with a
robot that performs task-oriented and socially interactive be-
haviours relative to the inanimate robot. We assume that VPT
requires a humanlike appearance, but that this is amplified by
both functional and agentitive mental states, characterised
by the the ad-hoc generation of a model of the other’s func-
tional behaviour within a task; and the belief that the other is
an socially reactive agent capable of reacting in real-time to
an unpredictable social environment. In other words, when
participants are paired with the animate robot VPT will be
stronger than participants paired with the inanimate robot.
• VPT would be largest when participants were paired with
other humans. Even though the robot’s humanlike appear-
ance should be sufficient for VPT to manifest towards the
robot, and the robot’s animate behaviour would amplify this,
