Abstract
Introduction
With the rising global burden of mental health issues – namely depression and anxiety –
particularly among adolescents and young adults, it is crucial to investigate the factors that
influence the development of these mental health outcomes over the life course. Here, we
explored the associations between individual differences – personality and cognitive ability –
in adolescence with mental health problems in later adolescence and young adulthood using
longitudinal data from a UK birth cohort study (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and
Children; ALSPAC).
Methods
Personality was measured at age 13 using the ‘Big-5’ personality questionnaire, with
cognitive ability assessed at age 15 via the Weschler abbreviated scale of intelligence. ICD-10
classifications for mild depression and generalised anxiety disorder were assessed at ages 17
and 24 via the computerised clinical interview schedule (revised).
Results
In logistic regression models adjusted for a range of relevant sociodemographic and prior
mental health confounders, higher extraversion and emotional stability scores were
associated with lower rates of depression and anxiety, while higher openness to experience
scores were associated with increased rates. Agreeableness, conscientiousness and cognitive
ability had little-to-no association with mental health outcomes. Results were largely
consistent at both ages 17 and 24, and when using multiple imputation to account for
missing data and potential selection bias.
Conclusion
By using a large-scale longitudinal cohort with a range of relevant confounders, these results
provide further evidence that personality traits may potentially cause subsequent mental
health outcomes and could be used to help identify high-risk individuals.
Keywords: ALSPAC, individual differences, personality, cognitive ability, mental health,

Introduction
Mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, are the leading cause of disease
burden worldwide1. Adolescence and early adulthood are a critical life stage, marking the
transition from childhood to adult, where mental health issues often first present themselves2.
Nearly half of mental health issues have their onset by age 14, and three-quarters by mid-
20’s3, while depression and anxiety are the leading cause of disability and illness among
adolescents and young adults4. Despite this, the majority of the adolescents and young adults
do not receive the necessary treatment and support, with some even facing barriers in sharing
their condition and accessing the help required5. It is therefore important to tackle the
substantial burden of mental health problems through evidence-based prevention and early
intervention. This is achievable by a deeper understanding of the associations between mental
health and factors that may potentially impact it, at the inception of these problems early in
the life-span. While many such risk factors have been identified – including genetics,
traumatic/adverse childhood experiences, family history of mental health issues, sex/gender
and socioeconomic background6–10 – other psychological factors such as personality and
cognitive ability (together labelled as ‘individual differences’) have received less attention.
Personality traits within the OCEAN 5-factor framework consist of Openness
(imaginative/receptive to new ideas), Conscientiousness (dutiful/considerate), Extraversion
(active/sociable), Agreeableness (congenial/altruistic), and Neuroticism (emotional
irritability/instability; the inverse of which is labelled ‘Emotional Stability’)11. Within the
literature on personality traits and mental health there is a general consensus that neuroticism
is a consistent and strong predictor of negative mental health outcomes (e.g. through general
pessimism and sensitivity to negative feedback)12. There is also evidence for extraversion
playing a role, as a predictor of positive mental health outcomes (and has been identified to
be part of a cluster of traits identified as ‘positive emotionality’13)14. There is also lesser
evidence for conscientiousness predicting positive mental health (in an indirect way, through
negative outcomes, which lead to mental health issues); however many studies have failed to
find an association14. There is also a high degree of disagreement in the literature about the
role of openness in mental health, which vary from it having a negative (albeit weak) impact
on mental health (see 15 for a range of effect sizes within the literature), to no impact at all16,
to a positive impact17. Finally, agreeableness has few associations with mental health itself in
the literature but has been found to be positively related to treatment outcomes in patients
with depression18. Similar inconsistencies have also been observed in other individual
difference variables, such as intelligence/cognitive ability, which have evidence for being both
a risk19 and protective factor20.
These studies have weaknesses which limit their ability to infer whether these associations
between individual differences and mental health are causal or not. The use of longitudinal
data is inconsistent between studies – which can provide greater evidence for causality by
ruling out reverse causality (i.e., mental health impacting personality traits) – while the use of
control variables also varies between studies. Furthermore, individual difference variables are
not always examined simultaneously in the same study, with research often examining single
personality factors and single mental health outcomes. Based on this, the literature would
benefit from a study that looked at a range of individual differences variables and mental
health outcomes within a single, well-powered longitudinal sample.
The present study seeks to address the limitations of previous work by using a large,
longitudinal cohort study, with a range of relevant baseline confounders, and with individual
difference variables measured in early adolescence and mental health assessed in both later
adolescence and early adulthood.
Methods
Participants
Pregnant women resident in Avon, UK with expected dates of delivery between 1st April
1991 to 31st December 1992 were invited to take part in the study. The initial number of
pregnancies enrolled was 14,541, of which there were a total of 14,676 foetuses, resulting in
14,062 live births and 13,988 children who were alive at 1 year of age21,22. When the oldest
children were approximately 7 years of age, an attempt was made to bolster the initial
sample with eligible cases who had failed to join the study originally, resulting in an
additional 913 children being enrolled. The total sample size for analyses using any data
collected after the age of seven is therefore 15,447 pregnancies, resulting in 15,658
foetuses, of which 14,901 were alive at 1 year of age23 .
Observations were removed for offspring who were not alive at 1 year of age, were from
triplet or quadruplet pregnancies, or they, their mother or the mother’s partner (usually the
father) had withdrawn consent for their data to be used. This resulted in a sample size of
14,830 ALSPAC offspring. The sample size used for analyses contained all offspring with any
exposure or any outcome data (defined below), resulting in a final sample size of 7,564.
Please note that the study website contains details of all the data that is available through a
fully searchable data dictionary and variable search tool:
offspring were aged 22 were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture
tools hosted at the University of Bristol24.
Exposures
Personality was measured using the Big-5 personality scale25 at a study clinic when the
study children were approximately 13 years of age. Cognitive ability was assessed by the
Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence26 at a different study clinic when the children
were approximately 15 years of age. All exposures were analysed as continuous variables
(i.e., scores for each of the five personality traits and intelligence quotient [IQ] scores for
cognitive ability).
Outcomes
International Classification of Diseases (10th revision; ICD-10) diagnostic criteria were used to
define both mild depression and generalised anxiety disorder, as assessed by a self-
completed computerised Clinical Interview Schedule (revised; CIS-R) at study clinics when
the offspring were approximately aged 17 and 24, respectively27,28 .
Confounders
In an attempt to remove as much confounding bias as possible, and therefore hopefully
approach an unbiased causal estimate, we adjusted for a number of confounding variables
measured prior to the exposures and outcomes which may plausibly cause both the
exposures and the outcomes. These included: a range of sociodemographic factors (offspring
sex assigned at birth, offspring ethnicity, experience of traumatic/adverse childhood
experiences up to age 1129, parental education levels, parental area-level index of multiple
deprivation quintile at birth, parental home ownership status); parental depression and
anxiety scores in pregnancy (assessed via the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS]30
and the Crown-Crisp Experiential Index Anxiety subscale [CCEI-A]31)6–10; and prior mental
health of the child (depression and anxiety assessed at age 10 via a parent-reported
Development and Well-Being Assessment [DAWBA]32, child-reported depressive symptoms
score at age 10 via Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire [SMFQ]33, and parent-reported
total Strengths and Difficulties Score at age 11)34.
Analysis
Our main analyses were a series of logistic regression models for each of our exposures
(each of the five personality traits and cognitive ability) and each outcome (depression and
anxiety at ages 17 and 24). Models were repeated both unadjusted and adjusted for all
potential confounders detailed above. The odds ratios from these models represent the
difference in odds of having the outcome for a one-unit increase in the exposure. To help
improve the interpretability of our model coefficients, we have converted these models to
the predicted probabilities of the outcome at a range of exposure values (i.e., 1 standard
deviation [SD] below the mean value, at the mean value, and 1 SD above the mean value).
Due to missing data in our confounders, exposures and outcomes, the complete-case
analyses contained substantially fewer observations than the full 7,564 participants with any
exposure or outcome data (approx. 1,600 for analyses with mental health at age 24 as the
outcome; approx. 1,900 for analyses at age 17). As such, we used multiple imputation by
chained equations to impute this missing data up to the full 7,564 sample35,36. Analyses
using imputed data have two key advantages over standard complete-case analyses. First, by
using all of the available information from other variables and increasing the sample size
multiple imputation can improve the efficiency of analyses (i.e., narrower standard errors
and confidence intervals). Second, multiple imputation can also overcome potential
selection bias in the complete-case analysis due to the exposure and outcome being
associated with missingness37. Whether multiple imputation can correct for potential
selection bias depends on whether the ‘Missing-At-Random’ assumption is met, meaning
that differences between the missing data and observed data can be explained by the other
observed data (e.g., that missing depression data at age 24 can be recovered based on prior
mental health variables).
To try and meet this Missing-At-Random assumption, our imputation model will include all
exposures, outcomes and confounders listed above in our substantive analysis model, in
addition to a range of auxiliary variables which are not confounders but may help predict
missing exposure and outcome data38. These auxiliary variables include: prior cognitive
ability at age 8, presence of any behavioural disorders at age 13 (e.g., Oppositional Defiant
Disorder [ODD], conduct disorder; based on parent-reported DAWBA), and a range of
psychological and behavioural measures assessed between the ages of 15 and 17 (number
of suspected psychotic experiences, smoking status, alcohol intake [based on the Alcohol
Use Identification Test (AUDIT)]39, number of close friends, negative cognitive styles40, taken
any illegal drugs, and engagement in any antisocial behaviour). As many of these auxiliary
variables were assessed at age 17 – the same study clinic as one of the outcomes – we note
that these auxiliary variables will be missing for many of the same observations as those
missing the mental health at age 17 data; these auxiliary variables are therefore more likely
to help inform the imputations of the mental health outcomes at age 24, rather than those
at age 17. We imputed 50 datasets using a burn-in period of 10 iterations (this was checked
to ensure convergence).
However, despite the imputation model above, it is possible that data may still be ‘Missing-
Not-At-Random’, meaning that differences between the missing data and observed data
cannot be explained by the other observed data (e.g., that participants with depression at
age 24 are more likely to have missing depression data at this age). This example may be
plausible, as mental health problems have been associated with lower rates of continued
participation in ALSPAC previously41,42. To explore this possibility, we used an extension to
standard multiple imputation – called ‘Not-At-Random Multiple Imputation by Chained
Equations’ (NARMICE) – which includes a bias parameter allowing users to vary the strength
43,44
of the Missing-Not-At-Random mechanism . For instance, we can say that individuals
missing mental health data at age 24 are more likely to be depressed or anxious than
expected under standard multiple imputation. The explore this possibility, we conducted a
‘tipping-point’ NARMICE sensitivity analysis to explore how a range of bias parameters
impacted our conclusions. For each outcome, we explored five scenarios, from a bias
parameter of ‘0’ (i.e., assuming data are ‘Missing-At-Random’; identical to standard multiple
imputation), increasing in steps of 0.5 to ‘2’ (i.e., participants with missing mental health
data had 2 times greater log-odds of being either depressed or anxious, conditional on all
other variables in the imputation model). As these bias parameters are not intuitive to
interpret, to facilitate comprehension we will convert these to both the marginal odds ratio
difference in the outcome in those with vs without observed data and the associated
prevalence estimates. As NARMICE is more computationally intensive than standard multiple
imputation, for each set of imputations we generated 25 datasets with a burn-in period of 5
iterations.
All analyses were conducted in Stata v.18, with multiple imputation performed via the ‘mi
impute’ command and NARMICE using the ‘offset’ option.

Descriptive statistics
A summary of the sociodemographic backgrounds of participants and parental mental
health in pregnancy, comparing the full sample (n=14,830), analysis sample (n=7,564) and
complete-case analyses (n=1,636 and n=1,344; i.e., participants with complete confounder,
full sample approximately half of participants were female, 13% had a mother with a degree,
17% were from the most deprived areas, and 95% were of White ethnicity. However, in the
complete-case samples up to 60% of participants were female, one-quarter had a mother
with a degree, 6% were from the most deprived areas, and 97% were of White ethnicity.
Maternal depression and anxiety symptoms in pregnancy were also higher in the full sample
compared to the complete-case samples. Descriptive statistics for the offspring’s mental
children with mental health issues are somewhat less likely to have data in the complete-
case samples.
Approximately 40% (~6,000) of participants have data on the personality and cognitive
ability exposures. There is little difference between these values comparing between the
higher values of agreeableness, openness and cognitive ability.
participants in the full 14,830 sample had missing data for these outcomes. At age 17, 7.9%
of participants met the criteria for a diagnosis of mild depression, while 5.8% met the
diagnosis criteria for generalised anxiety disorder; these percentages were slightly lower in
the complete-case sample (6.4% for depression and 4.9% for anxiety). At age 24, 10.9% of
participants met the criteria for a diagnosis of mild depression, while 9.8% met the diagnosis
criteria for generalised anxiety disorder; again, these percentages were slightly lower in the
complete-case sample (9.2% for depression and 8.1% for anxiety).

precision in the imputed results, as expected), so we will focus on the adjusted results from
association between emotional stability and the depression (odds ratio [OR]=0.945, 95%
confidence interval [CI]=0.926 to 0.964, p<0.001); to help put this into perspective, based on
the adjusted model a change in emotional stability, from one standard deviation (SD) below
the mean to one SD above the mean, the predicted probability of depression decreased by
approximately half (from 13.6% to 7.1%, an absolute change of 6.5%-points; full predicted
was also found (OR=0.967, 95% CI=0.950 to 0.985, p<0.001), with predicted probability
results indicating a 5%-point reduction in rates of depression with a 2 SD increase in
extraversion (from 13.0% 1 SD below the mean to 8.8% 1 SD above the mean). Openness to
experience was positively associated with depression (OR=1.040, 95% CI=1.016 to 1.064,
p=0.001), with a 2 SD increase in openness predicting a 4%-point increase in rates of
depression (from 9.1% 1 SD below the mean to 13.0% 1 SD above the mean). There was
little association between agreeableness, conscientiousness and cognitive ability and the
depression outcome at age 24. The NARMICE tipping-point sensitivity analysis also
suggested that even if the outcome was Missing-Not-At-Random (i.e., participants with
missing data were more likely to be depressed than predicted under a standard Missing-At-
Random imputation model) this had little impact on the overall interpretation of results (see

analyses suggested little difference in interpretation for most exposures if the outcome was
Missing-Not-At-Random, although at higher values of the bias parameters (i.e., participants
with missing outcome data more likely to have generalised anxiety disorder) the associations
figures S7 to S12).
Results at age 17 years
As with the age 24 mental health analyses, the complete-case and multiple imputation
those at age 24, with higher values of emotional stability strongly associated with lower
rates of depression and anxiety, and openness to experience associated with an increased
associated with lower rates of anxiety, although the association with depression at age 17
was weaker than compared to at age 24. A slightly stronger association between
agreeableness and an increased probability of depression was found at age 17 relative to
age 24, although this was not fully-replicated for anxiety. Conscientiousness had a weak
negative association with both mental health outcomes, while there was little association
between cognitive ability and mental health. Despite these minor differences between ages
17 and 24 based on p-values and whether the 95% confidence intervals crossed the null,
overall the pattern of results was similar between the two time-points, with point estimates
NARMICE tipping-point analyses suggested that these associations were relatively robust to

Discussion
We found evidence for associations between emotional stability, openness and extraversion
with depression and anxiety outcomes in both adolescence and early adulthood.
Participants higher in extraversion and emotional stability (or, conversely, lower in
neuroticism) and lower in openness to experience were predicted to have lower risk of
mental health problems, with a predicted 2%-point to 7%-point reduction in rates of
depression and anxiety associated with a 2SD increase in these exposures. Agreeableness
had a weak positive association with mental health problems, and conscientiousness a weak
negative association, with little-to-no relationship observed for cognitive ability.
It is unsurprising that emotional stability/neuroticism displays a consistent role in mental
health, as reported previously16, given that neuroticism reflects a person’s tendency to
experience negative emotions more intensely and frequently45. The protective relationship
between extraversion and mental health has also consistently been found in previous
work17,46,47. One explanation for this association could be that extraversion, or the items
used to measure it, are functioning as a measure of optimism – which would account for its
association with better mental health, as extraversion and optimism are positively
associated48. Alternatively, it could be that the gregarious nature of highly extraverted
people means they are able to draw upon a larger social support network49, which may
reduce the risk of poor mental health50.
Beyond emotional stability/neuroticism and extraversion, however, the other factors –
openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness and cognitive ability – have a less robust body
of evidence to support them, with conflicting evidence for the direction of their association,
if any14–17. Our findings suggest that any relationship between agreeableness,
conscientiousness and cognitive ability and mental health in adolescence and young
adulthood is likely to be weak, at best. Nonetheless, assuming these results are causal (a
consideration we return to later in the discussion), these findings perhaps suggest that
agreeableness and conscientiousness may play a small role – and openness perhaps a larger
role – in the aetiology of mental health, and so merit a brief discussion.
While generally perceived as a positive trait regarding trustworthiness, non-confrontation,
and emotional sensitivity towards others, in the present study agreeableness was weakly
associated with worse mental health. Overall, studies have suggested little correlation
between agreeableness and mental health16, but perhaps the increased emotional
sensitivity associated with agreeableness might negatively impact mental health particularly
in adolescence and early adulthood, but less so in later adulthood, due to the stressors of
education and the transition to adulthood . Although often found to be negatively
associated with mental health issues16, here conscientiousness had little association with
depression and anxiety at age 24, but a slightly stronger negative association at age 17. A
potential explanation for the role of conscientiousness in anxiety in adolescence could be
the benefits of being a conscientious individual in a school setting, as it is associated with
greater academic achievement52; given that the need for academic achievement is a source
of stress to many adolescents , traits that aid in academic performance may help reduce
this source of stress, hence the stronger protective association in adolescence compared to
young adulthood. While previous literature for openness is mixed – often finding either a
negative or null relationship with mental health16 – here we observed a consistent positive
association between openness and mental health problems. A (very) tentative potential
explanation for this counter-intuitive relationship could again relate to the fact that this
population was in adolescence/early adulthood, which may show different associations
compared to a general population; for instance, as openness is related to non-conformity54,
and conformity to social norms is especially important in adolescence55, non-conformists
high in openness may suffer from higher rates of social exclusions/isolation and hence worse
mental health.
Unlike the results for emotional stability/neuroticism and extraversion, the observed
associations between agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness were surprising and
we lack a readily-available obvious explanation for them, with the potential explanations
given above being incredibly tentative and uncertain. This uncertainty is reflective of the
inconsistency of these associations in the wider literature, which could be attributed to
inter-study differences. For instance, variation between the study populations could be one
such explanation, such as differences in the relationship between these personality traits
and mental health by country and/or by age; as suggested above, perhaps the young age of
these ALSPAC participants may explain these differences in results observed here. The small
number of longitudinal studies, and heterogeneity in the use of confounders between
studies, could be another potential explanation. While the associations with neuroticism and
extraversion are robust and replicated here, we do not have a firm enough evidence base to
make strong conclusions regarding mental health and other personality traits; although
there appears to be little association with cognitive ability, which is broadly consistent with
existing literature . Future efforts should focus on replicating these analyses (particularly in
longitudinal studies), as well as exploring the mechanisms behind these contradictory and
heterogeneous findings.
Strengths and Limitations
This study possesses a number of key strengths. First, this research used data from a large-
scale population-based longitudinal birth cohort and adjusted for a range of potential
confounders – including prior mental health – assessed prior to the exposure and outcome.
The use of such longitudinal data with adjustment for many baseline confounders helps to
minimise the risk of confounding bias and reverse causality (i.e., prior mental health causing
personality traits), potentially providing stronger evidence for causality56. Second, we used
multiple imputation to account for potential selection bias due to missing data in complete-
case analyses. The multiple imputation and complete-case results were similar, suggesting
that either there was little bias in the complete-case analysis or that multiple imputation did
not remove this bias, perhaps because data were Missing-Not-At-Random; to explore this
possibility we conducted additional NARMICE sensitivity analyses to model scenarios where
participants with missing data were more likely to be depressed or anxious, although this
had little impact on results, suggesting that results are robust to the outcome data being
Missing-Not-At-Random.
There are, however, a number of issues which may limit a causal conclusion from these
results. First, although we adjusted for a range of relevant confounders, it is possible that
our results were biased by either unmeasured confounding (e.g., genetic factors) or residual
confounding (e.g., measurement error in the observed confounders – such as socioeconomic
position – meaning that these confounders may not have been adequately-adjusted for).
Second, measurement error in the exposures and/or outcomes may also have resulted in
bias, especially given potential social desirability bias for sensitive topics such as mental
health. However, both the exposure and outcome were assessed using well-validated scales,
and previous ALSPAC work has shown that such self-reported measures of mental health
correspond well with gold-standard measures such as clinical interviews57, providing some
assurance of valid measurements.
A third potential limitation is that, although we used multiple imputation to account for
potential selection bias, we only imputed approximately 7,500 observations with either
observed exposure or outcome data, roughly half of the full ALSPAC sample. There is
therefore a possible risk of selection bias due to missing data prior to these time-points.
However, we did not impute to the full sample for a number of reasons: i) there was little
additional information from other auxiliary variables to inform the imputations, meaning
there would be little benefit to imputing to a larger sample, and perhaps an increased risk of
mis-specifying the imputation model leading to biased results; ii) by including prior mental
health of both the offspring and their parents as confounders in the substantiative analysis
model and in the imputation model, this should increase the probability of meeting the
Missing-At-Random assumption and reducing bias; and iii) offspring personality and mental
health are less likely to determine participation in ALSPAC early in life compared to when
older, with much participation in early life determined by the parents, hopefully reducing the
risk of outcome data being Missing-Not-At-Random. Finally, as noted above, given that the
population consisted of adolescents and young adults from the Bristol area of southwest
England, generalisability is a concern as associations may differ by country and/or
generation; further longitudinal and cross-cultural work is needed to understand how
generalisable these results are.
Conclusion
Consistent with previous research, in this longitudinal UK birth cohort, we find that aspects
of personality – namely neuroticism and extraversion – are strongly associated with
depression and anxiety in adolescence and young adulthood. Relationships with openness,
agreeableness, conscientiously and cognitive ability were weaker and/or less consistent with
previous research. These results suggest that personality traits such as neuroticism, and to a
lesser extent extraversion, could be used to help screen for those at higher risk of mental
health issues, as well as inform the targeting of mental health messaging campaigns to at-
risk populations. However, there are many open questions regarding the role of other
personality traits and their relationship with mental health.
