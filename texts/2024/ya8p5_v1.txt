You Are (NOT) Your Mistakes: Downstream Consequences of Essentialist
and Behavioral Work Feedback
Abstract
Feedback from superiors in cases of mishaps is provided more or less
frequently and can be related to the person who makes the mistake or to the
behavior causing it. Prior research uncovered the benefits of behavioral
praise vs. person praise; however, surprisingly, little is known about the
extent of person-focused negative feedback in organizational settings and
its downstream productivity-related and emotional context. The present
work demonstrates results across one descriptive and four experimental
studies (N =1,908) and provides evidence for the widespread presence
overall
(Study 1) and detrimental effects (Studies 2-5) of essentialist (e.g., “you are an
inattentive person”) over behavior-focused (e.g., “you did not pay attention”)
feedback leading to lower levels of work motivations, reduced
organizational commitment, decreased seeking professional assistance,
decreased perceived post-feedback performance, and lower willingness to
correct the mistake, more intense rumination on the feedback, worsened
relationship quality between the supervisor and the employee. Studies 3-5
demonstrated that feedback's performance and emotional consequences
remain significant if the supervisor is competent or related to another
common feedback content (forgetfulness). It appears that psychological
benefits can be maximized if the behavior-focused feedback also refers to
an external element (“you must have been tired”). Study 6 extended this
research by examining how essentialist and behavior-focused feedback
spread in spontaneous language use within organizational settings. In sum,
this work suggests that behavior-focused feedback is not as common as it
could be and can contribute to an organizational climate with numerous
motivational and emotional benefits.

Introduction
Similarly to a positive suggestion, a destructive remark can trigger
recursive processes in performance-oriented situations. In past research,
Mueller and Dweck (1998) explored the multifaceted benefits of behavior-
focused, growth- and learning-promoting feedback (such as “you must have
worked hard”) over essentialist feedback (like “you must be smart at this”) in
educational settings. However, no convincing evidence was found for
similar effects of behavioral vs. essentialist feedback on motivation and
performance among adults in the organizational context. In the present
work, we explored the relative presence of essentialist feedback compared
to behavioral feedback, their emotion- and performance-related
consequences, and the most crucial boundary conditions of their effects.
Feedback has long been the subject of extensive research and debate
in organizational psychology. Ammons (1956) initially posited that feedback
enhances learning and proficiency, suggesting its positive impact on
performance and motivation. This perspective, rooted in behaviorist
principles, underscored the importance of performance-related knowledge
in correcting errors.
Through a meta-analysis, Kluger and DeNisi (1996) challenged the
straightforward positive link between feedback and performance, revealing
that feedback can sometimes diminish performance. Their work on
feedback interventions showed diverse feedback effects, with about one-
third of analyzed studies indicating a negative impact on performance.
They found one key factor of feedback effectiveness is its focus on the task
(e.g., specific behaviors) instead of the self (i.e., personality). They also
highlighted the significance of various situational factors beyond the
personality (e.g., the source, recipient, and feedback stimulus). Expanding
on this, Lechermeier and Fassnacht (2018) reviewed the literature to
understand factors affecting feedback perceptions. Their work extended the
scope to include a variety of receiver responses, such as perceptions,
intentions, emotions, and behaviors. They developed a conceptual
framework focusing on determinants of feedback perceptions, including
the nature of the message, source, task, and individual characteristics of the
recipient, as well as the interactions between these factors. However, this
more recent review on organizational feedback did not focus on the
potential clash between essentialist and behavior-oriented feedback.
The above-described experiment (Mueller & Dweck, 1998) and
Dweck’s theory (see, Dweck, 2017; Dweck & Yeager 2019) led to a broad
stream of research not only in educational but also in organizational
contexts (Canning et al., 2019; Dweck, 2017; Ibarra et al., 2019; Emerson &
Murphy, 2014; Murphy & Dweck, 2009; Wallace et al., 2023). However,
these studies focused on organizational climate, collaboration, burnout,
equity, trust, affect and person-organization fit, and not necessarily the
feedback aspect that can promote adaptive beliefs. From this perspective,
the present work can provide some initial evidence that personality
feedback can lead to more detrimental performance and emotional
outcomes than behavioral feedback.
The main aim of the present work is to focus on an atomic element,
namely a specific, brief single-sentence feedback. Therefore, our first goal
(Study 1) was to demonstrate the significant presence of personality
feedback in everyday workplace situations. We assumed that this type of
feedback is saliently present as HR departments invest significant amounts
of resources to implement large-scale work-related personality-feedback
interventions providing outdated, oversimplified personality categories.
Our second goal was to demonstrate that essentialist feedback leads to lower
performance expectations and adverse emotional consequences compared
to behavior-focused feedback (Study 2-5). Our third goal was to
demonstrate that these effects are robust and stable even after considering
relevant covariates, such as the perceived competence of the supervisor
who provides the feedback and the feedback content (Study 3-5). Study 4
demonstrated psychometrically solid outcome measures, while Study 5 was
studies).

Study 1: Workplace Prevalences of Essentialist vs. Behavioral Feedback
In Study 1, our primary goal was to complete a general assessment of
the predominant feedback type in the Hungarian organizational context.
Specifically, the aim was to assess the prevalence of receiving essentialist
feedback compared to behavioral feedback. Through this initial study, we
intended to gain a clearer understanding of the extent to which essentialist
feedback is used and evaluate its prevalence from the perspective of
subordinates. Additionally, as a preliminary study, we sought to identify the
feedback content of the greatest potential, being almost equally prevalent in
everyday discourse in both essentialist and behavior-focused formats. This
identification would enable us to construct experimental materials centered
around characteristics or behaviors that are equally plausible to use in both
essentialist and behavioral feedback formats. To achieve this, we presented
a set of common characteristics and behaviors, both negative and positive,
and solicited their evaluations regarding the presence of these aspects in
their work life.
Methods
Participants
For this exploratory study, a total of 740 Hungarian participants were
recruited via social media and from university courses. Exclusion criteria
were: (1) informed consent was not provided (n=132), (2) was currently
unemployed (n=32), and (3) questionnaire was not finished (n=189). The
final sample consisted of 387 employees. Of these, 226 were female (58.40%),
84 were male (21.71%), five selected other (1.29%), and 72 did not answer
(18.60%). Participants aged between 19 and 59 (M =25.48 years, SD =7.82
age age
years). As far as their level of education was concerned, 111 of them had
higher education (28.68%), 204 had high school or lower (52.71%), and 72 did
not answer (18.60%). A total of 258 worked at the subordinate level (66.67%),
38 of them worked as middle managers (9.82%), five worked as senior
managers (1.29%), 15 selected other (3.88%), and 71 did not answer (18.35%).
Regarding work type, 144 worked as white collars (37.21%), 77 as blue collars
(19.90%), 95 selected other (24.55%), and 71 did not answer (18.35%).
Materials and procedure
The data gathering occurred on Qualtrics. Participants gave their
informed written consent first in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki by ticking a box before participation. Participants were taken
straight to the end of the survey if they did not give this consent.
Participants were then asked whether their supervisor would prefer to
give behavioral or essentialist feedback. To determine this, they divided 100
points between behavioral feedback (e.g., “you acted inattentively”) and
essentialist feedback (e.g., “you are inattentive”). Overall, there were 12
behavioral-essentialist feedback pairs with 12 different adjectives
(inattentive, selfish, scattered, forgetful, inaccurate, disrespectful, aggressive, clever,
smart, intelligent, precise, polite) that can be easily heard in an organizational
context. After these feedback pairs, participants were requested to answer
demographic questions (e.g., “Are you currently employed?”).
Data Analysis
Statistical analysis and data visualization were performed with R
(version 4.4.2; R Core Team, 2024). Within R, the sjPlot (Lüdecke, 2023) and
the tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019) and the ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016)
packages were used for data transformation and visualization The
difference between the likelihood of giving essentialist and behavioral
feedback was analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
Results
The results indicated that overall, there is a significant difference, V =
30198, p=0.003, between the feedback type the participants’ supervisors
prefer to give. More precisely, they tend to provide behavioral feedback
(M =52.12, SD =13.10) rather than essentialist feedback (M =47.88,
behavioral behavioral essentialist
SD =13.10).
essentialist
However, further analyses showed that if there are only positive
adjectives presented, essentialist feedback (M =56.65, SD =17.78) had a
essentialist essentialist
higher likelihood than behavioral feedback (M =43.35, SD =17.78) V =

51287, p<0.001, and in case of negative adjectives being displayed,
essentialist feedback (M =41.62, SD =20.18) had a lower likelihood

than behavioral feedback (M = 58.38, SD =20.18) V = 20822, p<0.001.

Discussion
The goal of the first study was to explore the relative presence of
essentialist vs. behavioral feedback in the Hungarian organizational context.
According to the non-representative Hungarian sample, regarding the 12
investigated characteristics, we found that the feedback they receive is
essential in almost half of the cases. More precisely, when participants
receive negative feedback, it tends to be presented in an essentialist form
more than 40% of the time. On the other hand, when positive feedback is
examined, the content is presented in an essentialist manner in almost 60%
of cases.
Therefore, based on this preliminary exploratory study, it can be
assumed that essentialist feedback is vividly present in the Hungarian
organizational culture. Furthermore, among all the characteristics, “being
smart” (“ügyes” in Hungarian) was perceived most frequently in an
essentialist form, indicating an excellent characteristic choice of the seminal
developmental and social psychology research on essentialist vs. behavioral
feedback (Mueller & Dweck, 1998).
Based on these results, the characteristic “inattentive” appeared to be a
good choice for further experimental examination as its presence is close to
50% in both essentialist and behavioral forms in everyday discourse.
Therefore, in the following experimental studies of our study series, this
characteristic was chosen as the core element of the feedback.
Study 2: Salient Differences between Essentialist and Behavioral
Feedback in Workplace Dynamics and Feedback-related Challenges
In Study 2, a systematic manipulation of feedback type (essentialist vs.
behavioral) was conducted within a hypothetical workplace scenario. The
aim was to focus on a type of feedback commonly encountered in everyday
work situations, present in both essentialist and behavioral forms (according
to the results of study 1, the characteristic inattentiveness is a suitable choice).
Following Mueller and Dweck’s (1998) tradition, a term akin to “smart”
would have been an obvious choice. However, applying the Hungarian
equivalent of the “smart” attribute was deemed impractical, as its behavioral
counterpart sounds unnatural without major modifications. Additionally,
using extremely positive (“smart”) or negative (“aggressive”) feedback
content was consciously avoided, and the use of a characteristic less
offensive in its essentialist form was preferred. Our research examined the
impact of different feedback types on the recipients’ attitudes towards their
work, supervisor, workplace, and emotions post-feedback. It was
hypothesized that essentialist feedback would more negatively affect all
anticipated performance and affective outcomes compared to behavioral
feedback.
Methods
Participants
Based on the results of previous feedback studies (Kluger & DeNisi,
1996; Wisniewski et al., 2020), medium effect sizes (Cohen’s d = 0.4) may be
anticipated when comparing different conditions. For this research design
with a d=0.40 effect size (power=0.80, alpha=0.05, and one predictor), the
suggested sample size was 198 participants. As part of the data gathering, a
total of 167 participants were recruited via social media and from university
courses. Exclusion criteria were: (1) informed consent was not provided, or
the participant is under 18 (n=0), (2) sufficient data was not provided (n=5);
thus, the final sample consisted of 162 Hungarian participants. Of these, 118
were female (72.84%), 39 were male (24.07%), and all were aged between 18
and 53 (M =24.22 years, SD =7.70 years). As far as their level of education
age age
was concerned, 48 of them had higher education (29.63%) and 109 had
secondary education (67.28%). A total of 143 (88.27%) had an active student
status and a total of 107 (66.05%) were employed. Of these, 96 worked at the
subordinate level (89.72%), nine of them worked as middle managers (8.41%),
and one worked as a senior manager (0.93%).
Materials and Procedure
Participants provided their informed consent at the beginning of the
Qualtrics survey, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. In the
subsequent vignette study, they were randomly assigned to one of two
conditions, receiving either behavioral or essentialist feedback. In the
behavioral condition, participants were asked to imagine a scenario where a
competent supervisor with whom they have a good relationship expresses
dissatisfaction with their performance. The feedback provided in this
scenario was, “You must have been tired, because there are several typos in
the results section due to inattention. Correct them!” The essentialist
condition was structurally similar, but the feedback was different. Here,
participants received essentialist feedback stating, “Since you are an
inattentive person, there are several typos in the results section. Correct
them!” Subsequently, the outcome measures were assessed (see below), as
well as the sociodemographic data (gender, age, education, work status).
Measures
Manipulation Check. Participants were asked to answer atwo
manipulation check questions about the perceived type of the feedback
(“To what extent is the feedback directed at your behavior?” and “To what
extent is the feedback directed at your personality?”) on a 5-point Likert
scale (1: Not at all, 2: Little, 3: Moderately, 4: Mostly, 5: Completely).
Outcome Measures. The outcome items were evaluated on a five-
point Likert scale using one positively and one negatively worded item (1:
Not at all, 2: Little, 3: Moderately, 4: Mostly, 5: Completely). The following
items were assessed: willingness to correct the mistake (“How likely would you
correct the typos in the results section?”; “How likely are you to act on the
feedback?”, r=0.72, p<0.001, α=0.83, ω=0.83); relationship with the supervisor
(“To what extent would this feedback improve your relationship [with your
supervisor]?”; “To what extent would this feedback make your relationship
worse [with your supervisor]?”, r=-0.53, p<0.001, α=0.70, ω=0.70; performance
(“How much would this feedback improve your performance?”, “How much
would this feedback worsen your performance?”, r=-0.43, p<0.001, α=0.62,
ω=0.62), work motivation (“How motivating would you find this feedback?”,
“How much resistance would this feedback provoke in you?”, r=-0.57,
p<0.001, α=0.73, ω=0.73), and general feeling (“How good would this feedback
make you feel?”, “How bad would this feedback make you feel?”, r=-0.62,
p<0.001, α=0.74, ω=0.74).
Data Analysis
Power calculation was carried out with R Studio using the package
pwr (Champely et al., 2020). Statistical analysis and data visualization were
performed with R (version 4.4.2; R Core Team, 2024). Within R, the sjPlot
(Lüdecke, 2023) and the tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019) and the
ggplot2(Wickham, 2016) packages were used for data transformation and
visualization The effects of essentialist and behavioral feedback on the
outcome variables were analyzed using Ordinary least squares (OLS)
regression analysis.
Results
According to the manipulation check, participants in the essentialist
feedback condition (M =4.10, SD=1.03) perceived the feedback as being

directed at their personality to a significantly greater extent than
participants in the behavioral feedback condition (M =2.21, SD=1.19),
behavioral
b=1.89, t(1,160)=10.79, p<0.001, d=1.30.
in contrast to the essentialist feedback condition, (M =2.70,

SD=0.58), participants in the behavioral feedback condition (M =3.43,
behavioral
SD=0.65) perceived that the feedback focuses on the behavior, b=-1.01,
t(1,160)=-7.48, p<0.001, d=0.72.
Pre-manipulation differences across the sociodemographic variables
were examined to assess the random allocation of participants to different
conditions. The analysis revealed no statistically significant baseline
differences between the two conditions in terms of gender, student status,
employment status, job level (ps>0.103) except for the level of education
(p=0.007). Therefore, all analyses were verified by adding the level of
education as a control variable, which did not lead to any meaningful
changes in the outcomes.
Our research questions were related to the main effect of behavioral
vs. essentialist feedback manipulation on the outcome variables. The OLS
regressions showed that behavior feedback had a more positive impact on
every measured variable than essentialist feedback. More specifically,
participants who received behavioral feedback, compared to the ones
receiving essentialist feedback, reported stronger willingness to correct the
mistake, b=-0.87, t(2,154)=-6.04, p<0.001, d=0.89; improved relationship with
their supervisor, b=-1.56, t(2, 154)=-11.38, p<0.001, d=1.36; improved
performance, b=-1.06, t(2, 154)=-7.56, p<0.001, d=1.04; motivation benefits, b=-

p<0.001, d=1.04. In sum, the present study showed that compared to
essentialist feedback, behavioral feedback—in which the role of situational
factors was highlighted—had tremendous benefits in the most important

Discussion
Study 2 employed essentialist vs. behavioral feedback vignettes and
found salient effects on their potential work-related outcomes
(0.89≤ds≤1.36). In the essentialist feedback, there was no question that
inattentiveness is an inherent and stable trait of the employee, and it
focuses on the person itself (“Since you are an inattentive person, there are
several typos in the results section. Correct them!”); however, the behavioral
feedback was not only behavior-focused but also provided a ready-made
unstable (and controllable) cause (“You must have been tired because there are
several typos in the results section due to inattention. Correct them!”) and focused
on the outcome of the person’s behavior. This phrasing may reduce the
tension negative feedback can cause, and at the same time, it may imply
that the person can do a better job. This framing and focus might be
responsible for the relatively salient effects. Therefore, in the following
studies (Study 3-5), the readymade excuse has been dropped, and the
experimental design and the outcome measures (Study 3-5) were further
polished to examine the conditions under which the benefits of behavior-
focused feedback can be expected to occur (over essentialist feedback).
Study 3: Boundary Conditions of the Divide between Essentialist vs.
Behavioral Feedback
In Study 3, the primary objective of the research remained
unchanged, and as a next step, the effects of behavioral feedback in contrast
to essentialist feedback were examined. By drawing upon insights from
Study 2, the wording employed in the vignettes was refined, and the
formerly utilized items were adjusted. In addition, to test the robustness of
the effect of Study 1, another characteristic was introduced that can appear
in its behavioral and essentialist form in the everyday discourse relatively
evenly. Based on the findings of Study 1, forgetfulness became the second
characteristic, often used in both the essentialist and behavior-based
formats. We also found it necessary to examine the potential impact of the
supervisor’s perceived competence on the performance and motivations of
the subordinates (e.g., Fransen et al., 2017). As a result, in Study two
additional manipulated variables were introduced, specifically the targeted
characteristic within the feedback (inattention vs. forgetfulness) and the
competence of the supervisor (competent vs. incompetent), hence study 3
became more complex, resulting in a 2 (feedback type: behavioral vs.
essentialist) × 2 (feedback content: inattention vs. forgetfulness) × 2
(competence of the supervisor: not competent vs. competent) vignette
design.
Besides these changes, we made some adjustments in the wording of
the outcome items, and further items were added to assess potential long-
term (engagement), interpersonal goal-directed (asking help from the
supervisor), and further affective (rumination) consequences of the
feedback. Therefore, our goal was to confirm whether the behavioral vs.
essentialist feedback on post-feedback performance and emotions still
holds without an external excuse, above and beyond the content of the
feedback and the perceived competence of the leader.
Methods
Participants
Despite observing relatively high effect sizes in Study 2, it was unclear
whether these strong effects still hold without the external reason (first
modification). For the 2×2×2 design with a d=0.40 effect size (power=0.80,
alpha=0.05, and three predictors) the suggested sample size was 277
participants. However, given the uncertainty surrounding the expected
dropout rate in the study, and the fact that the aforementioned feedback
studies informing the effect size were not vignette studies, a larger sample
was collected.
As part of the data gathering, a total of 580 participants were recruited
via a university course. Exclusion criteria were: (1) informed consent was
not provided, or the participant is under 18 (n=6), (2) sufficient data was not
provided (n=336); thusAfter data cleaning, the final sample consisted of 238
participants. Of these, 160 were female (67.23%), 75 were male (31.51%), one
chose other (0.42%). All were aged between 18 and 72 (M =31.86 years,
age
SD =12.55 years). As far as their level of education was concerned, 96 of
age
them had higher education (40.34%) and 140 had secondary education
(58.82%). A total of 154 (61.76%) had an active student status and a total of 186
(78.15%) were currently employed. Of these, 147 worked as subordinates
(79.03%), 28 worked as middle managers (15.05%) and nine worked as senior
managers (4.84%). Regarding employment status, 111 worked full-time
(59.68%), 57 worked part-time (30.65%) and 18 occasionally (9.68%).
Materials and Procedure
Procedure
Eight vignettes have been completed (2×2×2 design) with behavioral
vs. essentialist feedback as feedback type, inattention vs. forgetfulness as
feedback content, not competent vs. competent supervisor. Compared to
Study 2, we modified the wording of the feedback, as in the original
behavioral condition the prompt did not focus purely on the behavior (e.g.,
“due to inattention”) but it also provided an additional external excuse (“you
must have been tired […]”) for the poor performance. To be psychologically
more precise, in the present study, this external explanation was not
provided, and only the behavioral feedback was kept. We also added some
new outcome questions, as well as the perceived competence of the
supervisor was manipulated (see below).
Behavioral and essentialist feedback type. Participants were
requested to imagine themselves in a situation where their supervisor gave
negative feedback on their behavior. In the behavioral feedback condition, the
feedback was related to their behavior (e.g., “Look, there are a lot of
misspellings in the results section, it’s because when you wrote it you didn't
pay attention!”). In the essentialist feedback condition, the feedback was given
based on the participant’s personality (e.g., "Look, there are a lot of
misspellings in the results section, it’s because you are an inattentive
person!").
Inattention and forgetfulness as feedback content: In the
inattentiveness condition the feedback referred to not being attentive, while
feedback in the forgetfulness condition referred to forgetting something.
Manipulation of the competence of the supervisor. The employee-
supervisor relationship was considered satisfactory as a constant in each
vignette so that any change, either positive or negative, would be more
easily identifiable. The competence of the supervisor was manipulated in
the following way: in the competent supervisor condition the feedback was
given by a professionally competent supervisor (“whom you consider
professionally competent”), while in the not competent supervisor condition the
feedback was given by a professionally incompetent supervisor (“whom you
consider professionally incompetent”).
Measures
Manipulation Check. In Study 3, there was only one manipulation
check question about the perceived type of the feedback (“According to the
situation, how much is the feedback directed at your personality?”, 1: Not at
all, 2: Little, 3: Moderately, 4: Mostly, 5: Completely), and one was added
about the competency of the supervisor (“According to the situation, how
competent did you consider your supervisor to be before the feedback?”, 1:
Not at all, 2: Little, 3: Moderately, 4: Mostly, 5: Completely).
Outcome Measures. To avoid creating an overly lengthy
questionnaire, the manipulation check was followed by the items which
demonstrated the largest effect among the positive and negative item pairs
in Study 2: willingness to correct the mistake (“How likely are you to act on the
feedback?”); relationship with the supervisor (“To what extent would this
feedback improve your relationship [with your supervisor]?”); performance
improvement (“How much would this feedback improve your
performance?”); motivational benefit (“How motivating this feedback would
be?”); and general feeling (“How good would this feedback make you feel?”).
We implemented three additional items focusing on organizational
commitment (“How much would this feedback weaken your commitment to
the organization?”), willingness to seek professional assistance from supervisor
(“How likely are you to approach your supervisor with professional
inquiries?”), and rumination on feedback (“How likely are you to ruminate on
this feedback throughout the day?”). All the outcome measures used the
following scale: 1: Not at all, 2: Little, 3: Moderately, 4: Mostly, 5:
Completely. The demographic questions remained the same.
Data Analysis
Power calculation was carried out with R Studio using the package
pwr (Champely et al., 2020). Statistical analysis and data visualization were
performed with R (version 4.4.2; R Core Team, 2024). Within R, the sjPlot
(Lüdecke, 2023) and the tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019) and the ggplot2
(Wickham, 2016) packages were used for data transformation and
visualization
The 2×2×2 design was tested by OLS regression models (feedback
content: inattention vs. forgetfulness; competence of the supervisor: not
competent vs. competent; feedback type: behavioral or essentialist) on the
outcome items.
Results
Manipulation Checks. Participants assigned to the essentialist
condition evaluated the feedback referring to more on the personality
(M =3.68, SD=1.23) than those who were allocated to the behavior
essentialist
condition (M =2.92, SD=1.18), b=0.75, t(1,236)=4.83, p<0.001, d=0.60.

Additionally, participants who were assigned to the competent supervisor
condition evaluated the supervisor more competent (M =4.03, SD=1.09)

than those who were allocated in the not competent supervisor condition
(M =2.44, SD=0.98), b=1.59, t(1,236)=11.73, p<0.001, d=1.22. To assess the
incompetent
random allocation of participants to different conditions, we examined pre-
manipulation differences across the sociodemographic variables. The
analysis revealed no statistically significant baseline differences between the
two conditions in terms of gender, student status, employment status, job
level, employment type (ps>0.352).
Post-feedback Consequences. Our first research question was related
to the main effects of behavioral vs. essentialist feedback manipulation on
the outcome items. The OLS regressions showed that participants receiving
behavioral feedback, as opposed to ones receiving essentialist feedback,
reported stronger willingness to correct the mistake, b=0.56, t(1,236)=3.93,
p<0.001, d=0.49; stronger willingness to seek professional assistance from their
supervisor, b=0.68, t(1,236)=4.66, p<0.001, d=0.58; strengthened organizational
commitment (reversed item), b=-0.62, t(1,236)=-4.11, p<0.001, d=0.52; improved
relationship with their supervisor, b=0.52, t(1,236)=4.03, p<0.001, d=0.51;
improved performance, b=0.50, t(1,236)=3.35, p<0.001, d=0.42; stronger post-
feedback work motivation, b=0.62, t(1,236)=4.04, p<0.000, d=0.51; and more
positive emotions, b=0.45, t(1,236)=4.39, p<0.001, d=0.55. All these differences
remained significant after controlling for feedback content (inattention vs.
forgetfulness) and the perceived competence of the leader as covariates (see
SM 1 for details). However, no significant difference was detected in the
extent to which respondents ruminate on the feedback, b=-0.26, t(1,236)=-1.67,
p=0.095, d=0.22, along the feedback type (essentialist vs. behavioral), which
was also true after controlling for the two covariates mentioned above (for

Without setting prior hypotheses on potential moderation effects, we
explored the interaction between the competence of the supervisor and the type
of the feedback. We found significant interactions regarding two outcome
variables: willingness to correct the mistake, b=0.82, t(3, 234)=2.95, p=0.003,
d=0.73; and the probability of seeking professional assistance from supervisor,
b=0.69, t(3, 234)=2.75, p=0.006, d=0.59. More specifically, participants would
rather act on the feedback and seek professional assistance from their
supervisor if their supervisor was competent and gave behavioral feedback.

supervisor using behavioral feedback, competent supervisor using
essentialist feedback, incompetent supervisor using essentialist feedback).
No other interaction emerged (see SM 2 for details).

intervals.
Discussion
After removing the ready-made external unstable cause from the
behavioral feedback in Study 3, we found that the essentialist feedback still
led to less adaptive consequences than the behavioral feedback type.
Participants who were exposed to behavioral feedback showed higher
willingness to correct the mistake, higher willingness to seek professional
assistance from their supervisor, strengthened organizational commitment,
improved relationship with their supervisor, improved post-feedback
performance, stronger post-feedback work motivation, and more positive
emotions compared to participants from the essentialist condition. The
level of rumination did not differ significantly between the essentialist and
behavioral feedback conditions. However, while in Study 2 the effect sizes
were large, ranging between d=0.73 and d=1.23; in Study 3 using similar
outcome measures, they were small to moderate, ranging between d=0.21
and d=0.54.
The main effects of essentialist vs. behavioral conditions remained
statistically significant (and insignificant in the case of rumination) even
after controlling for two experimentally manipulated variables: feedback
content and the perceived competence of the supervisor. This implies that,
irrespective of the specific adjective we used in the present study, or the
competence evaluation of the supervisor, except for rumination, all
performance-related and emotional consequences showed the same pattern
across conditions. Moreover, we found an interaction between the type of
feedback (behavioral vs. essentialist) and the perceived competence of the
supervisor, in relation to acting on feedback and seeking professional
assistance. Based on these results, for individuals to bring professional
concerns to their supervisors and take action to improve tasks, both
behavioral feedback and supervisor competence are essential.
In summary, in Study 3, the vignette text was modified, eliminating
the explicit influence of a ready-made, external unstable excuse (“you must
have been tired” as used in Study 2) to provide a clearer comparison of the
effect of essentialist and behavioral feedback. In addition, we applied and
experimentally manipulated an additional feedback content (forgetfulness)
beyond the original (inattention), and experimentally manipulated the
competence of the supervisor providing the feedback. These modifications
led to a notable decrease in effect sizes compared to those observed in
Study 2. However, moderate effects persisted across most work-related
dimensions, except for rumination. These findings seem to be applicable
beyond the characteristic of inattention, as the consistency was upheld
when the regression model included feedback about forgetfulness and
diverse perceptions of supervisor competence (not competent vs.
competent).
However, the comprehensive interpretation of results is constrained
by certain factors. First, interaction effects were observed for some factors
but not for aggregated scales, given the present sample size limitations. To
address this, Study 4 aimed to gather a larger sample for testing
moderations. Second, in Study 3, the absence of opposite poles for some
items limited the full assessment of potential negative effects on aspects like
relationships, performance, and organizational commitment. Therefore,
Study 4 seeks to enhance scale psychometrics by adding opposite poles.
Study 4: Replication and Refinement of Examination of Boundary
Conditions
The main goal of Study 4 was to investigate the effects of behavioral
vs. essentialist feedback using the same 2×2×2 experimental design as
described in Study 3 (feedback type: behavioral vs. essentialist; feedback
content: inattention vs. forgetfulness; competence of the supervisor: not
competent vs. competent). In the present case we used the simplified item
set identified in Study 3; however, in the present case participants could
report whether the feedback would improve or worsen the given
dimension. For example, “To what extent would this feedback [1] improve /
[2] worsen your relationship with your supervisor?”. Therefore, the present
study allowed us to check the robustness of the findings by considering the
competence of the leader and the content of the feedback with a simplified
and more appropriate item-set.
Methods
Participants
Similarly to Study 3, for the 2×2×2 design with a d=0.30 effect size
(power=0.80, alpha=0.05, and three predictors), the suggested sample size
was 488 participants. A total of 828 participants were recruited via social
media and from university courses. Exclusion criteria: informed consent
was not provided, the participant was under 18 years of age (n=4), and
sufficient data was not provided (n=344). Therefore, the final sample
consisted of 480 participants. Of these, 291 were female (60.63%), 186 were
male (38.77%), and three chose the other option (0.63%). All were aged
between 18 and 65 (M =28.98 years, SD =10.66 years). As far as their level of
age age
education was concerned, 236 of them had a university degree (49.17%), 244
of them had finished high school degree or below (50.83%).
Materials and Procedure
In Study 4, the experimental design of 2 (feedback type: behavioral vs.
essentialist) × 2 (feedback content: inattention vs. forgetfulness) × 2
(competence of the supervisor: not competent vs. competent) was the same
as was conducted in Study 3.
Measures
Compared to Study 3, we modified the wording of the items to ensure
they measure both positive and negative effects of the feedback (e.g., “To
what extent would this feedback [1] improve / [2] worsen your relationship
with your supervisor?”).
Manipulation Checks
We used manipulation checks for the essentialist vs. behavioral
feedback type by using the item “According to the situation, what is your
supervisor's feedback focused on?” using a seven-point Likert scale ranging
between “1-Entirely on my personality” to “7-Entirely on my behavior”.
Then, the competence of the supervisor was assessed with the following
item: “According to the situation, what is your supervisor's feedback focused
on?” and provided their response on a six-point Likert scale ranging from
“1-Not competent at all” to “6-Fully competent”.
Outcome Measures
Items used in Study 4 much resembled the outcome item set of Study
3; however, in this case, participants were provided with a broader response
range (the scales for organizational commitment, relationship with the supervisor,
performance change, and motivation change were expanded from 5 to 7 points,
while for willingness to correct the mistake and willingness to seek professional
assistance, a 6-point scale was used that did not allow for a neutral "no affect"
response).
Outcome Measures. The manipulation check was followed by the
subsequent aspects and items: willingness to correct the mistake (“After this
feedback, to what extent do you intend to correct the mistake?” 1: I would
not intend to at all, 2: I would not intend to, 3: I would rather not intend to,
4: I would rather intend to, 5: I would intend to, 6: I would fully intend to),
willingness to seek professional assistance (“After this feedback, how likely do
you think it is that you would go to your supervisor with professional
questions?” 1: Not likely at all, 2: Not likely, 3: Rather not likely, 4: Rather
likely, 5: Likely, 6: Entirely likely), organizational commitment “How would
this feedback affect your commitment to the organization?” 1: It would
greatly reduce it, 2: It would reduce it, 3: It would rather reduce it, 4: It
wouldn’t affect it, 5: It would rather increase it, 6: It would increase it, 7: It
would greatly increase it), relationship with the supervisor (“How would this
feedback affect the relationship [with your supervisor]?” 1: It would greatly
worsen it, 2: It would worsen it, 3: It would rather worsen it, 4: It wouldn’t
affect it, 5: It would rather improve it, 6: It would improve it, 7: It would
greatly improve it), performance change (“How would this feedback affect
your performance?” 1: It would greatly worsen it, 2: It would worsen it, 3: It
would rather worsen it, 4: It wouldn’t affect it, 5: It would rather improve it,
6: It would improve it, 7: It would greatly improve it), and motivation change
(“How would this feedback affect your work motivation?” 1: It would greatly
reduce it, 2: It would reduce it, 3: It would rather reduce it, 4: It wouldn’t
affect it, 5: It would rather increase it, 6: It would increase it, 7: It would
greatly increase it), general emotions (“How would that feedback make you
feel?” 1: Very bad, 2: Bad, 3: Rather bad, 4: Indifferent, 5: Rather good, 6:
Good, 7: Very good) and rumination (“How much would you ruminate on
this feedback throughout the day?” 1: Not much, 2: Little, 3: Medium, 4: A
lot, 5: Always).
Data Analysis
In Study 4, we replicated the procedures implemented in Study 3, this
time utilizing the modified items mentioned in the Outcome Measures
section. Additionally, we explored the interaction between the feedback
type (behavioral vs. essentialist) and the supervisor's competence (not
competent vs. competent).

Our research question was related to the main effects of behavioral vs.

feedback content (inattention vs. forgetfulness) and the manipulated level of

who were provided with behavioral feedback, as opposed to the ones
provided with essentialist feedback, reported higher levels of performance-
related and emotional consequences. More specifically, behavioral (vs.

Discussion
The primary goal of Study 4 was to examine the robustness of Study 3
after controlling for the manipulated competency of the leader as well as
the content of the feedback with a more coherent and appropriate item set.
Similarly to the results of Study 3, we found that participants exposed to
behavioral feedback showed a higher propensity to seek professional
assistance, stronger organizational commitment, better relationship with
their supervisor, more positive emotions, higher post-feedback
performance, and work motivation compared to those receiving essentialist
feedback. Furthermore, we found a higher level of rumination on the
feedback which was not present in Study 3. This means that most of the
performance-related and emotional consequences showed a more adaptive
pattern in the case of behavior-focused feedback than personality-focused
feedback. In Study 5, the aim was to replicate these results in a well-
powered, preregistered study and examined the additive effects of the lack
of supervisor’s competence and behavioral feedback.
Study 5: A Preregistered Replication
In Study 5, we replicated the experimental design of Studies 3 and 4
with pre-registered hypotheses
hypothesized (H1) that essentialist feedback, compared to behavioral
feedback, would negatively impact performance-related outcomes in
employees (i.e., post-feedback performance, work motivation, supervisor
relationship, organizational commitment) and increase negative emotional
responses (i.e., rumination, general post-feedback feelings). Additionally,
the interaction between supervisor competence (competent vs. not
competent) and feedback type (essentialist vs. behavioral) was explored,
considering feedback content (inattention vs. forgetfulness) as a control
variable. Despite finding two significant interactions in Study 3 out of the
eight analyses, based on the results of Study 4, we anticipated that
essentialist feedback from a competent supervisor would more adversely
affect performance-related and emotional outcomes (H2).
Methods
Participants
Similarly to Study 4, for the 2×2×2 design with a d=0.30 effect size
(power=0.80, alpha=0.05, and three predictors), the suggested sample size
was 488 participants. A total of 1015 participants were recruited via social
media and from university courses. Exclusion criteria: informed consent was
not provided, or participant is under 18 (n=3), or sufficient data was not
provided (n=485). Therefore, the final sample consisted of 527 participants.
Of these, 336 were female (63.76%), 186 were male (35.29%), and five chose the
other option (0.95%). All were aged between 18 and 74 (M =28.87 years,
age
SD =11.17 years). As far as their level of education was concerned, 196 of them
age
had a college or university degree (37.19%), and 331 had high school or lower
(62.81%). A total of 377 (71.54%) were currently employed (n=153; 29,03%
unemployed). Among these participants, 326 worked as subordinates
(86.47%), 33 worked as middle managers (8.75%), and 15 worked as senior
managers (3.98%). 228 worked full-time (60.48%), 100 worked part-time
(26.53%), and 46 occasionally (12.20%).
Materials and Procedure
In Study 5, the experimental design of 2 (feedback type: behavioral vs.
essentialist) × 2 (feedback content: inattention vs. forgetfulness) × 2
(competence of the supervisor: not competent vs. competent) was identical
to the one used in Study 3 and Study 4.
Measures
In Study 5, the items from Study 4 were retained. However, two
validated measures were also added to explore the manipulations’ impact
on workplace engagement and work motivations.
Work Engagement Scale. The Hungarian version (Salamon et al.,
2022) of the ultra-short version of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale
(UWES-3, Schaufeli et al., 2019) was used to assess the level of work
engagement. The items and scale were slightly modified to relate more
directly to the effect of feedback. All items began with: “After this feedback,
to what extent would you...” while the items that represented the three core
dimensions of the scale with one item each were the following: vigor (“...feel
bursting with energy”), dedication (“...be enthusiastic about your job”), and
absorption (“...immerse yourself in your work”). Participants provided
responses on a seven-point Likert scale (1=not at all, 7=entirely). The scale
showed high internal consistency (α=0.81).
Work Motivation Scale. The Hungarian version (Kun et al., 2022) of
the Multidimensional Work Motivation Scale (MWMS; Gagné et al., 2015)
was used to measure three dimensions of work motivation. Slight
modifications were made to the instructions and item wording to better
reflect the context of the vignette. Accordingly, participants were asked to
consider the following: “After this feedback, for what reason would you
make efforts in your current job?” and were asked to indicate their
responses on a seven-point Likert scale (1=Not at all, 7=Completely). The
scale included the following dimensions of work motivation: intrinsic
motivation (three items; e.g., “I would make efforts... ..because I would have
fun doing my job”), social external regulation (three items; e.g., “I would
make efforts... ...to get others’ approval - e.g., supervisor, colleagues, family,
clients …”), and amotivation (three items; e.g., “I wouldn't make efforts,
because I would feel that I’m wasting my time at work”). The dimensions
showed high internal consistency (intrinsic motivation α=0.92, social
external regulation: α=0.76 amotivation: α=0.83, )
Manipulation Check
Participants responded to the item, “According to the situation, what
is your supervisor's feedback focused on?” using a seven-point Likert scale
(anchored at “1-Entirely on my personality” and “7-Entirely on my
behavior”) to differentiate between essentialist and behavioral feedback
types. Furthermore, the perceived competence of the supervisor was
assessed using the item, "According to the situation, how competent do you
perceive your supervisor?" Responses were recorded on a six-point Likert
scale, ranging from "1-Not competent at all" to "6-Fully competent".
Outcome Measures
We used the same items as in Study 4, along with validated work
engagement and motivational measures, to assess the potential effects of the
manipulations.
Data Analysis
In Study 5, the procedures implemented in Study 4 were replicated.
Results
The results of the manipulation check questions indicated that
behavioral (M =4.76, SD =1.55) feedback was more focused on the behavior
b b
than the essentialist (M =3.06, SD =1.47) feedback, b=1.70, t(1, 517)=12.86,
e e
p<0.001, d=0.98. In a similar vein, participants rated the competent
(M =4.64, SD =1.17) supervisor more competent than the incompetent

(M =2.56, SD =1.15) supervisor, b=2.08, t(1, 517)=20.46, p<0.001,
incompetent incompetent
d=1.33. Our analysis revealed no statistically significant baseline differences
between the conditions in terms of age, gender, level of education,
employment status, job level, employment type (all ps>0.565).
Our first research question was related to the main effects of
behavioral vs. essentialist feedback manipulation on the outcome variables
considering feedback content (inattention vs. forgetfulness) and the
manipulated level of perceived competence of the leader as covariates.
According to the results, participants who were provided with behavioral
feedback, as opposed to the ones provided with essentialist feedback, reported
higher probability of willingness to correct the mistake, b=0.34, t(3, 523)=3.49,
p<0.001, d=0.30; seeking professional assistance from their supervisor, b=0.58,
t(3,523)=5.68, p<0.000, d=0.42; stronger organizational commitment, b=0.67,
t(3,523)=7.70, p<0.001, d=0.62; better relationship with their supervisor,
b=0.62, t(3,523)=7.19, p<0.001, d=0.59; higher post-feedback performance,
b=0.55, t(3,523)=5.19, p<0.001, d=0.44; stronger post-feedback work
motivation, b=0.62, t(3,523)=5.29, p<0.001, d=0.44; more positive emotions,
b=0.29, t(3,523)=3.32, p<0.001, d=0.29; higher levels of rumination on the
feedback, b=-0.23, t(3,523)=-2.56, p<0.011, d=0.22.

Note. Error bars indicate standard errors. Covariates were feedback content
(inattention vs. forgetfulness) and the manipulated level of competence of the leader. *:
p<.05. **: p<.01. ***: p<.001.
In addressing the second research question, we explored the
interactions of feedback type with supervisor competence and feedback
content. Our analysis revealed no significant interaction effects on any
outcome variables (all ps > 0.222; see SM 4 for more details), except for
interaction between the feedback content and the essentialist vs. behavioral
feedback type, ß=-0.51, t(3,521)=-2.80, p=0.005. The difference is more
striking between the essentialist vs. behavioral conditions regarding the
“inattention” (EMM =3.08, SE=0.09; EMM =3.56, SE=0.09), than in
behavioral essentialist
the case of the “forgetfulness” (EMM =3.32, SE=0.09; EMM =3.32,
behavioral essentialist
SE=0.09) condition.
Besides the preregistered hypotheses, controlling for feedback type,
we observed a significant main effect of supervisor competence. This effect
was evident in various dimensions: willingness to correct the mistake, b=0.44,
t(3,523)=4.48, p<0.001, d=0.38; the likelihood of seeking professional assistance
from the supervisor, b=1.26, t(3,523)=12.39, p<0.001, d=0.93; organizational
commitment, b=0.45, t(3,523)=5.15, p<0.001, d=0.42; quality of the relationship
with the supervisor, b=0.37, t(3,523)=4.28, p<0.001, d=0.35; post-feedback
performance, b=0.39, t(3,523)=3.69, p<0.001, d=0.31; post-feedback work
motivation, b=0.50, t(3,523)=4.26, p<0.001, d=0.36; and rumination on the
feedback, b=0.41, t(3,523)=4.50, p<0.001, d=0.39. However, supervisor
competence did not significantly relate to post-feedback positive feelings
(p=0.57). These findings suggest that the detrimental impact of essentialist
feedback on performance-related outcomes may be exacerbated when the
supervisor is perceived as incompetent. Contrary to our expectations, this
effect is not interactive but additive in nature. The only exception to these
patterns was observed in relation to post-feedback general feelings.
Not Preregistered Exploratory Analyses
As it was the first attempt to add previously validated measures to the
item set that were adjusted to the present vignettes in a shortened form, we
wanted to explore the usefulness and psychometric appropriateness of
these brief measures. Our analysis showed that amotivation was increased
as the result of the essentialist feedback (EMM=3.14, SE=0.09) in contrast to
the behavioral one (EMM=2.67, SE=0.09), b=0.47, t(1, 504)=3.85, p<0.001,
d=0.34. Furthermore, results suggest that the essentialist feedback
(EMM=3.67, SE=0.07) could reduce work engagement more than the
behavioral one (EMM=4.11, SE=0.07), b=-0.44, t(1, 516)=-4.41, p<0.001, d=0.38.
However, no significant effect of the feedback type on intrinsic (p=0.25) and
extrinsic (p=0.44) work motivations was found.
Robustness verification
We also tested whether sociodemographic factors (age, gender, level
of education [without vs. with university degree], employment status
(employed vs. unemployed) might influence the effect of behavioral vs.
essentialist feedback both with and without controlling for the manipulated
competence (not competent vs. competent) of the supervisor or the content
of the feedback (inattention vs. forgetfulness). The negative effect of the
essentialist feedback (compared to the behavior-focused one) remained
significant on all outcome variables (all ps<0.009; for details, see SM 5).
Furthermore, employment status did not moderate the effect of the
essentialist vs. behavioral feedback type on any outcome variables (p=0.12).
Discussion
In Study 5, we replicated Study 4 with preregistered hypotheses
regarding the effects of personality vs. behavioral feedback on both
performance-related (seeking help, expected post-feedback performance,
work motivation, intention to correct the mistake, relationship with the
supervisor, organizational commitment) and emotional (rumination,
general feelings) consequences.
Similarly to the results of Study 3 and Study 4, we found that
participants in the behavioral feedback condition (compared to the
essentialist feedback condition) showed a more adaptive pattern in terms of
the post-feedback performance-related consequences and emotional
consequences. These relationships were independent of the perceived
competence of the supervisor, the adjective we used, and sociodemographic
variables like age, gender, education level, and employment status.
We also wanted to probe the possible interplay between the feedback
type, feedback content, and the competence of the supervisor who gives the
feedback. We found no interaction; however, the perceived competence of
the supervisor had a main effect on most of the outcome variables.
Participants exposed to feedback from a competent supervisor (compared
to a not competent supervisor) showed a stronger willingness to correct the
mistake, seek professional assistance from the supervisor, stronger
organizational commitment, post-feedback motivation, and expected
performance. They also rated more positively the quality of the
relationship with the supervisor and indicated a lower level of rumination.
These findings suggest that the detrimental impact of essentialist feedback
on performance-related outcomes may be exacerbated when the supervisor
is perceived as incompetent. This effect is not interactive but additive in
nature. The only exception to these patterns was observed in relation to
post-feedback general feelings, which was not influenced by the
supervisors’ competence level.
Finally, we had a few not preregistered analyses that supported the
above-mentioned results and can provide some initial external validity for
the outcome measures refined across Studies 2 and 5. We found that
essentialist feedback leads to a lower level of work engagement and stronger
amotivation; however, it leaves intact intrinsic and extrinsic motivations.
Therefore, essentialist feedback appears to influence the quantity (i.e.,
reduce the level) but not the quality of the work motivation (Lens et al.,
2010). These results suggest that neither essentialist nor behavioral feedback
can increase motivation. Still, essentialist feedback has a generally
detrimental role that reduces the quantity of motivation. In line with the
drop in work engagement, it appears that the essentialist feedback (in
contrast to behavioral one) contributes to the meaninglessness of the work.
Further research is needed to explore the reasons behind these patterns.

In Study 6, the goal was to investigate whether essentialist versus
behavioral feedback manifests in the spontaneous language use of
individuals who imagine themselves in a feedback scenario. We
hypothesized that people would naturally and spontaneously incorporate
essentialist versus behavioral language features when describing such a
scenario.
To test this hypothesis, participants read a scenario in which a
supervisor addresses an individual's inattentiveness during a meeting with
multiple employees. The feedback was framed either in essentialist terms
(e.g., “was inattentive”) or in behavioral terms (e.g., “did not pay attention”).
Additionally, colleagues in the scenario reinforced the feedback using either
essentialist or behavioral language.
Following this, participants were asked to imagine a situation in which
one colleague who did not participate in the meeting wanted to know what
had happened at the meeting. They were then instructed to describe the
situation in five sentences.
The primary outcome measure was the extent to which participants
used essentialist versus behavioral descriptions when recounting the
feedback incident. We controlled for individual differences in the
spontaneous use of essentialist versus behavioral language prior to the
manipulation to ensure that our results accurately reflected the impact of
the experimental conditions.
Methods
Participants
To determine the appropriate sample size for this study, a power
analysis using the pwr package (Champely et al., 2020) in R (version 4.4.2; R
Core Team, 2024) was conducted. The analysis was based on an anticipated
medium effect size (Cohen's d=0.30), with a desired power of 0.80 and an
alpha level of 0.05. Considering both the condition predictor (essentialist vs.
behavioral feedback) and a control variable (frequency of using essentialist
vs. behavioral language in the description of a neutral person prior to the
experimental manipulation), the analysis indicated that a total sample size
of 100 participants would be required to detect the expected effect with
adequate power. A total of 109 participants were assigned to one of the
conditions and replied to the subsequent questions. The requirement of the
participation was to have an active employment status. Of these
participants, 23.1% were female, and all were aged between 18 and 51
(M =22.7 years, SD =5.0 years). Regarding their level of education, 75.2%
age age
had finished high school (37.91%), and 24.8% had a university degree.
Participants received partial course credit for their participation.
Procedure
Participants were invited to take part in an online study about work-
related feedback situations. After completing a self-reported survey on their
work status and basic demographic data, we aimed to assess individual
differences in their spontaneous essentialist vs. behavior-focused
descriptions. They were requested to write three to five sentences about a
person whom they look up to, about someone who is an anti-hero for them,
and finally, about someone who is neutral to them. Based on Study 1,
people tend to use positive characteristics in an essentialist way and
negative ones in a behavioral way in a feedback situation. We opted for the
neutral description as a control variable that can indicate potential
individual differences in the spontaneous use of essentialist vs. behavioral
characteristics in a person-description task. We asked for three descriptions
as people found it easier to write a description of a “neutral” after the warm-
up of the description of a saliently positive role model and an anti-hero.
Then, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions
(behavioral-focused vs. essentialist-focused event sequences) in a vignette study.
In the vignettes, participants were requested to imagine themselves in a
situation where they overheard a conversation between a respected leader
of the organization and one of their colleagues who made a significant
mistake. In one of the conditions, the feedback was framed in an essentialist
way; in the other, it was behavior-focused. Then, the subordinate admitted
their mistake by repeating the leader’s feedback. Subsequently, participants
read about the conversations between colleagues within the organization
that they overheard throughout the day in the described situation. In these
conversations, the language used again, either essentialist or behavior-
Focused Feedback in Spontaneous Language Use
After reading the vignette, participants were requested to tell the story
to a friend using their own words with the following instructions: “After
lunch, you and a colleague who works in a different department, with whom you
have a good relationship and can talk to honestly and in a friendly manner about
company matters, sit down together in the café. They tell you that they heard
something serious happened and ask you, "Tell me what happened!" (You both sit in
a secluded booth in the café where no one else can hear you.) Please summarize what
happened in about five sentences in the text box below! What would you tell this
colleague with (with whom you have a friendly relationship) about what happened?
You can honestly share your thoughts about the situation and the colleague who
received the feedback. Use your own words, just as you would do it in a friendly
conversation!”
Measures
The main outcome measure was based on independent coders' ratings
of the spontaneous essentialist vs. behavior-focused language in their
descriptions of the feedback situation. The main control variable was the
rating of the independent coders on the spontaneous essentialist vs.
behavior-focused language use in the pre-experimental description of a
neutral person.
The language used in the vignette was gender- and age-neutral. After
participants wrote their description of the feedback situation, they were
asked to provide the gender, age, and leadership position of the imagined
superior (who gave the feedback) and the imagined colleague (who received
the feedback). The leadership position was rated on a four-point scale (1:
Employee - no subordinates; 2: Middle Management 1 - leader of non-
managerial staff; has a superior; 3: Middle Management 2 - leader of
managerial staff; has a superior; 4: Senior Management - leader at the highest
hierarchical level; has no superior).
Data Analysis
We developed a coding scheme to evaluate participants’ descriptions
of scenarios in the two conditions. Coders assessed the descriptions on a
five-point scale to determine whether they were more essentialist or
behavioral. On this scale, 1 indicated fully essentialist descriptions, focusing
on character traits and personality (e.g., "X is a good person"), while a score
of 5 indicated fully behavioral descriptions, emphasizing actions and
behaviors (e.g., "X yells at others"). Intermediate scores reflected a mix of
both types: a score of 2 indicated mainly essentialist descriptions with some
behavioral aspects, 3 represented an equal balance of essentialist and
behavioral descriptions, and 4 indicated mainly behavioral descriptions
with some essentialist aspects. Coders first determined if a description could
be categorized using this scale; if not, they noted it and proceeded to the
next entry. This systematic coding scheme provided a reliable measure of
the nature of participants' descriptions, serving as a crucial outcome
measure for our study. The interrater reliability for this coding scheme was
0.616, indicating a substantial level of agreement among coders and
supporting the robustness of the coding process. An aggregate code was
formed by averaging the codes of the two coders (in the case of neutral as
well as post-manipulation descriptions), and they were used in the
subsequent analyses.
After the coding, we used OLS regressions to predict spontaneous
language use in the narratives in which we controlled for the essentialist vs.
behavior-focused pre-experimental ratings of the neutral person, and in a
separate analysis, we also controlled for the gender, age, and level of
education of the participant, as well as the gender, age, and leadership
position of the imagined superior (who gave the feedback) and the
imagined colleague (who received the feedback).
Results
Based on the aggregated evaluation of the coders, the median rating
of the neutral description was 3 with a M=3.37 and a SD=1.28. These
descriptives suggest that there is considerable variability in the essentialist
vs. behavioral descriptions of a neutral person.
A multiple regression analysis was conducted to predict spontaneous
essentialist versus behavioral narratives about the feedback situation after
the manipulation while controlling for individual differences in using
essentialist vs. behavioral descriptions. Participants in the essentialist
condition (M=3.49, SE=0.15) used less behavioral description than in the
behavioral condition (M=4.51, SE=0.15), b=-1.01, t(109)=-4.79, p<0.001, d=1.00

Discussion
This study demonstrated significant variability in the tendency to use
essentialist versus behavioral language when describing a neutral individual.
However, exposure to a hypothetical scenario in which a colleague received
either essentialist or behavior-focused feedback could substantially shift
individuals' spontaneous language use and narratives in the direction of the
provided feedback type. Specifically, essentialist feedback led to more
essentialist language, whereas behavioral feedback resulted in more
behavioral language when discussing feedback situations. This vignette
study suggests that people spontaneously adopt essentialist versus
behavioral narratives about feedback situations, potentially reinforcing the
existing culture of essentialist versus behavior-focused feedback within the
organization. Even in this vignette, when constraints are very low compared
to a real behavioral setup in the laboratory (or in the field), the visible
individual differences in using behavioral and essentialist language
disappear when participants are exposed to an essentialist vs. behavior-
focused environment, and they are requested to form narratives. It not only
demonstrates the power of the situation over individual differences but also
the potential to carry out social psychological interventions that can prevent
essentialist feedback. However, the question arises whether behavioral
feedback is the royal way of giving feedback or whether there are other,
even more effective approaches.
General Discussion
Although the organizational field focused less on these aspects, there
was another rising research domain relevant in the introduction of this
field: assessing the efficacy of common and popular performance
improvement techniques that are called work-related personality-feedback
interventions (PFI; see Jelley, 2021). Personality-Feedback Interventions
refer to structured processes where individuals receive feedback based on
personality assessments. These interventions often aim to enhance self-
awareness, guide development, and improve performance by offering
insights into personal behavioral patterns and suggesting action plans for
growth (see Kluger & DeNisi, 1996). These interventions are very lucrative
business practices. Annually, millions engage in personality inventories for
personal development, contributing to an industry valued at hundreds of
millions, possibly accounting for 40% of its worth (Moyle & Hackston, 2018;
Zickar & Kostek, 2013). Specifically, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator
(MBTI) segment alone is estimated at a higher value of $2 billion (Emre,
2019; Lundgren et al., 2017). For example, in MBTI’s Personality Application
Matrix, individuals’ self is categorized in pseudo-scientific discrete clusters
without using the graduality of scales. We could mention other tests, like
DISC, Hogan Assessment, or Emotional Intelligence Assessment. These tests
have a rentable business model, but the theoretical basis of their underlying
constructs and their validity is questionable (Martinussen et al., 2001).
However, we claim that these are negligible issues if we consider the long-
term negative consequences of their direct and robust feedback on the
respondents’ personalities. Fortunately, earlier and present reviews
forewarn HR experts about the potential adverse effects of Personality-
Feedback Interventions (see Jelley, 2021; Kluger & DeNisi, 1996).
One might think that there is an abundance of organizational
empirical research supporting organizational practices of giving behavioral
feedback (e.g., “you did not pay attention”) over personality feedback (e.g., “you
are an inattentive person”). This is not the case. Instead, personality feedback
interventions flourish by using popular and psychometrically questionable
survey methods (e.g., MBTI, DISC, etc.) that inherently promote
personality-based feedback and use outdated typologies which oversimplify
personality perception as well as potentially limit employees’ learning and
growth trajectories. The present work is among the first that aimed to
explore the potential psychological consequences of giving personality-
oriented vs. behavioral feedback. Across four studies, we demonstrated that
personality feedback has detrimental performance-related and affective
consequences. We also demonstrated that these results are robust and stand
still independently from employment or sociodemographic status, the
competence of the supervisor, and the content of the feedback (i.e.,
inattention vs. forgetfulness).
This work also revealed how feedback styles affect not only
performance outcomes but also how narratives about feedback spread
within organizational contexts. Study 6 demonstrated significant variability
in the tendency to use essentialist versus behavioral language when
describing a neutral individual. However, exposure to a hypothetical
scenario in which a colleague received either essentialist or behavior-
focused feedback could substantially shift individuals' spontaneous
language use and narratives in the direction of the type of feedback given.
This finding suggests that feedback styles not only shape immediate
reactions but may also influence the broader organizational culture through
the adoption of consistent linguistic patterns.
In summary, these findings highlight the dual impact of feedback
styles: direct effects on individual outcomes (e.g., motivation, performance,
emotional well-being) and indirect effects on organizational culture
through the spread of language and narratives. Nevertheless, it is worth
questioning whether behavioral feedback represents the royal road to
effective feedback or whether alternative methods, such as modeling,
mentoring, or collaborative feedback, might yield even greater benefits by
reducing emotional costs and fostering learning.

Theoretical Contribution
In social psychology, 40 years ago, Weiner (1985) has already claimed
that if one attributes a behavior (e.g., a setback or mistake) to an internal,
stable, and uncontrollable characteristic (e.g., personality), it can have
detrimental motivational and emotional consequences regarding the
expectations of success and therefore the future motivation. In parallel,
Seligman (1972) added globality to the stable internal attribution of a
negative event (e.g., setback) that led to learned helplessness. Dweck built on
these theories when establishing the implicit theories of intelligence (later
intelligence mindsets) theory and supposed that people could form implicit
theories about abstract concepts like intelligence. People with a fixed
intelligence mindset see their intellectual capacities as stable characteristics.
In contrast, people with a growth mindset perceive their intelligence as a
malleable characteristic that can be improved by making efforts, choosing
adaptive strategies, and asking for help from competent persons (Dweck,
1987).
Mueller and Dweck’s positive feedback experiment (1998)
demonstrated that praising internal stable characteristics can lead to
detrimental motivational and performance effects. However, from a
theoretical perspective, one of the common denominators in these studies
was related to the feedback referring to “stable and internal characteristics”.
Despite these authors (Weiner, Seligman, Dweck) and these studies being
seminal textbook examples, in organizational psychology, it appears that
these attributional theories are dealt with as “terra incognita.” Nevertheless,
this field systematically examines the “mixed” effects of the so-called
personality feedback interventions (Jelley, 2021; Kluger & DeNisi, 1996)
ignoring classic chapters of any social psychological textbooks on
attribution theories.
For these reasons, the theoretical contribution of the present paper is
rather modest. We do not demonstrate a new phenomenon; we simply
found some experimental evidence to demonstrate the negative
consequences of generating stable and internal attributions behind a
setback. For instance, Weiner’s theory provides an explanation for our
results in Study 2. In this case, the setback was attributed to an internal (i.e.,
being tired is an internal characteristic), unstable (i.e., after sleeping,
tiredness can disappear; therefore, it is not set in stone) in time, and
controllable (i.e., one can control when to take a break to be more vigilant)
reason (e.g., “You behaved inattentively as you must have been tired”) helps the
most in maintaining motivation and positive emotions in future tasks. We
assume that the huge difference between the essentialist and the “good-
excuse-enhanced behavior-focused” feedback is striking because the latter
can eliminate the threat completely. Receiving essentialist feedback on
one’s setback not only diminishes the chance of future success but also
creates a threat to self-esteem, activating certain avoidance strategies (e.g.,
self-handicapping).
Another theoretical contribution might be related to the examination
of feedback content. Dweck used positive feedback. As Study 1 shows,
essentialist feedback is present in a broad range of positive and negative
dimensions. There is a solid tendency (more than 60% of the cases) to
provide more essentialist feedback on positive characteristics (clever,
intelligent, smart) than on negative characteristics (aggressive, disrespectful,
and selfish, less than 30% of the cases). It appears that people do not have to
be afraid of threatening another person’s self by giving them essentialist
positive feedback. In contrast, essentialist negative feedback can appear as a
serious threat. In sum, essentialist negative feedback is more threatening as
the result of its uncontrollable, stable, internal nature. The threat gets
stronger as the negative valence of the characteristic increases; for example,
it is more threatening to be aggressive than inattentive. This might be the
reason why people tend to use less personality feedback on negative
characteristics. This might also be the reason behind the Study 2 effects we
discussed earlier regarding the “good-excuse-enhanced behavioral focus,”
in which the excuse eliminates the uncontrollable, stable, internal nature of
the attribution. Finally, in the workplace context, the threat is not only
related to self-esteem, but such feedback might pose long-term existential
threats as well. For example, in terms of not getting a promotion or
increasing the chance of being laid off. If the supervisor has stable
attributions of one’s negative characteristics and he makes it evident to the
subordinate in the form of personality-focused feedback, the employee
might reasonably view their workplace prospects as relatively poor. Unlike
the outdated and empirically not proven theory of Jung (see Jung & Beebe,
2016), which is one of the scientific bases of the Personality-Feedback
Interventions (McCauley, 2000), the mindset theory of Dweck can be much
more beneficial in an organizational context.
Study 6 further enriches this theoretical understanding by
highlighting how feedback styles not only influence individual perceptions
and outcomes but also shape linguistic patterns and narratives. These
findings bridge attribution theories with organizational communication,
showing how essentialist feedback can perpetuate a culture of fixed
mindsets, while behavior-focused feedback may foster a culture of
adaptability. The power of situational factors to override individual
differences in linguistic tendencies, as demonstrated in Study 6, provides
evidence for how social psychological interventions could mitigate the
spread of essentialist language and, by extension, fixed attributions in
organizations.
Applied Contributions
Even though feedback type appears to be a fundamental question that
can potentially influence organizational climate, after carrying out a
thorough literature research, we did not find comparable data for
organizational context. When applying these findings to daily management
practices, it becomes evident that behavioral feedback yields more positive
outcomes than personality feedback in a variety of workplace scenarios.
Firstly, our research suggests that personality feedback negatively impacts
motivation, performance, and emotional states. Consequently, managers
are advised to eschew this type of feedback. Secondly, Study 2 indicates that
incorporating external unstable attributions into feedback, such as
suggesting “you might have been tired,” enhances its effectiveness, leading
to greater willingness to correct mistakes and improve post-feedback
performance. Additionally, Study 5 reveals that perceived supervisor
incompetency combined with essentialist feedback has detrimental effects,
whereas behavioral feedback from a competent leader is beneficial for
workplace performance and emotional well-being.
Study 6 extends these applied implications by showing how feedback
style influences organizational language use. Essentialist feedback leads to
narratives that reinforce fixed traits, potentially entrenching a culture where
setbacks are seen as inherent and unchangeable. Behavioral feedback, on
the other hand, promotes language emphasizing controllable and
situational factors, which could foster a culture of growth and adaptability.
Managers could use these insights to design communication training
programs aimed at reducing the use of essentialist language and
encouraging behavior-focused narratives in their teams.
If the adverse impact of personality feedback is evident in specific
workplace situations, as our vignettes suggest, it likely holds true for
broader feedback programs that focus on employee personality traits (e.g.,
DISC, MBTI). To illustrate, essentialist feedback can be likened to a drop of
toxic chemicals in a glass of water—harmful but limited. In contrast,
comprehensive personality feedback programs are comparable to pouring
an entire bottle of this toxin into a river, exacerbating the damage
extensively. This analogy highlights how such programs can significantly
and adversely affect employee growth and the overall work culture,
similarly to widespread environmental pollution.
However, before advocating for a shift towards behavior-focused
feedback based on the above insights, it is prudent to consider the overall
effectiveness of direct feedback methods. Do these forms of feedback
represent the optimal approach for learning and correcting mistakes? Our
findings suggest that even with behavioral feedback, the relationship
between supervisor and employee may not improve much, and such
feedback often incurs affective costs, including the lack of positive
emotions, high levels of rumination, and low levels of motivation for
seeking professional guidance. It is possible that people living in a culture
where personality feedback is often used can interpret behavioral feedback
that refers to their personality. An employee who hears “Why don’t you use
your brain?” might interpret this sentence as personality feedback related to
their interpersonal attributes and not a call for making more effort to use
their intellectual capacities.
Although direct feedback can swiftly identify work-related issues,
there are less direct, more constructive approaches, such as modeling,
mentoring, and collaboration, that can preempt and rectify workplace
errors. These methods, by demonstrating best practices and offering gentle
guidance like “Why don’t you try it this way…” or “Let’s check it out together…”,
can mitigate the negative effects associated with direct feedback. We
supposed this as based on the pretests, in the aftermath of feedback
sessions, participants commonly reported negative emotions, such as
disappointment, humiliation, shame, anxiety, anger, and a sense of
incompetence, which were more pronounced following essentialist
feedback, but still present in behavioral ones, as well. Future studies might
explore the potential benefits of the above-mentioned methods as an
alternative of these more direct methods.
Limitations
This study is not without its limitations. First of all, we requested
participants to respond to a hypothetical scenario instead of placing them
into a real situation in which we could have assessed their actual behavior.
Second, although we refined the outcome measures across the studies, they
were self-reported; therefore, future studies might use behavioral measures.
Third, we examined these effects in one cultural context. In future studies,
it might be examined outside the Central Eastern European context. Fourth,
we examined the potential role of a limited number of situational factors
(e.g., competence of the leader); however, other characteristics of the leader
(e.g., warmth, autonomy support, charisma, etc.) might also potentially
moderate the effect of behavioral vs. personality feedback on performance-
related and emotional outcomes. It is also possible that in threatening
situations, supervisors might use more personality-related negative
feedback and subordinates accept this feedback with less negative
consequences in comparison with less threatening situations. It is also
possible that the recipients’ temporal (e.g., mood) or more stable
characteristics (e.g., persistence) can influence the responses to the
behavioral and personality feedback (see Lechermeier & Fassnacht, 2018
).
Future studies should examine the situational factors which can promote
and legitimize personality-oriented negative feedback. Finally, although the
studies used hypothetical scenarios, the results suggest that interventions
helping supervisors to avoid personality-related feedback might be useful.
Conclusion
Personality-related negative feedback is something that supervisors
are supposed to avoid. The present work was the first that demonstrated the
large contrast between behavioral and personality-related feedback on
performance and affect. However, negative feedback is a relatively sterile
message in a formal workplace or school context and not necessarily the
best way to pave the way for learning. Future studies might focus on more
organic forms of correcting mistakes, such as providing a role model or
mentoring. It is possible that in close and active collaborations, working
together continuously can contribute more to shaping the behavior of
subordinates than providing feedback. For example, in small workshops,
such as guilds, where more experienced colleagues support and teach the
younger ones the intricacies of their craft over the years, the classic, formal
negative feedback is less important. In contrast, in the industrial production
world, where time is limited and coworkers spend less time together,
feedback mechanisms tend to be the norm.
