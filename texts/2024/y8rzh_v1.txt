Abstract
This study examines public perceptions of the Ukraine war, focusing on Russian attitudes toward
its economic and political impacts compared to other countries. Drawing on theoretical
perspectives such as the Spiral of Silence and collective action constraints, this research explores
how sociopolitical context shapes public opinion in an authoritarian country. Using cross-national
survey data, the analysis reveals significant differences in war-related assessments. Despite severe
economic repercussions, many Russians report optimism about the war’s effects, especially on
economic growth, diverging from the prevalent concerns in neighboring nations. Key factors such
as gender, education, region of residence, institutional trust, and media consumption explain the
heterogeneity in these perceptions. The findings underscore the role of individual characteristics,
regional contexts, and institutional trust in sustaining public support for conflict in complex
sociopolitical environments, contributing to broader discussions on national contexts and public
attitudes in wartime.

Introduction
The war Russia unleashed in February 2022 caused unprecedented devastation in Ukraine, but it
also had significant implications for Russia, Europe, and the broader global economy and
geopolitics (Martsenyuk et al., 2024). Ukraine has suffered immense loss of life, displacement of
millions, and destruction of infrastructure, creating a humanitarian crisis of extraordinary
magnitude not seen in Europe since World War II (Haque et al., 2022; Shaw, 2023). The Russian
invasion has decimated Ukrainian cities, disrupted critical agricultural production, and triggered an
ongoing social, economic, and political crisis. Beyond Ukraine, European countries have faced
severe economic fallout, including inflationary pressures exacerbated by rising energy prices, as
many nations, particularly those heavily reliant on Russian gas and oil, scrambled to adjust their
energy supplies (Gugushvili and Präg, 2024; Zhang et al., 2024). Neighboring countries, such as
Poland, Moldova, and the Baltic states, have borne the brunt of refugee inflows, straining public
services and social infrastructures (Maidanik, 2023).
The war has significantly damaged Russia in terms of its economic development and
political stability (Gould-Davies, 2023; Stoner, 2022). Economically, Russia has been facing the
severe impact of international sanctions, leading to inflation, currency devaluation, and disruptions
in trade and technology transfers (Liadze et al., 2023). The sanctions, imposed by Western countries
and multilateral organizations, have targeted key sectors such as banking, defense, and energy,
crippling Russia's ability to engage in international commerce (Tong, 2024). The loss of European
markets for oil and gas, Russia’s main revenue sources, has forced the country to seek new trade
partners, most notably China and India, but at reduced prices and under less favorable terms (Iqbal
and Rahman, 2023). Additionally, capital flight and the exodus of educated professionals fleeing
the country’s uncertain future have damaged Russia's long-term development prospects (Hanson
and Baltabayeva, 2024). Politically, the war has undermined Russia’s internal stability. While
President Vladimir Putin initially consolidated power through nationalistic rhetoric, the prolonged
conflict, coupled with the mobilization of conscripts, has created internal pressures (Pattison,
2024).
At the start of the war, there were visible protests in Russia against the unprovoked
aggression, particularly in major cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg. However, these protests
were quickly suppressed through various channels of state control. Drawing on sociological
perspectives like Noelle-Neumann’s (1974) Spiral of Silence, it is evident that the Russian
government has successfully stifled dissent by fostering an atmosphere of fear and repression. The
regime’s authoritarian control over the media has been central in shaping public perception,
presenting the war as a defensive necessity against the West (Gugushvili and Reeves, 2021; Oleinik
and Paniotto, 2024). The state has crafted a narrative that frames dissent as unpatriotic, further
silencing opposition. Moreover, punitive measures such as arrests, imprisonment, and heavy fines
have dissuaded many from participating in public protests, enforcing a high cost for visible
opposition. Those who might privately oppose the war are likely to remain silent out of fear of
reprisal, thereby reinforcing the appearance of public consensus in support of the government’s
stance (Kizilova and Norris, 2024).
Despite the critical importance of understanding individuals’ worldviews on the matters
related to the war in Ukraine, there is a lack of comparative data on how individuals in Russia and
other countries assess the war’s impact on their countries' future prospects. The unique nature of
Russia’s involvement in the conflict makes this question even more relevant, as the Russian
population is directly affected by both the war’s material and psychological costs. The central
expectation of this study is that, due to the war’s significant and far-reaching consequences, the
Russian population is expected to be more concerned about the war’s implications than populations
in other countries. Given the massive economic sanctions, disruptions in daily life, and political
instability, it is reasonable to expect that Russians, on average, will express higher levels of concern
than their counterparts in other nations less directly affected by the war, despite a highly repressive
political environment.
Furthermore, the second set of expectations this study has is that despite the government’s
suppression of anti-war dissent in Russia, there is heterogeneity in perceptions of the effect of the
war by individuals’ socio-demographic and ideological factors such as gender, institutional trust,
and media consumption. For instance, women, often more focused on social welfare and risk
aversion, are more likely to view the war negatively, while younger individuals, especially in urban
areas with greater access to diverse media sources, tend to be more critical. In contrast, older
populations and rural residents, who rely more heavily on state-controlled media and economic
subsidies, tend to show higher support for the government. Education and employment further
shape views, with those more educated or in sectors affected by sanctions being more critical, while
workers in state-linked industries often support the war. Nationalism, trust in political institutions,
and media consumption also play a role, as trust in the president and reliance on state media can
increase support for the war. In contrast, access to independent media might foster skepticism.
These factors can collectively explain the variation in how different groups perceive the
consequences of the war on Russia.
This study aims to address the main research questions by analyzing individual assessments
of the war's impact within Russia and across other countries by making use of recently collected
comparative survey data. By comparing war-related positive and negative assessments across
countries, we first reveal a paradox of Russians’ optimism despite being at the center of the ongoing
war and then explore in detail individual-level predictors of positive and negative assessments of
the impact of war on Russia’s economic growth and political stability.
Background
The consequences of the war outside of Ukraine
The war in Ukraine, triggered by Russia’s invasion, has unleashed severe economic and
geopolitical consequences not just for the countries directly involved but for the world as a whole.
The global economy, already fragile after the pandemic, has faced additional shocks, particularly
in the energy and food sectors (Snow, 2023). Russia and Ukraine have been key players in global
energy and agricultural markets. As the world’s second-largest natural gas producer and one of the
largest wheat exporters, Russia’s invasion and subsequent sanctions have triggered energy price
hikes and disruptions in the food supply chain. European Union countries, which had been heavily
dependent on Russian energy imports, saw prices for natural gas and oil soar, leading to increased
inflation and lower gross domestic product (GDP) growth across the continent (Liadze et al., 2023)
. Germany and other major economies were particularly vulnerable due to their reliance on Russian
gas, and their economies experienced significant strain as they scrambled to secure alternative
energy sources.
Beyond its economic effects, the war has reshaped the geopolitical landscape. In Europe,
the invasion catalyzed a political response that further isolated Russia from the world stage while
strengthening alliances within the European Union and The North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO). Finland and Sweden's accession to NATO is a prime example of how the war has realigned
European security interests (Forsberg, 2023). At the same time, European countries, while
maintaining a unified stance on sanctions against Russia, have also increased their defense budgets,
reflecting a broader concern over regional stability and future conflicts. The war has led to
heightened fears in countries like Moldova and Georgia, both of which have historically been
vulnerable to Russian political influence and aggression.
The war has also led to a restructuring of Russia’s internal economy, as sanctions from
Western nations and a shift toward a war economy have taken hold. In 2022, Russia’s GDP
experienced a 4.5% contraction due to these sanctions, particularly in sectors that depend on
international trade and access to advanced technologies. However, the Russian economy saw some
resilience owing to its continued energy exports, primarily oil and natural gas, providing a financial
buffer. Nonetheless, the long-term prognosis continuous to be bleak, with Russia expected to
experience a sustained economic decline due to its isolation from Western markets and
technological ecosystems, as well as the heavy government expenditures related to the war effort
(Gorodnichenko et al., 2024).
Russia’s domestic population is likely to feel the effects of the war more acutely than those
in many other countries. Although state-controlled media has successfully maintained high levels
of public support for the war in some segments of the population, the economic reality paints a
much more challenging picture (Semenenko et al., 2024). Increased military spending has come at
the expense of other sectors, and sanctions have crippled Russia’s ability to modernize key
industries or access critical imports like semiconductors. This has resulted in a sharp decline in
manufacturing output, exacerbating the economic difficulties already facing the country. For the
Russian public, rising inflation and wage stagnation, combined with a shrinking labor market, have
led to a deterioration in living standards, particularly in urban centers where dissatisfaction with
the war and the government’s handling of the economy is more pronounced (Tian et al., 2023).
Compared to other nations, Russia’s population is uniquely positioned to bear the brunt of
the war’s long-term economic and political fallout. While European countries have been able to
mitigate some of the worst effects through emergency measures and alternative supply chains,
Russia remains heavily restricted by international sanctions and its exclusion from global financial
markets. Moreover, the country’s growing political isolation has limited its ability to attract foreign
investment or leverage global partnerships that could alleviate economic pressures. Over time, this
is expected to deepen the economic divide between Russia and other global economies, leaving its
population more vulnerable to economic instability and political repression (Liadze et al., 2023).
While the Russian government continues to frame the conflict as a necessary defense of national
interests, the social and economic costs are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore for large
population segments (Semenenko et al., 2024).
Explanations for the Lack of Protests and Dissent in Russia
The lack of widespread visible opposition to the war in Ukraine among the Russian population,
despite substantial human, economic, social, and political costs, can be explained through several
interrelated theoretical perspectives. The Spiral of Silence theory, as proposed by Elisabeth Noelle-
Neumann (1974), is particularly relevant in understanding this phenomenon. In authoritarian
regimes like Russia, individuals are less likely to express dissenting views when they believe they
are in the minority or fear social isolation. This effect is amplified by state-controlled media, which
consistently portrays the war as a necessary defensive action against Western aggression. The
Russian government, through its tightly controlled media environment, has succeeded in fostering
an atmosphere where the dominant narrative is one of support for the war (Alyukov, 2024). As a
result, those with opposing views may choose to remain silent, creating a self-reinforcing cycle
where dissent is both socially and legally dangerous. In this environment, the visible absence of
protest strengthens the perception that the majority supports the war, further discouraging those
with contrary views from speaking out (Kolesnikov, 2022; NORC, 2024).
Additionally, the authoritarian resilience framework explains how the Russian state
maintains its grip on power through a combination of repression and control over civil society.
Putin’s regime has mastered the art of silencing potential opposition by stifling independent media,
suppressing political protests, and enacting laws that punish dissent (Javeline and Lindemann-
Komarova, 2020). Through various forms of coercion, such as imprisonment, financial penalties,
or the threat of job loss, the state effectively deters mass mobilization against its policies. The
severe penalties imposed on protesters, combined with Russia’s extensive surveillance apparatus,
ensure that citizens are aware of the risks associated with voicing opposition. This results in what
can be described as "fear-induced passivity," where the population may harbor grievances but
refrain from taking action due to the risks involved (Matovski, 2023). Furthermore, millions of
Russians depend on the state for their livelihoods, creating a direct link between economic stability
and political acquiescence. This economic dependency further reinforces political loyalty, as
individuals fear that opposing the regime could threaten their financial well-being (Berls Jr, 2021).
Moreover, the Russian government has actively mobilized nationalist rhetoric to garner
support for the war, tapping into deeply ingrained sentiments of patriotism and anti-Westernism.
Nationalism and the construction of an external enemy are crucial components of Putin’s strategy
to secure public support. By framing the war as a struggle for Russia’s survival against NATO and
Western imperialism, the state has galvanized a portion of the population into actively supporting
the war (Tolz and Hutchings, 2023). This ideological mobilization ensures that loyalty to the state
is not just passive but often demonstrative, with citizens being encouraged and sometimes coerced
into showing public support for the war. In schools and workplaces, citizens are expected to
participate in symbolic acts of loyalty, such as public displays of the “Z” symbol, which has become
associated with support for the "special military operation" (Yekelchyk, 2022). This creates a social
environment where dissent is not only discouraged but also equated with treason, making it more
difficult for the opposition to gain traction (Kuznetsova, 2024).
The collective action problem offers another explanation for why mass opposition has not
materialized, even though the war is imposing significant economic and social costs. As articulated
by Mancur Olson Jr. (1971), individuals in authoritarian regimes may hesitate to engage in
collective protest because they believe their personal involvement will have little impact,
particularly given the high personal risks involved. In Russia, the government has effectively
fragmented opposition movements, preventing the formation of unified resistance. This
fragmentation, combined with the severe penalties for dissent, leads to a situation where individuals
prefer to wait for others to act first, resulting in widespread inaction despite dissatisfaction. The
lack of strong civil society institutions and opposition groups further exacerbates this problem, as
there are few avenues for collective organization against the government’s war policies (Sundstrom
et al., 2022).
Heterogeneity and individual-level explanations
Based on the discussion in the previous section, the absence of widespread opposition to the war
in Russia, despite its enormous costs, is likely to be the product of a multifaceted system of control
that includes fear, repression, economic dependency, ideological mobilization, and collective action
challenges. Yet, the lack of mass protests and opposition to the war does not mean that the Russian
population is homogenous in its assessment of the implications of the war on the country. In
addition to comparing positive and negative perceptions with other countries, in the present study,
we examine how individual socio-demographic and ideological characteristics are linked to
perceptions of the war’s impact on economic and political outcomes. Due to the lack of data, there
are virtually no studies that compare public opinion between Russia and other countries concerning
the economic and political consequences of the war. There has also been little examination of
heterogeneity of perceptions of the impact of the war by individuals’ characteristics.
Demographic traits such as gender, age, and marital status can play an important role in
shaping attitudes toward the war. Research suggests that women are generally more risk-averse and
often prioritize social welfare and peace over conflict, which could explain why they may be more
likely to view the war as having negative economic and political consequences. For instance,
Inglehart and Norris (2003) argue that women tend to express greater concern for stability,
particularly in times of crisis, due to their roles in family and economic security. Age is another
significant factor; younger individuals, particularly those in urban areas, are typically more exposed
to diverse media sources and may be less reliant on state-controlled narratives, making them more
critical of the war. In contrast, older populations may exhibit greater loyalty to nationalistic policies,
where older individuals tend to hold more conservative and state-supportive views (Gugushvili and
Kabachnik, 2019; Twenge, 2006). Marital status is another variable that can affect perspectives.
Some family sociologists, such as Gerson (2010), highlight how economic insecurities and social
networks shaped by marital status can influence political opinions.
In examining rural-urban and regional differences, it is important to note the significant role
that geography plays in shaping political attitudes (Gugushvili et al., 2015). In Russia, rural
populations often rely heavily on state-controlled media, which amplifies pro-war narratives and
increases support for the government (Grek, 2023). Rural regions are more likely to exhibit high
levels of trust in state institutions, including the military, given their reliance on state resources and
economic subsidies. Rural populations are more likely to support the status quo due to their
economic dependency on the government (Hirschman, 1970). Urban populations, particularly in
large cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg, have greater access to alternative media sources, which
might expose them to more critical perspectives on the war. These urban regions are also more
likely to experience the direct economic effects of sanctions, making them more skeptical of the
government’s actions. Similarly, regional differences within Russia, particularly between
economically vulnerable areas and those benefiting from state investments in sectors like military
and energy, may further explain the variation in public opinion. As Agnew (1994) noted in his
political geography study, regions tied economically to state-led industries are more likely to
support state policies, including those related to war.
Education and employment are variables potentially also influencing public opinion on the
consequences of war. Individuals with higher levels of education tend to access independent news
sources and engage in critical thinking, making them less susceptible to government propaganda.
This is consistent with Lipset’s (1960) assertion that education increases political engagement and
democratic values, leading to more skepticism about authoritarian regimes and their policies. Those
with university degrees may be more aware of the long-term economic and political risks posed by
the war, particularly regarding economic sanctions and international isolation (Tomz and Weeks,
2020). Employment status also plays a significant role, as those employed in state-linked industries,
such as the military and energy sectors, may support the war due to their reliance on state resources.
Conversely, individuals in sectors hit hardest by sanctions, such as technology and manufacturing,
are likely to experience direct economic hardships, leading them to view the war more negatively.
Nationalism and attitudes toward democracy further complicate public perceptions of the
war’s impact. Nationalistic sentiments, which the Russian government has effectively promoted,
can lead individuals to view the war as a necessary defense of Russian sovereignty against Western
aggression. This aligns with Anderson’s (1991) work on nationalism, which emphasizes how
national identity can be mobilized to support state actions during conflicts. In contrast, those with
stronger democratic values may be more critical of the authoritarian tactics used by the Russian
government, including its suppression of dissent and control over media. Research on democratic
engagement suggests that individuals who value democratic norms are less likely to support
military interventions that threaten civil liberties and democratic institutions (Dalton, 2008).
Finally, trust in political institutions, including trust in the president and the military, can be
an important factor in shaping public perceptions of the war. Individuals who trust President Putin
and the Russian military are more likely to view the war as justified and believe it will lead to
positive outcomes for Russia. Hetherington (2005) argued that trust in political institutions plays a
central role in shaping public support for government actions, particularly during crises.
Conversely, those who distrust these institutions are more likely to perceive the war as a threat to
Russia’s economic and political future. Media consumption also significantly influences attitudes,
as those who primarily consume state-controlled media might be more inclined to accept the
government’s framing of the war, while those who access independent or foreign media may hold
more critical views. The cultivation theory explains how prolonged exposure to state narratives can
shape individuals’ perceptions of reality, especially in contexts where the media is tightly controlled
by the state (Morgan et al., 2014).
To summarize, this study aims to compare the perceptions of the impact of war on economic
and political outcomes in Russia and other countries and to explore how individual socio-
demographic and ideological characteristics such as gender, age, education, trust in institutions,
media consumption, and regional differences, among others, explain the variation in attitudes
toward the consequences of the war in Ukraine. By examining these research questions, we seek to
provide a better understanding of public opinion on the war, both within Russia and comparatively,
offering insights into the context of Russia that drives support or opposition to the war in Ukraine.
Research design
Data
The fourth wave of the Life in Transition Survey (LITS IV), commissioned by the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), is a large-scale, cross-national survey designed to
capture the views and experiences of individuals across 37 countries. The survey was conducted
from October 2022 through 2023 and involved a total of 37,489 face-to-face interviews across the
following participating countries: Albania, Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Jordan,
Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyz Republic, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Moldova, Mongolia,
Montenegro, Morocco, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovak Republic,
Slovenia, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Türkiye, Uzbekistan, and West Bank and Gaza. The survey
population targeted adults aged 18 and over living in private households, and sampling was
designed to ensure national representativeness. Random probability sampling was used in most
countries, while in a few countries, quota sampling and individual and address registers were
employed. Interviews were conducted in person at respondents' homes, and all data were collected
using Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI). A multi-stage, stratified sampling design
was employed, with Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) selected to reflect the regional and urban-
rural population distribution within each country. More details about the LITS IV, including the
response rates in all countries, are available in the technical report (Ipsos, 2024).
In the country of our primary interest, Russia, data collection was conducted from
November 3, 2022, to December 19, 2022, amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine, with a total of 1,017
completed face-to-face interviews. A random walk sampling method was employed to select
households, ensuring randomness and representativeness across the country, and respondents were
then chosen within households using an Electronic Contact Sheet (ECS) system. The survey
maintained a strict methodological approach to ensure national representativeness despite the
challenging political environment. Although conducted during a time of heightened political
tension due to Russia's involvement in the war, the survey followed rigorous standards to collect
unbiased data on public attitudes toward various economic, political, and social issues. However,
the broader political context may have influenced how respondents answered certain sensitive
questions, particularly those related to political stability and trust in institutions.
Attitudes toward the implications of the war
For estimating attitudes towards the implications of the war in Ukraine, all respondents in Russia
and elsewhere were asked the following question: “How, if at all, do you think the war in Ukraine
will impact the following?” (a) Economic growth in [respective country] and (b) Political stability
in [respective country]”. The answer options included: “very negative impact,” “somewhat
negative impact,” “no impact,” “somewhat positive impact,” and “very positive impact.” We
combined two negative and two positive assessments in two separate binary variables. It is
important to note that while these questions do not directly inquire about respondents' attitudes
toward the war itself, they serve as effective proxies for individuals’ perceptions related to the war.
Given the political environment in Russia, where open criticism or explicit discussions regarding
the war may pose personal risks, respondents might be reluctant to answer direct questions about
the war’s morality or legitimacy. Framing the questions around the perceived consequences on
economic growth and political stability provides a safer and more indirect way to gauge public
sentiment regarding the war’s broader implications.
Explanatory variables
We used the following demographic, socioeconomic, and ideological variables to test the
heterogeneity of perceptions of the impact of the war in Ukraine. Gender was recorded through
direct observation or respondent confirmation, coded as either man or woman. Age was captured
by asking respondents their exact age in years, with a range between 18 and 95, which we divided
into those aged 18-35, 36-55, and 56 and older. Marital status was classified into three categories:
(a) single (never married), (b) married, and (c) widowed, divorced, or separated. We accounted for
rural-urban settlement status and regional belonging of individuals in the following regions of
Russia: (a) Central (with Moscow and St. Petersburg included), (b) Far East, (c) North-West, (d)
Siberia, (e) South, (f) Ural, and (g) Volga.
Education levels were assessed by asking respondents about the highest degree they had
completed. The options ranged from (a) no formal education or degree, through various levels of
primary, secondary, and (b) post-secondary education, and (c) up to tertiary education, which
included bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degrees. Employment status consists of individuals who
(a) never worked, (b) not worked in the last year, (c) worked last year with no information on the
sector of employment, (d) worked in the public sector, (e) state-owned enterprises, (f) in the private
sector, and (g) who were self-employed. The variable on individuals’ material conditions was
derived from summing up answers (“yes, easily”=1 to “no”=3) on two questions asking individuals
if their households could afford each of the following (if they wanted to): “each year, a one-week
holiday out of home, including stay in second home, country house or at friends or relatives,”
“consumption of meat, chicken, fish or the vegetarian or vegan equivalent each second day.” To
capture individuals’ perceived socioeconomic status, the survey included a subjective
socioeconomic ladder, where respondents were asked to place their household on a 10-step ladder.
The lowest step represented the poorest 10% of people in the country, while the highest step
represented the richest 10%.
Respondents’ identity was captured with the responses “Russian” and “Soviet” on the
following question: “Which, if any, of the following do you identify as?”. Attitudes towards
democracy were operationalized by asking respondents to choose one of the three following
options: (a) “Democracy is preferable to any other form of political system,” (b) “For people like
me, it does not matter whether a government is democratic or authoritarian,” (c) “under some
circumstances, an authoritarian government may be preferable to a democratic one.” Trust in
institutions variables are operationalized by asking individuals to what extent did they trust (a) the
presidency and (b) armed forces with answer options of trust to distrust. For identifying the effect
of channels of news, we used answers “several times a week” or “daily” to create dummy variables
for the question asking individuals the following: "People use different sources to learn what is
going on in their country and the world. For each of the following sources, please indicate how
often you use it: (a) news broadcasts on radio and TV, and (b) social media. The descriptive
Statistical analyses
We first compare LITS IV participant countries by their respondents’ perceptions of war
consequences. For the statistical analyses, we dichotomize positive and negative assessments of
the war’s impact and fit binary regression models. More specifically, we use Linear Probability
Models (LPM) to investigate the predictors of positive and negative assessments regarding the
impact of the war in Ukraine on Russia's economic growth and political stability. The decision to
use LPMs is based on several methodological considerations, mainly the simplicity and
interpretability of the model when dealing with binary outcome variables. LPM is advantageous in
this context because it provides direct interpretability of the coefficients as marginal effects. The
coefficients in an LPM indicate the change in the probability of a positive or negative assessment
of the war’s impact for a one-unit change in a predictor variable. This allows for straightforward
interpretation, as opposed to the odds ratios generated by logistic models or the relative risk ratios
intuitive and harder to communicate, particularly to non-technical audiences.
Furthermore, while logistic regression or multinomial logistic models are common choices
for binary or categorical dependent variables, they present certain limitations in this research
context. Logistic models, while robust for estimating probabilities, provide non-linear results, and
interpreting odds ratios can often be challenging when comparing across models (Mood, 2010). In
contrast, LPM offers linear estimates of how each predictor influences the likelihood of a particular
outcome, which simplifies the understanding of how demographic, socioeconomic, and ideological
characteristics are linked to perceptions of the war's effects. In addition, LPM offers a
straightforward approach to estimating explained variance with an easily interpretable R-squared
statistic. This R-squared provides a measure of model fit, representing the proportion of variation
in the binary outcome explained by the predictors, which can be intuitively understood and
compared across models. Unlike non-linear binary models, such as logit or probit, which do not
naturally produce estimates of explained variance, LPM’s derived R-squared allows for more direct
comparisons, enabling clearer insights into the predictors’ explanatory power. The replication
package of the analyses is available through Open Science Framework (Authors, 2024).
Results
Concerns about the war across considered countries and Russia
impact of war in Ukraine on economic growth and political stability in respondents’ countries.
These descriptive results reveal significant variation across countries, likely reflecting regional
proximity to the war in Ukraine, historical ties with Russia, and domestic political environment. In
terms of economic growth, there is a clear trend across most countries where a large majority
anticipate negative consequences from the war. In countries such as Georgia and Moldova, along
with Bulgaria, more than four out of five respondents express concerns, possibly due to their
geopolitical vulnerability, unresolved territorial conflicts, and the ripple effects of sanctions on
Russia, a key trade partner. The geographic proximity to the conflict likely amplifies fears about
economic disruption, energy shortages, and refugee and migrant inflows, which could strain local
economies already dealing with post-pandemic recovery.
Similarly, respondents in Estonia and Slovakia demonstrate widespread pessimism
regarding economic prospects related to the war, further reflecting concerns about disruptions in
energy supply chains and trade, especially given their reliance on Russian energy. Respondents in
countries like Hungary and Lithuania also aligned with these concerns, reflecting how individuals
in the broader Europe perceived themselves as vulnerable to both immediate and long-term
economic disruptions. In contrast, Central Asian nations such as Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan
displayed more tempered concerns about economic impacts, with many respondents predicting
either no effect or even a positive outcome. These responses likely reflect the potential for these
nations to fill economic gaps created by Western sanctions on Russia, particularly in sectors like
energy, agriculture, and logistics. For instance, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan could benefit from
increased demand for non-Russian energy resources, as well as alternative trade routes being
developed to bypass Russia. Respondents in North African countries, including Algeria, also
exhibited more varied responses, possibly due to their economic insulation from the immediate
impacts of the war. As a major energy exporter, Algeria might benefit from rising energy prices due
to the disruption in Russian energy exports, which explains the relatively higher percentage of
respondents expecting a positive impact on their economy.
Regarding political stability, there is, again, significant divergence between countries, but the
general expectation is that the war would have destabilizing effects. Georgia and Moldova stand
out, with the highest proportion of respondents (more than four out of five) anticipating negative
impacts on political stability. These countries' geopolitical sensitivity, as former Soviet republics
with territorial disputes, likely contributes to their heightened concerns about spillover effects. The
war’s potential to incite domestic unrest or political crises due to external pressures is a prominent
worry, especially for nations balancing between Western alliances and historical ties with Russia.
In Central and Eastern Europe, countries like Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina reflect
individuals’ concerns about how the conflict might exacerbate internal divisions or reignite ethnic
tensions. Serbia’s traditional alignment with Russia, juxtaposed with its EU aspirations, may cause
political friction as the war continues, while Bosnia and Herzegovina, already facing political
fragmentation, could see further destabilization from the conflict’s regional consequences.
Respondents residing in Central Asian countries, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, show less
pronounced fears regarding political stability, likely due to their more centralized, authoritarian
political structures, which may mitigate the risks of immediate political instability. However, the
war’s broader geopolitical effects, including increased Russian influence and internal pressures on
these governments to align with or distance from Moscow, are still reflected in their levels of
concern. In North Africa, Algeria again shows relatively low concern for political instability, which
aligns with the country’s expectations of limited economic impact. As a distant observer of the
conflict, Algeria’s domestic political situation is less directly influenced by the war, and any
instability would likely be driven more by internal dynamics than by the war in Ukraine.
The data for Russia presents a paradox in how individuals perceive the impact of the
Ukraine war on both economic growth and political stability. Despite being at the center of the
conflict and facing substantial international sanctions, only 66% of Russian respondents anticipate
a negative effect on economic growth – significantly lower than in countries like Georgia and
Moldova. Moreover, 15% of Russians even predict a positive impact on their economy, a view that
is almost absent in countries that are not directly exposed to the conflict. On political stability, 59%
of Russians expect a negative impact, but a sizable 16% believe the war will have a positive effect
on political stability, reflecting an unexpected confidence in the country's internal resilience despite
the pressures of war and economic sanctions. This optimism is counterintuitive, considering
Russia’s direct involvement in the conflict, its economic isolation from the West, and the internal
political strain associated with managing a prolonged war. One might expect a higher level of
concern about economic downturns and political destabilization, as seen in many other countries
more distant from the war. Instead, the Russian public expresses more optimism as a sizable
proportion remains hopeful about the war’s potential benefits for the country – an outlook that
stands in contrast to the widespread pessimism found elsewhere. This divergence suggests that
public perception in Russia is shaped by unique factors, likely tied to internal political narratives,
government-controlled media, and social dynamics that dampen public expressions of concern.
Exploring attitudes toward the effect of war in Russia
ideological factors are associated with public perceptions in Russia regarding the war’s impact on
economic growth and political stability. After list-wise deletion of observations with missing
information, 858 individuals are available for our regression analyses. Gender, in particular, is one
of the most significant predictors of the outcome measures of our study, with women consistently
expressing more pessimistic views about the war's consequences than men. Women are 13% (p <
0.001) more likely than men to agree that the war will negatively affect Russia’s economic growth,
and they are 10% (p < 0.01) more likely to believe that the war will negatively impact political
stability. At the same time, women are 7% (p < 0.05) less likely to perceive the war as having a
positive effect on economic growth and political stability. These findings suggest that women are
more attuned to the potential socioeconomic risks of the conflict, possibly reflecting broader trends
where women, due to their roles in families and communities, are more sensitive to crises' long-
term impacts (Wolak, 2022).
Regional differences might also provide insights into how public opinion varies across
Russia. Respondents from the Ural region are 12% (p < 0.05) more likely to agree that the war will
positively affect political stability. This suggests that individuals in this region, which is located far
from the conflict zone and has strong economic ties to state-controlled industries, may perceive the
war as a stabilizing force that could benefit the country’s political landscape. Similarly, respondents
from the Volga region are 9% and 12% more likely to expect positive effects on economic growth
and political stability, respectively (p < 0.05). The varying economic and historical ties may explain
the differences these regions have to the central government, as well as the influence of state
propaganda that draws on historical narratives, such as the memory of World War II in Volgograd
(formerly Stalingrad), to justify the ongoing war. Individuals residing in regions more closely tied
to the war effort, either through economic dependencies on state-led industries or through proximity
to military infrastructure, are more likely to view the war in a positive light compared to regions
that are more economically isolated or politically distanced from the central government.
Education emerges as a significant factor that is associated with perceptions of the war.
Those with a university education are 11% more likely to agree that the war will negatively affect
economic growth (p < 0.01) and 13% more likely to expect negative outcomes for political stability
(p < 0.05). This indicates that higher education equips individuals with the critical thinking skills
necessary to evaluate the broader risks associated with the conflict, likely due to their access to a
more comprehensive range of information sources, including independent media and public
discourse. The lack of a significant relationship between higher education and positive perceptions
of the war’s outcomes underscores the role of education in fostering critical perspectives,
particularly in authoritarian regimes where state narratives dominate public discourse.
Ideological factors, particularly trust in institutions, play a significant role in shaping both
optimistic and pessimistic views about the war. Trust in the president remains a key predictor of
how individuals assess the war’s impact. Respondents who express trust in President Putin are 10%
less likely to agree with negative assessments of the war’s impact on economic growth (p < 0.05)
and 17% less likely to expect negative effects on political stability (p < 0.001). Furthermore, those
who trust the president are 9% and 10% more likely to agree that the war will positively affect
economic growth and political stability (p < 0.05). This finding underscores the powerful role of
political loyalty in shaping public opinion, particularly in a highly controlled media environment
like Russia’s, where state narratives are reinforced through political leadership. In contrast, distrust
in the military is associated with a 17% lower likelihood of agreeing that the war will negatively
affect political stability (p < 0.05), suggesting that optimism toward military leadership contributes
to less critical views of the war’s overall impact on the country’s economic and political prospects.
Media consumption also has significant links with war-related perceptions. Regular news
consumption, whether state-controlled or independent TV or radio, increases the likelihood of
agreeing with negative assessments of the war’s impact on political stability, though the effect size
is modest. This suggests that frequent exposure to media heightens awareness of the war’s potential
consequences, contributing to a more nuanced view of the conflict. Social media consumption is
similarly associated with more critical assessments of the war’s impact, particularly regarding
negative perceptions of political stability. Although the effects are small, they highlight the role of
alternative information sources in fostering skepticism toward state narratives and shaping public
opinion in a more critical direction.
Profiles of individuals with positive and negative perceptions
negative effects of the war in Ukraine on economic growth, political stability, and simultaneously
on economic growth and political stability. We use five characteristics identified as important for
perceptions of war consequences to derive a profile that is optimistic about the impact of war –
low-educated men, living in Volga region, trusting the president, and not getting news often from
social media, and compare it with a pessimistic profile – highly educated women living in
the Central region of Russia, distrusting the president, and getting news often from social media.
This contrast makes clear the extent of differences between various types of individuals in Russia
regarding the impact of the war on the country.
For the positive economic growth consequences of the war in Ukraine, perceptions diverge sharply
between the war optimists, with 0.29 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.38) probability, and
war pessimists, with almost no chance of them expecting positive economic outcomes (0.00,
95%CI, -0.06-0.07). Conversely, perceptions of negative impacts on economic growth are
significantly higher for highly educated women from Central Russia who distrust the president and
get news from social media, with a probability of 0.95 (95%CI, 0.86-1.04), compared to 54
percentage points lower outcome probability among war optimists (0.41, 95%CI, 0.31-0.52).
Perceptions of political stability also reveal significant gaps driven by the specific combination of
gender, education, region, trust, and news consumption patterns. War optimists have a predicted
outcome probability of 0.37 (95%CI, 0.28-0.46). Conversely, it is unlikely to find anyone among
war pessimists to share a similar perception of war’s positive effect on political stability (0.01,
95%CI -0.06-0.08). On the negative side, the probability that low-educated men from the Volga
region who trust the president and do not usually get news from social media foresee a negative
impact is 0.35 (95%CI 0.25.0.46), while for war pessimist predictive outcome is 0.84 (95%CI 0.74-
0.94). The results are comparable when the outcome measures simultaneously include a positive or
negative assessment of the impact of war on economic growth and political stability, with up to 37
percentage points difference between war optimists and pessimists in Russia.
Comparing explained variance in LPM across countries
how well the selected variables explain the variance in individuals' assessments of the war in
Ukraine’s impact on economic growth and political stability. We ranked countries by the explained
variance of negative consequences of the war. Three important observations can be made. First, the
R-squared values reveal considerable variation across countries, with some showing much higher
levels of explained variance than others. This suggests that unique country characteristics are
important in explaining their populations’ attitudes toward the consequences of the war. Second, in
most countries, apart from Moldova, Romania, the West Bank and Gaza, Serbia, models explain a
higher share of variation in the negative effect of war than the positive effect of war. This suggests
that the employed variables perform better in explaining the negative perceptions, while other
characteristics not accounted for in the models matter more for the positive perceptions of the war
consequences. We can also infer that the war's negative consequences are more easily understood
and uniformly viewed by individuals in considered countries, while positive assessments remain
more diverse and less tied to the considered individual characteristics.
Third, in Russia, the model explains a relatively higher proportion of the variation in negative
assessments, with an estimated R-squared of 13%. This suggests that the variables considered, such
as gender, education, regional differences, trust in institutions, and media consumption, provide a
relatively high fit for explaining the negative perceptions of the war's effects in this country. The
strongest contributing factor is trust in the armed forces, which accounts for around 5% of
the explained variance. By the explained variance of positive assessment of the war, Russia ranks
somewhere in the middle of the considered countries. It is a possibility that a positive assessment
of the war’s consequences is more affected by state-controlled media and government propaganda,
and this effect is universal, not related to the individuals’ characteristics. Lithuania has the highest
R-squared values, 11% for positive assessments and 31% for negative ones. This indicates a much
more predictable public opinion in Lithuania, along with the individual-level characteristics
included in the regression model. Lithuania’s proximity to Russia, its historical experiences with
Soviet influence, and its geopolitical concerns may contribute to the observed results, as the
considered factors likely weigh heavily on public opinion. Using nested regression, we have
identified that attitudes toward democracy vs. authoritarianism are the strongest contributors to
the R-squired of the negative consequences of the war for this county, explaining around 8% of
the variance.
Discussion
This paper examined public perceptions of the Ukraine war's impact, particularly how Russian
attitudes toward the conflict's economic and political consequences diverge significantly from those
in other countries. The research question at the core of this study aimed to understand why, despite
facing severe economic repercussions, sanctions, and rising geopolitical pressures, a substantial
portion of the Russian population remains optimistic about the war’s outcomes. Theoretically, the
study is grounded in insights from political sociology and media theory, specifically focusing on
how public opinion is shaped in authoritarian regimes. The Spiral of Silence and collective action
constrains’ theoretical perspectives imply that the Russian government’s ability to manipulate and
control information has enabled it to maintain public support for the war. By promoting
nationalistic messaging and presenting dissent as unpatriotic, the state has crafted a resilient, largely
positive narrative around the war, fostering a perception among Russian citizens that the war is a
necessary defense against Western encroachment. This unique sociopolitical environment likely
explains why, even amidst economic hardship, a paradoxical optimism about the war persists
among many Russians.
Methodologically, the study employed a cross-national, comparative design using data from
the fourth wave of the LITS. This large-scale survey encompasses responses from Russia and 36
other countries, providing a broad comparative framework for analyzing perceptions of the war’s
impact. The findings reveal substantial variation in perceptions of the war’s impact across the
surveyed countries, with Russia standing out for its relatively optimistic perspective, particularly
regarding its economic resilience. While respondents in many neighboring countries express deep-
seated fears about economic disruption and political instability stemming from the war, a notable
portion of Russians anticipate positive outcomes, especially concerning the economy. In the
comparative analysis, countries geographically closer to the conflict, like Georgia and Moldova,
display high levels of concern about the war’s repercussions on political stability and economic
growth. In Russia, however, this sense of threat is less prevalent, and optimism is closely tied to
factors such as trust in the president and the military. Respondents who place high trust in these
institutions are far more likely to express confidence in the war’s potential benefits, underscoring
the role of political loyalty in shaping public opinion within authoritarian contexts. Meanwhile,
demographic factors like gender and education also play a role in shaping attitudes within Russia:
women and highly educated individuals are more inclined toward pessimistic assessments,
potentially reflecting a greater sensitivity to the war’s socioeconomic toll or access to more diverse
information sources. This pattern suggests that higher education may encourage critical thinking
and access to a broader range of information, fostering resistance to state propaganda and
contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the war’s challenges.
Regional differences within Russia further highlight how local economic dependencies and
historical context shape public opinion. Respondents from regions with strong economic ties to the
state or military-industrial sectors, such as the Volga and Ural regions, are more likely to express
positive views on the war’s impact. This trend likely reflects the influence of state-led narratives
that portray the war as a stabilizing force or a driver of economic growth. In contrast, individuals
from major cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg, who are more exposed to alternative media and
the direct economic effects of sanctions, show higher concern regarding the war’s long-term
consequences.
We assumed that regular exposure to state-controlled media reinforces the state’s narrative,
fostering a more favorable outlook on the war’s effects. Conversely, individuals who frequently
access independent or social media sources are more likely to view the war critically, particularly
regarding its impact on political stability. We found some evidence that more frequent consumption
of the news, regardless of its source, was linked to a more negative assessment of the war’s impact
on political stability. Nonetheless, it is likely that the Russian government’s control over traditional
media outlets has enabled it to present a unifying, supportive narrative, portraying the war as a
necessary stand against Western aggression. For those who rely primarily on state media, this
narrative might foster a sense of resilience and optimism despite the tangible economic hardships
resulting from the war and international sanctions. However, social media’s influence, though
limited by governmental restrictions, provides a channel for alternative perspectives, contributing
to a more critical view among its users.
Despite the described insights, the study has limitations that warrant caution in interpreting
the results. One limitation arises from the reliance on cross-sectional data, which captures
perceptions at a single point in time and does not account for shifts in attitudes that may occur as
the conflict progresses or as economic conditions change. Longitudinal data would provide a more
nuanced understanding of how perceptions evolve in response to changing circumstances, such as
fluctuations in the economic impact of sanctions or shifts in the war's intensity. For instance, in the
second half of 2024, military activities spread within Russian territory in the region of Kursk, which
would likely affect individuals' perceptions about the implications of war (Oxford Analytica, 2024).
Additionally, the survey does not explicitly inquire about perceptions of the war itself, focusing
instead on its economic and political consequences. This indirect approach may lead to response
biases, as individuals may interpret the questions differently based on their political stance or
personal experiences. The sensitive political environment in Russia also poses challenges;
respondents may self-censor or provide socially desirable responses, particularly when asked about
political stability, to avoid potential repercussions. Finally, certain individual-level factors, such as
exposure to economic hardships or personal experiences with the war's effects, are complex to
measure and may not be adequately captured in the employed variables.
Conclusion
This study contributes to emerging scholarship on how state narratives, political loyalty, and media
control define public perceptions in Russia during the invasion of Ukraine. While facing high
economic and social costs, Russian respondents demonstrate a paradoxical optimism, suggesting
that government influence over information and public narratives has played a role in shaping a
largely supportive public opinion. This study advances understanding of public opinion in
authoritarian contexts, illustrating how tightly controlled information environments can foster
positive assessments of conflict even when the material consequences are negative. Future research
could address the limitations of the study by utilizing longitudinal data to track shifts in public
perception and exploring additional factors, such as economic resilience and changing geopolitical
dynamics, that may influence attitudes over time. This would deepen our understanding of how
public opinion adapts in response to long-term conflicts and restrictive information environments,
particularly in authoritarian regimes where state control over media remains a potent tool for
shaping public sentiment.
