Abstract: Motor impairments, such as unusual posture, are a critical aspect of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that
affects individuals of all ages and influences how the disorder manifests. This review examines the prevalence and
consequences of motor impairments in ASD, exploring their relationship with key characteristics, potential
neurobiological factors, and implications for intervention and future research. By reviewing recent studies, literature
reviews, and theoretical perspectives, this review reveals the complex interplay between motor abilities, sensory
processing, social cognition, and overall development in individuals with ASD. The findings show that motor
impairments are not just co-occurring features but are integral to the condition, affecting the severity of social
communication difficulties, restricted and repetitive behaviors, and adaptive functioning. This review highlights the
need for a shift in ASD research and intervention, moving away from isolated approaches and embracing a more
comprehensive perspective that considers the significant impact of motor impairments on individuals with ASD.

1. Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects social communication, behavior, and
sensory processing from an early age [1, 2]. It is characterized by persistent difficulties in social interaction, restricted
interests, and unusual sensory reactions. The disorder's lifelong nature is rooted in its neurobiological basis [3-7]. The
diverse range of abilities and challenges within the ASD population highlights the need for personalized understanding
and support [8]. Approximately 1% of the global population has ASD, with higher rates in high-income countries, which
raises questions about the impact of awareness and diagnostic practices on these rates [1]. Individuals with ASD often
have co-occurring psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
and mood disorders. These conditions worsen their well-being and require comprehensive, integrated care [9]. The
connection between ASD and other conditions highlights the complex interaction of genetic, environmental, and
neurobiological factors that shape the experiences of individuals with ASD [10-13]. Recent research emphasizes the
significance of motor impairments and atypical postural control in individuals with ASD, beyond the traditional
diagnostic criteria of social communication and repetitive behaviors [14-17]. These motor challenges have a profound
impact on development, coordination, and overall quality of life. For instance, difficulties with motor planning and
NAAR, July 2024 Volume 7, Issue 7, 97-108 98 of 108
coordination can limit the acquisition of new skills, such as writing or participating in sports, which in turn affect social
interaction and learning opportunities [3, 18, 19]. A comprehensive understanding of ASD requires a holistic approach
that considers not only the core social and behavioral characteristics but also the significant role of motor impairments
in shaping individual experiences. This literature review provides a comprehensive examination of motor impairments
in ASD, with a focus on atypical postural control. By synthesizing current research, this review aims to clarify the
connections between motor abilities, sensory processing, social cognition, and overall development in individuals with
ASD across the lifespan. The review will explore the prevalence and nature of motor deficits in ASD, their relationship
to core ASD symptoms, and their impact on daily activities and quality of life. It will also investigate the neurobiological
basis of these impairments, including cerebellar structure and function, and evaluate current intervention strategies.
This review aims to highlight the fundamental role of motor challenges in ASD manifestation and advocate for a shift
in ASD research and intervention. Ultimately, it seeks to inform future research directions, clinical practice, and the
development of more effective, personalized interventions that address both motor and core ASD challenges in an
integrated manner.
2. Motor Impairments in Autism Spectrum Disorder
2.1 Overview of motor deficits in ASD
Motor impairments are a common and persistent problem for individuals with ASD, extending beyond the social and
communication difficulties that define the condition [20]. These deficits affect both fine motor skills, such as precise
hand movements for writing, and gross motor skills, which involve coordination and balance during activities like
sports or walking [21, 22]. Posture control challenges, observed in unusual walking patterns and balance difficulties,
highlight the sensory and motor difficulties associated with ASD [23, 24]. Notably, these motor impairments often
emerge early in childhood, potentially even before social and communication difficulties. This underscores the
importance of early screening and intervention [23]. As these motor challenges persist throughout life, they can
significantly impact an individual's ability to interact with their environment, learn new skills, and fully participate in
social and academic activities [25, 26].
2.2 Relationship between motor skills and autism severity
Research indicates a strong link between motor skills and the severity of ASD, suggesting that motor impairments are
integral to the condition rather than just a coincidence [20]. Studies have found significant correlations between deficits
in gross motor skills (e.g., coordination and balance) and fine motor skills (e.g., precise hand movements) and the
severity of ASD's core symptoms, including social communication and repetitive behavior impairments [27, 28].
Notably, early motor skills development may even predict later challenges with ASD symptoms, as delays in these skills
may indicate greater difficulties in childhood [29]. This potential for motor skills to predict or influence ASD severity
underscores the importance of early, comprehensive motor assessments, which should be integrated into diagnostic
and intervention approaches [30]. Addressing these motor challenges may be crucial to unlocking the full potential of
individuals with ASD across various developmental areas.
2.3 Association of motor impairments with social deficits
The link between motor impairments and social deficits in ASD is a crucial area of research, with implications for
understanding and treating the condition. Studies consistently show that children with ASD often have motor
impairments, affecting both fine motor skills (e.g., hand movements) and gross motor skills (e.g., balance and
coordination) [31, 32, 21]. They may also struggle with more complex abilities, such as praxis (planning and executing
movements) and interpersonal synchrony (coordinating movements with others). These motor deficits are not simply
a coincidence, but are connected to social communication difficulties. Research has found that weaker motor skills are
correlated with greater social deficits [21]. The underlying neurobiological basis of this association is becoming clearer,
with evidence suggesting disrupted functional connectivity between brain regions critical for visual-motor integration
and social cognition, such as the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala [33, 34]. Furthermore, research has identified
NAAR, July 2024 Volume 7, Issue 7, 97-108 99 of 108
unique deficits in embodied simulation in ASD, which involves integrating visual input with motor output [35]. These
deficits may contribute to difficulties in imitation and acquiring social skills. These findings emphasize the importance
of considering motor impairments not only as a common co-occurring feature of ASD but also as a potential core aspect
of the disorder that influences the development and presentation of social deficits. Therefore, ASD treatment
approaches should include comprehensive motor assessments and targeted interventions that address both motor and
social domains [36, 37].
2.4 Impact of sensorimotor problems on daily living activities
Individuals with ASD face significant sensorimotor challenges that impact daily activities and essential functional skills
for independence and quality of life. These challenges lead to difficulties with fine and gross motor skills, postural
control, and manual dexterity, affecting tasks like dressing, eating, and toileting [38, 39]. The underlying neurological
basis for these difficulties involves altered cortical-striatal processes and reduced functional connectivity in the
sensorimotor network, resulting in deficits in motor planning and execution [40, 26]. Notably, individuals with ASD
exhibit larger postural sway and increased attention demands during motor tasks, suggesting that even simple activities
require greater cognitive resources [41]. These sensorimotor challenges persist from childhood to adulthood, with
evidence of impaired motor skills and atypical functional connectivity in middle-aged adults with ASD [26]. The
widespread nature of these issues underscores the need for targeted interventions that address sensorimotor deficits
throughout life, potentially improving overall functioning and reducing ASD symptom severity [42, 40]. Individuals
with ASD face significant sensorimotor challenges that impact essential daily activities and skills necessary for
independence and quality of life, such as dressing, eating, and toileting [38, 39]. These difficulties arise from altered
cortical-striatal processes and reduced functional connectivity in the sensorimotor network, leading to deficits in motor
planning and execution [40, 26]. Individuals with ASD exhibit larger postural sway and increased cognitive demands
during motor tasks, indicating that even simple activities require more cognitive resources [41]. These challenges persist
from childhood to adulthood, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to improve overall functioning and
reduce ASD symptom severity [42, 40].
3. Postural Control in Autism Spectrum Disorder
3.1 Understanding postural control issues in individuals with ASD
Postural control issues in individuals with ASD involve complex sensorimotor deficits that affect balance and stability.
A key challenge is the impaired integration of multiple sensory inputs, particularly in visual and somatosensory
processing [43, 44]. This leads to increased postural sway and reduced complexity in side-to-side movements. Moreover,
individuals with ASD require more cognitive resources for tasks involving postural control, even simple balance
activities [41]. Notably, social stimuli also impact postural control, with increased sway during tasks involving faces
compared to objects, especially in individuals with more severe ASD [45]. These postural control issues persist from
early development through adulthood, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions throughout life [46, 47].
Furthermore, the specific patterns of postural sway observed in ASD, such as greater sway area and deficits in side-to-
side control, not only distinguish it from other neurodevelopmental disorders but also have potential as sensitive
diagnostic markers [48, 49].
3.2 Link between postural control and motor skills
The connection between postural control and motor skills is complex and can be seen at different stages of development
and in various neurological conditions, especially in ASD. Studies show that sensorimotor processing and multisensory
integration are essential for maintaining postural stability, which is the basis for developing fundamental motor skills
[47, 50]. People with ASD often have increased postural sway and struggle with processing sensory information, leading
to difficulties with both fine and gross motor control [51, 52]. These postural control deficits affect not only basic balance
and locomotor skills but also have broader impacts on more complex motor behaviors and overall functional
development [53]. Notably, there is a two-way relationship between postural stability and motor skill proficiency,
NAAR, July 2024 Volume 7, Issue 7, 97-108 100 of 108
where improvements in one area can enhance performance in the other. This interconnectedness highlights the
importance of targeting both postural control and motor skills in assessment and intervention strategies, particularly
for individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders [54, 55].
3.3 Mediating effects of sequential memory on self-care performance
The connection between sequential memory and self-care performance in individuals with ASD is influenced by various
factors, including visual-motor integration, cognitive processes, and functional outcomes. Research by Lin et al. [56]
shows that sequential memory plays a key role in linking visual-motor integration to self-care performance in young
children with ASD, highlighting its significance in daily functioning. These findings align with broader research on
memory processes in ASD, which suggests difficulties in short-term memory and episodic long-term memory,
particularly in the visual domain [57]. Executive functioning also affects the relationship between sequential memory
and self-care performance. A study by Landsiedel and Williams [58] found that executive set-shifting and inhibitory
control abilities significantly impact prospective memory in adults with ASD. Furthermore, selective attention in context
memory [59] and the subject-performed task effect in working memory [60] suggest that multiple cognitive factors
contribute to memory performance in individuals with ASD, potentially affecting their self-care abilities. These insights
stress the importance of tailored interventions that target both visual-motor integration and sequential memory to
improve self-care outcomes in individuals with ASD.
4. Interventions and Management Strategies
4.1 Role of exercise in improving health outcomes in individuals with ASD
Exercise offers benefits beyond physical fitness, showing promise as a therapeutic tool for improving health outcomes
in individuals with ASD [61]. Customized exercise interventions, such as aerobic exercise and game-based programs,
have been found to significantly improve cognitive function, including attention and memory. Additionally, these
interventions have been shown to reduce stereotyped motor behaviors commonly seen in individuals with ASD [62,
63]. Moreover, exercise has been shown to have a positive impact on social skills and behavioral challenges, potentially
promoting greater social interaction while reducing emotional reactivity and sleep disturbances [64]. The benefits of
exercise may be attributed to its ability to reduce neuroinflammation, enhance brain plasticity, and release mood-
boosting endorphins [65, 66]. Given this growing body of evidence, it is clear that exercise should be a crucial component
of comprehensive treatment strategies for individuals with ASD. This involves incorporating structured exercise
interventions as well as increasing physical activity in daily routines.
4.2 Evaluation of motor interventions on gross motor skills development
The effectiveness of motor interventions on gross motor skill development in individuals with ASD is evaluated using
a comprehensive approach that includes standardized assessments, functional measures, and task-specific observations
[67, 68]. Standardized tools, such as the TGMD-2 and BOT-2, provide objective measures of improvements in
locomotion, object control, balance, and coordination. These tools accurately measure the impact of interventions on
core gross motor abilities [69, 70]. In addition to standardized assessments, evaluating functional performance, such as
self-care skills and daily activities, provides valuable insights into the real-world implications of improved motor skills
[71]. Task-specific games or activities incorporated into the evaluation process further enhance understanding of how
interventions influence movement accuracy, form, and the child's ability to perform specific motor tasks with reduced
prompting [68]. This multi-dimensional evaluation approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the
effectiveness of motor interventions in promoting meaningful improvements in gross motor development and
functional outcomes for individuals with ASD.
4.3 Effects of a motor activity program on social skills in students with ASD
Emerging evidence suggests that motor activity programs, typically focused on improving motor skills, can have a
significant positive impact on social skills in students with ASD [72]. These programs provide valuable opportunities
for students with ASD to engage in social interaction within a structured and supportive environment. They include
NAAR, July 2024 Volume 7, Issue 7, 97-108 101 of 108
activities ranging from inclusive physical education to structured interventions that incorporate social games [73].
Participating in physical activities, such as team-based games or cooperative tasks, naturally promotes communication,
collaboration, and social cognition development [72]. Additionally, these programs may improve motor abilities, such
as coordination and balance, allowing for greater participation in group activities and reducing social anxiety, which
further enhances social engagement [74]. The positive impact of motor activity programs on social skills in ASD may be
linked to multiple underlying mechanisms. These programs provide a structured setting where students can practice
social skills in a safe and supportive environment, learning and applying social rules, interpreting social cues, and
engaging in reciprocal communication [73]. Exercise also improves physical fitness and releases mood-boosting
endorphins, which can increase social confidence and reduce anxiety, leading to better social interactions [61]. Research
suggests that the program's design, including the involvement of typically developing peers and social games,
significantly affects the benefits to social skills for students with ASD [72, 75]. A thoughtful and individualized approach
to program design is therefore crucial to maximize the positive impact on social skills development.
5. Neurobiological Basis of Motor Impairments
5.1 Cerebellar structure and function in ASD
Research increasingly suggests that the cerebellum, a brain structure typically linked to motor control, plays a
significant role in the neurobiology of ASD. Alterations in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis may affect motor
coordination, balance, and even social-emotional processing [76, 77]. Functional neuroimaging reveals abnormal
activity and connectivity patterns within cerebrocerebellar circuits, indicating disruptions in communication between
the cerebellum and other brain regions involved in motor planning, language processing, and social cognition [78, 79].
These findings, supported by cellular and molecular studies, imply that cerebellar dysfunction may contribute to the
diverse symptoms observed in ASD. Besides its role in motor control, the cerebellum is involved in adaptive prediction,
a cognitive function that enables us to anticipate and respond flexibly to changing environmental demands [80].
Individuals with ASD often struggle with adaptive prediction, which may contribute to social anxiety, sensory
sensitivities, and insistence on sameness [80]. The atypical structure and function of the cerebellum in ASD, particularly
in regions like the right Crus I/II, involved in higher-order cognitive functions, could disrupt these predictive processes
[81, 79]. This new understanding of the cerebellum's role in ASD provides insights into the disorder's complex
neurobiology and paves the way for developing targeted interventions, such as cerebellar neuromodulation, to address
specific challenges associated with ASD [82].
5.2 Prospective motor control strategies in ASD
Individuals with ASD often struggle with prospective motor control, which involves anticipating and planning
movements in advance. This difficulty can significantly impact their motor skills and overall development [83]. Unlike
typically developing individuals, who use predictions to guide movement through feedforward control, individuals
with ASD tend to rely on reactive control, adjusting their actions based on sensory feedback after a movement has
started [83]. This atypical motor control strategy can lead to delayed motor development, difficulty acquiring new motor
skills, and unusual movement patterns, commonly observed in individuals with ASD [84, 85]. Addressing these
challenges requires a comprehensive approach that considers both motor learning strategies and effective motor
interventions. Research suggests that individuals with ASD may benefit more from visual instructions, such as
demonstrations or picture cues, when learning new motor skills, rather than verbal instructions [84]. This highlights the
importance of tailored teaching approaches. Motor interventions that incorporate engaging activities, such as games,
sports, and dance, can promote the development of prospective control strategies by encouraging anticipation and
planning [86]. Early intervention is crucial, as addressing motor delays and prospective control challenges in early
childhood offers the greatest potential for improvement [67]. By enhancing prospective motor control, interventions can
improve motor skills and contribute to broader benefits in social communication, adaptive behavior, and overall quality
of life for individuals with ASD.

5.3 Relationship between motor skills level and autism severity
Motor impairments in individuals with ASD are not a coincidental feature, but rather closely tied to the overall severity
of the condition [20]. Research consistently shows that motor skills and autistic symptomatology are negatively
correlated. Individuals with more pronounced motor difficulties, including both gross and fine motor skills, tend to
face greater challenges with core ASD symptoms, such as social communication impairments, restricted repetitive
behaviors, and limitations in adaptive functioning [87, 88]. This association is not only evident in diagnosed individuals
but also in younger siblings of children with ASD, who often exhibit early motor delays that may indicate later
challenges with ASD-related features [89]. Several potential explanations exist for this complex relationship. Studies
suggest that damaging de novo mutations, especially those disrupting gene function, are associated with more severe
motor impairments in individuals with ASD [90]. This highlights the role of genetic factors in influencing both motor
abilities and ASD severity. The interconnected nature of brain development may also lead to shared neurobiological
foundations for motor and social-communicative challenges. This explains why individuals with more pronounced
motor impairments often experience greater difficulties with core ASD symptoms [30]. This growing understanding
underscores the importance of early and comprehensive motor skill assessments in ASD. These assessments enable the
development of tailored interventions that address both motor challenges and core ASD symptoms, maximizing
developmental potential.
6. Future Directions and Implications
Despite growing recognition of motor impairments as a significant aspect of ASD, substantial challenges and gaps
remain in current research. A major limitation is the tendency to treat motor deficits as a homogeneous category,
overlooking the wide spectrum of specific difficulties experienced by individuals with ASD [20]. This lack of specificity
hinders the development of targeted interventions and limits our understanding of how individual differences in motor
skills relate to other ASD challenges. Furthermore, although some studies suggest that early motor delays may predict
later ASD severity [29], reliable and clinically useful screening tools for early identification are lacking [30]. This
highlights the need for longitudinal research to establish clearer developmental trajectories of motor skills in ASD and
inform timely interventions. A complex area requiring further investigation is the interconnected nature of motor and
social impairments in ASD. Research consistently shows a high prevalence of both impairments [21], but the underlying
neurobiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Further research should prioritize understanding the interplay
between brain regions and networks involved in motor control and social cognition, which may reveal shared neural
substrates or developmental pathways [33, 34]. This understanding is crucial for developing holistic interventions that
effectively address both motor and social challenges. Research gaps exist in understanding the complexities of postural
control in ASD. Atypical sensory processing, particularly in the visual and somatosensory domains, contributes to
postural instability [43, 44]. However, further research is needed to understand how these sensory differences interact
with other factors, such as attentional demands and social stimuli, to influence balance control [41, 45]. Moreover, while
distinct postural sway patterns in ASD show promise as potential diagnostic markers [48, 49], their reliability and
validity require further investigation before they can be confidently integrated into clinical practice. Bridging the gap
between research and clinical practice remains a significant challenge. It is crucial to translate findings into easily
implementable, individualized interventions tailored to each individual's specific motor needs with ASD [30]. This
requires developing targeted interventions and robust evaluation methods that go beyond standardized assessments
to include ecologically valid measures of functional performance and real-world activity participation [67, 68, 71]. By
addressing these research gaps and promoting collaboration among researchers, clinicians, and families, we can pave
the way for more effective interventions and significantly enhance the lives of individuals with ASD.
7. Conclusion
This review highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing motor impairments as integral aspects of ASD.
Motor difficulties, although often overshadowed by social communication and behavioral challenges, are prevalent and
NAAR, July 2024 Volume 7, Issue 7, 97-108 103 of 108
persistent, affecting individuals throughout their lives. Key findings reveal a complex relationship between motor
abilities and ASD presentation. Deficits in fine and gross motor skills, sensory processing, and motor planning
significantly impact an individual's ability to engage with their environment, acquire new skills, and fully participate
in social and academic life. Addressing motor challenges goes beyond improving physical coordination. Research
shows a strong link between motor skills and the severity of core ASD symptoms. Individuals with more pronounced
motor impairments often experience greater difficulties with social communication, exhibit more repetitive behaviors,
and face greater adaptive functioning limitations. This interconnectedness highlights the need for a paradigm shift in
ASD research and intervention, adopting a holistic perspective that considers the interplay of motor abilities, sensory
processing, social cognition, and overall development. Research should prioritize understanding the complex
neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor impairments in ASD. This includes exploring atypical sensory
integration, investigating disrupted neural connectivity patterns, and deepening our understanding of cerebellar
dysfunction in relation to motor control and social-cognitive processes. It is also crucial to develop sensitive and specific
screening tools for early detection of motor impairments during development. Moreover, personalized interventions
must be carefully designed and evaluated to cater to each individual's unique needs. By prioritizing these areas of
inquiry and promoting collaboration among researchers, clinicians, and families, we can enhance our understanding of
motor impairments in ASD. This will enable us to develop more effective interventions, empowering individuals with
ASD to live more independently, self-determined, and fulfilling lives.
