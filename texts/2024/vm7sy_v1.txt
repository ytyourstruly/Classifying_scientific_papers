Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted people globally both collectively – i.e., through waves of
illness, government restrictions, and economic downturns – and individually, – i.e., individual
health, COVID-related behaviors, and financial struggles. Individuals’ subjective attitudes are
critical for mitigating the impact of large crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and are shaped by
both collective and individual experiences. Developing an understanding of how attitudes are
shaped by collective and individual experiences is a crucial next step, however, real-world data
are lacking. Using within-participant longitudinal data from the COVID-Dynamic project
(assessing socioemotional and behavioral change from April 2020 – July 2021 in >1,000 U.S.
residents) we characterized the contributions of collective and individual COVID experiences to
subjective COVID-19-related attitudes (i.e., health concerns, norm agreement, attitudes toward
restrictions). After demonstrating the validity and reliability of our COVID attitude measures, we
show that while individual experiences (behavioral restrictions and financial hardship) and
demographic factors (political identity, age, and sex) strongly predicted subjective COVID-related
attitudes, collective experiences had minimal impact. These findings emphasize the
predominance of individual hardship and personal identity over collective experiences in shaping
attitudes and highlight the need for future research and evaluation of crisis interventions that
prioritize addressing personal-level impacts.
Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic was a collective stressor of global proportions unparalleled in
1 2
modern history (3 million estimated Covid-19 deaths globally , 3.4% decrease in global GDP ,
massive job losses particularly among youth and women , severe negative impacts on mental
health ). While there were many shared experiences across this period (e.g., illness, loss, social
isolation), the impacts of the pandemic objectively diverged across different communities and
individuals. For example, infection and mortality rates were higher in New York than many other
places during the first wave of COVID-19 infections in the US; Black and Latino communities
6–9
suffered worse health outcomes compared to White communities ; Republicans contracted
COVID-19 at higher rates than Democrats ; and rural areas had higher hospitalization rates than
urban areas . Moreover, there is abundant evidence that individuals’ subjective attitudes towards
12,13
the impacts of the pandemic varied both across demographic categories (e.g., age, gender ,
14 13,15 16,17
political leanings , psychological factors ) and over time .
Extensive psychosocial research has demonstrated that shared experiences, including
community-wide memories and trauma—which society endured during the COVID-19
18–20
pandemic—profoundly influence human attitudes and behavior . It is also well-established
21–23
that one’s idiosyncratic history of adversities , along with social identity and group affiliations
24,25
, play a crucial role in shaping individual perspectives. However, it is often challenging to
distinguish the independent contributions of personal and collective adversity to attitudes and
behavior, as they frequently intertwine, making isolated evaluation complex.
Here, we leveraged a unique dataset to explore how collective and individual experiences
intersect to influence attitudes and behavior in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In April
2020, we launched a large-scale (1,000+ US residents), longitudinal (17 waves, until June, 2021)
study with the goal of characterizing the psychological, social, and emotional impacts of the
specific to the pandemic from three domains: assessments of participants’ self-reported attitudes
towards the pandemic (developed in-house); self-reported personal pandemic experiences and
behaviors (i.e., COVID-19 health impact on participants’ social network, restriction of personal
behaviors, personal economic experiences); and lastly, national, and US-state- and county-level
objective metrics of local community pandemic impacts (i.e., case rates, restrictions,
unemployment rates; collected from external sources). By collecting data during a period of
widespread societal impact and considerable variation in individual experiences, we had the rare
opportunity to simultaneously examine the effects of these two dimensions. This comprehensive
the nuanced ways in which different groups and individuals have navigated these tumultuous
times. In doing so, we aim to contribute to a more detailed understanding of how collective and
personal experiences influence individual attitudes and behaviors.
The goals of the current study were 1) establish the validity and reliability of our
comprehensive set of in-house measures designed to capture personal pandemic-related
attitudes, including health concerns, norm agreement, and restriction importance. 2) Demonstrate
the utility of these attitude measures through a detailed summary of participants’ self-reported
personal pandemic experiences, alongside a set of participant-linked community-level indices of
pandemic impacts derived from publicly available data. Specifically, we present an analysis of the
temporal dynamics of these measures—personal attitudes, personal experiences and behaviors,
and local community-level impacts—highlighting their variability between participants and
communities (i.e., within each wave of data collection) and over time within participants and
communities (i.e., across waves). Finally, 3) leverage these unique datasets to elucidate how
participants’ demographic identity, personal experiences, and collective community impacts
influence our validated measures of their pandemic-related attitudes, thereby demonstrating
concurrent validity.
Methods
Procedures
All data were sourced from the COVID-Dynamic dataset
1797 U.S. residents across 17 waves (Wave 1: April 4, 2020; Wave 17: July 24, 2021). For details
about participant recruitment, assessment schedule and testing procedures see Rusch et al.,
2023. The current study’s prespecified aims, hypotheses, and analysis plan can be found within
Participants
Our first goal was to validate the COVID-attitude data (see Exploratory Factor Analyses).
We included all 1447 participants from Wave 3, the first wave with complete attitude data. All
demographic descriptions are based on this sample. Five demographic variables were included:
three stable (sex at birth, age bracket, race) collected in Wave 1, and two variables (political
affiliation, weekly income) collected at every wave. The demographic breakdown at Wave 3 is
The second key analyses used regression models to examine how participants' context
and experiences predicted their COVID attitudes. To meet statistical assumptions, we included
participants who completed 10 or more waves (N = 945), excluded undersampled or undefined
race/ethnicity groups (race: “American Indian/Alaska Native”, ”Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific
Islander”, “Multiracial”, “Other”, ”Prefer not to disclose”; ethnicity: “Prefer not to disclose”), and
merged “countryside remote” and “countryside near town” into a single “countryside” group.

Measures
The COVID-Dynamic study used standard psychological assessments and measures
of pandemic-specific attitudes and experiences created by the COVID-Dynamic Team. Three
scales were specifically designed to assess COVID-related Attitudes. Additionally, we scraped
27–29
data from public sources to create United States county-level objective metrics of local
community COVID impacts specific to our participants.
Measures of COVID Attitudes
(1) COVID Health Concerns: four items, asking participants how concerned they were about
themselves and family members contracting COVID-19 and developing severe symptoms
from COVID-19. Response options were 1 = Not concerned at all; 2 = A little concerned;
3 = Somewhat concerned; 4 = Very concerned; 5 = Extremely concerned. For each
participant, mean scores were computed across all items, with higher scores indicating
greater concerns about COVID-19 infection and symptoms.
(2) COVID Norm Agreement: three items, each of which asked participants to rate agreement
(from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) with statements regarding how people
in their community should act e.g., strictly observe social distancing rules. Mean scores
across all items were calculated for each participant, with higher scores reflecting greater
socially normative attitudes towards COVID-19 prevention behaviors.
(3) Importance of COVID Restrictions: 18 items, e.g., closing schools, washing hands often,
wearing masks in public in response to the prompt, “For each item below, indicate how
important you think it is for preventing spread of COVID-19.” Response options were: 1 =
Necessary; 2 = Not necessary, but probably helpful; 3 = Probably not helpful; 4 = A major
over-reaction. All items were reverse-scored, and mean scores were calculated for each
participant, with higher means indicating stronger endorsement for the importance of
restrictions related to COVID-19.
Note, we characterized the dimensionality of these three attitudinal measures using exploratory
factor analysis (see Analyses - Exploratory Factor Analyses). For a list of all individual items see
Measures of Personal COVID Experiences and Behaviors
(1) COVID Health Impacts on Personal Social Network: Participants were asked to report on
the health status of individuals across eight social roles (spouse/partner, parent,
grandparent, sibling, aunt/uncle/cousin (third degree relative), child, friend/roommate,
work colleague), providing binary (yes/no) responses about COVID-19 health impact
questions (1 = Likely has COVID; 2 = Tested positive for COVID; 3 = Hospitalized” 4 =
Deceased). The COVID Health Impact score is the summation of maximum response
scores in all 8 social categories.
(2) Restrictions of Personal Behavior: 11 items that assessed participants’ behavioral changes
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., stopped going to the gym, stopped taking
public transportation, started wearing masks when leaving the house). Response options
were binary (yes/no) and responses were summarized by taking the average endorsement
rate.
(3) Personal Financial Situation: Participants were asked to report their income bracket in US-
Dollar each Wave (Less than $249; $250 - $499; $500 - $999; $1000 -$1499; $1500 -
$2999; more than $3000; Don't know). From Wave 7 onwards, we specified this query and
asked participants to separately report their personal as well as their household income.
At Wave 17 both the unspecific and the more specific query were included. Within-subject
correlation-analyses between both query types suggest that participants reported their
personal income in Wave 1-6 (r =0.91, r =0.57). For
unspecifc_personalIncome unspecifc_householdIncome
further analyses, we combined earlier responses with the specific personal income
reports, and transformed income brackets into numerical values by using their upper limits
(the highest bracket “more than $3000” was transformed to $4499). To align with other
COVID experience measures and local economic context (unemployment rates), we
inverted the numerical income variable by subtracting it from the overall maximum income
value included. Thus, higher values reflect a lower income.
Measures of Local Societal COVID Context
To contextualize participants’ self-report measures, we gathered and processed publicly available
US-county-level information paralleling our three Personal Experience measures:
(1) Local COVID Health: local COVID-case and death counts, 7-day averages per 100.000
population .
(2) Local COVID Restrictions: local COVID restrictions , including ordinally-scaled stay-at-
home orders (0 = No order for individuals to stay home to 5 = Mandatory for all individuals),
gathering bans (0 = No order found to 6 = Gatherings of any size banned), restaurant
closures (0 = Authorized to fully reopen to 3 = Closed), and bar closures (0 = Authorized
to fully reopen to 3 = Closed). We created a restriction summary score by summing over
all restriction types.
(3) Local Economic Situation: monthly local unemployment rates directly derived from the
bureau of labor statistics .
COVID context measures to participant location alignment
To align the Local COVID Context measures to participants’ wave-by-wave location, we
first determined participants' US-county of residence based on their survey responses. In Wave
1, participants reported their US-state of residence. From Wave 2 on, we asked participants for
the name of the town closest to their current place of residence (free-text response) and if they
had relocated since they last participated in the study (a yes response would prompt them to
update the U.S. state of residence). Additionally, in Waves 8, 9, 15, 16 and 17, we asked
participants to provide their 5-digit zip code. All location data was provided voluntarily and
participants could choose to withhold any information without any implications for their
participation in the study. To identify participants’ wave-by-wave county from the location
information available, we first preprocessed zip-code data and town/state of residence information
using a mixture of manual and automated steps. Second, using the US zip code package , for
each participant and wave we identified US-county of residence from US-state and town-names
provided by participants. Additionally, when zip-code data was available we determined the US-
anonymized code). Zip codes allow identifying counties with higher accuracy than via town and
state information. Therefore, we preferred county-by-zip code if available. To validate county-by-
state-and-town information, we compared counties identified via zip code and town and state data
and found a 73% overlap. By combining both approaches, we successfully identified 1585
participants’ wave-by-wave county of residence. For 212 participants county data was
unidentifiable. These participants were excluded from further analysis.
Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII)
The Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII) is a 92-item inventory of pandemic-
related experiences in which participants indicate whether each experience happened to them or
someone in their household. Summary results were generated by grouping items to domains
identified by Grasso et al. (2021), and creating a sum score comprised of the items answered
“yes” (to self or person-in-household) for each of the five domains: work/employment (7 items),
home life (13 items), social life/isolation (5 items), emotional/physical health and infection (15
items), and positive change (3 items).
Analyses
Exploratory Factor Analyses of COVID-19 Attitude Measures
Exploratory factor analyses (EFA) were used to examine the underlying dimensionality of,
and validate, the three novel attitudinal subscales (i.e., importance of restrictions, COVID health
concerns, and COVID norm agreement; all continuous response scales), using data at Wave 3,
the first wave when all relevant measures were collected). Maximum likelihood extraction and
promax rotation were used. The number of factors to retain was guided by review of scree plots
(see SI-Fig. 14-16) and eigenvalues above 1. Items were said to have stable factor loadings at
0.4 or higher and no other loadings greater than or equal to half of that loading . Missing data
was excluded listwise. EFA was conducted with SPSS version 28 .
Personal Experiences, Local Context, and Attitude Measures over Time
To visualize temporal variation in local COVID-19 context, we used maximum variation
sampling to select five exemplar US counties based on differences in COVID-19 case trajectories.
Counties were chosen to maximize the overall sum of Euclidean distance between selected
counties. The five counties' COVID case trajectories, local restrictions, and unemployment rates
are shown in Fig. 1A. We similarly visualized participants' COVID experiences (Fig. 1B) and
attitudes (Fig. 1C) by selecting maximally different trajectories for social network health impacts
and COVID health concerns.
Data Transformation preceding Regression Analyses
To explore the relations between personal pandemic experiences, community pandemic
impacts, demographic factors, and subjective attitudes we used multivariate regression analyses.
Prior to model implementation, to ensure comparability all continuous predictor and predicted
variables were z-transformed. Second, we examined the distribution of all dependent variables
and corrected skewed predicted variables with yeo-johnson transformations prior to model
implementation (see SI-Fig. 3-11 for raw and transformed data distributions).
Demographic Factors as Predictors of Local and Personal COVID Experiences
Previous studies have shown that the COVID pandemic impacted different demographic
34–36
groups in very different ways . Here, we examine how well data collected as part of the
COVID-Dynamic study replicates these findings. We tested whether (1) Local COVID context
subscales (county level COVID-case counts, COVID restrictions, and unemployment rates), and
(2) Personal COVID experiences subscales (COVID health impacts on participants’ social
network, safety-measures they adopted, and personal weekly income) could be predicted by
several demographic variables including sex assigned at birth, age, ethnicity, race, political party
affiliation, and population density at location of residence using multivariate regression analyses.
Demographic Factors, Local Context and Personal COVID Experiences as
Predictors of COVID Attitudes
To test if individuals’ COVID attitudes are predicted by individuals’ local COVID context,
personal COVID experiences or both, we conducted separate multivariate regression models for
each personal attitude measure, and each wave separately (i.e., 17 regression models per
attitude measure). Each regression model included all three local contexts and three personal
experience measures as predictor variables. Further, we included demographic predictor
variables (sex assigned at birth, age, ethnicity, race, political party affiliation, and population
density at location of residence) to control for the impact of demographic factors on COVID
attitudes.
Multicollinearity
Multicollinearity can undermine regression models, so we used a three-step approach to
assess it. First, Chi-square tests examined associations between categorical demographics
(Wave 3). Second, we calculated correlation ratios between demographics and continuous local
context and personal experience variables at each wave. Third, Pearson correlations assessed
multicollinearity among continuous variables. Results showed significant multicollinearity among
continuous variables (r < 0.4) and moderate to low multicollinearity among continuous variables
(r < 0.5) (Figures 2B, 2C).
To address the multicollinearity among the large number of predictor variables, we
employed Lasso regression models. Lasso models have an inherent variable selection capability
that allows us to refine our predictors for modeling COVID attitudes. Second, Lasso models are
efficient in handling multicollinearity, allowing for a more nuanced exploration of the relationships
between demographic factors, local context, personal experiences, and COVID attitudes.
Lasso Regression Models
The COVID-Dynamic dataset provides a longitudinal assessment of COVID experiences
and attitudes over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Here, we assessed whether
(1) local COVID context, and/or (2) personal COVID experiences, best predicted individuals’
COVID attitudes at the different timepoints. Additionally, we account for various demographic
factors (age, sex - reference category for categorical regressors (RC) male, race - RC White,
political party affiliation - RC Democrat, population density - RC countryside). We ran separate
Lasso regression models for each of the four attitude measures across all 17 waves, using the
scikit-learn library . The data was split into 80% training and 20% test sets with a stratified split
to preserve outcome proportions, ensuring evaluation on unseen data. A fixed seed was used for
reproducibility.
After exploring a broader range, we specified 100 evenly spaced alpha values from 1×10⁻⁶
to 0.5. The optimal alpha for each wave was determined via 10-fold cross-validation. We then
selected the mode of these wave-specific alpha values as the overall regularization parameter
(see SI-Figures 18 & 19 for alpha vs. model performance plots).The Lasso model was then fitted
to the training data, automatically selecting relevant predictors by shrinking some coefficients to
zero, simplifying the model. Finally, model performance was assessed on the test data using R-
squared values and residual plots (SI-Figures 17-19).
We also tested whether our dataset replicates prior findings on demographic factors' relationships
with local COVID context and experiences (e.g., higher COVID case counts in Republicans and
racial health disparities). Using the same Lasso regression approach, we predicted local COVID
case counts, unemployment, restrictions, and participants' COVID health impact, personal
restrictions, and weekly income based on the demographic variables listed above.

Results
Exploratory factor analyses of subjective COVID-attitude measures
The initial 18-item EFA for importance of restrictions suggested a four-factor solution, but
1 item (“disinfecting frequently touched surfaces at home”) cross-loaded onto multiple factors.
After removal, the EFA was performed again, yielding an additional cross-loaded item
(“disinfecting frequently touched surfaces in public places”). The third and final EFA for
importance of restrictions suggested a three-factor solution for the remaining 16 items (as shown
Factors reflected public restrictions (factor 1, 10 items, Cronbach’s ɑ = .901), large gatherings
(factor 2, 2 items, Cronbach’s ɑ = .927), and personal hygiene (factor 3, 4 items, Cronbach’s ɑ =
.723). The mean score for importance of restrictions at Wave 3 was 54.24 (SD = 4.48). One EFA
was performed for concerns about COVID infections, and all items were retained. The one-factor
solution explained 79% of the variance (goodness-of-fit test, χ2 = 962.95, p < .001). Mean scores
for concerns about COVID were 12.52 (SD = 4.14). Similarly, only one EFA was required for
COVID norms, which yielded a one-factor solution that explained 75% of the variance. The mean
score for COVID norms at Wave 3 was 13.63 (SD = 2.13).
At Wave 3, all five COVID attitudes measures as well as two measures of personal COVID
3), but there was no evidence of multicollinearity (rs < .70). Cronbach’s alpha for the newly
developed scales reflected good-to-excellent internal consistency for all COVID-related attitudes
(i.e., safety measures adopted, covid impacts). However, these scales were significantly
correlated with EPII subscales for work and employment, home life, social life and isolation,
convergent validity with existing pandemic-related measures.

Before conducting any further analyses of the delineated attitude measures, we explored
within-wave across-subject variance, and within-subject across-wave variance in each of the 5
factors derived through the prior EFA (3 factors for importance of restrictions, one factor each for
COVID health concerns and COVID norm agreement). Within-wave variance is illustrated in SI-

Local COVID impact, personal COVID experiences, and subjective
attitudes measures over time
COVID-Attitudes.
For each measure, we present five example US counties (A) or participants (B & C) (solid lines), with
averages across all counties or participants (dotted lines, shaded areas show the 95% data interval).
Exemplary cases were selected via maximum-variation sampling based on COVID case trajectories (A),
social network health impact (B), or COVID health concerns (C) to highlight participant variation. (A) Local
COVID context: 7-day average cases, local restrictions, and unemployment rates. (B) Participants' COVID
experiences: social network health impact, safety measures, and weekly income (reversed, i.e., higher
numbers indicate stronger negative economic experience). (C) Participants' COVID attitudes: health
concerns, norm agreement, and restriction importance.
Local Context Measures
Across the US, local COVID-impact varied strongly (Fig. 1A). For example, in the data
presented here, the earliest peak in COVID-cases was observed in New-York (Wave 1-4),
followed by a peak in California (Wave 6-9), a national peak (Wave 15), and an even later peak
in COVID-cases in Florida (Wave 17) (Fig. 1A left panel). Additionally, we observe that the within-
wave variance in county-level COVID case-counts is small in early waves, increases over time,
and peaks between Waves 14 to 17. This indicates that particularly during later waves,
participants’ local COVID-health experiences were more locally defined. In line with large public-
38–41
health analyses, we find that initially restrictions and COVID case-counts are marginally
positively rattled (wave 1-7: r =[0.12, 0.35]) and negatively related in later waves
localCVDhealth_localRestrict
(wave 8-14: r =[-0.42, -0.02]) (Fig. 2B), with evidence of regionally-specific
localCVDhealth_localRestrict
associations in case-count and restriction trajectories, (e.g., despite climbing case counts in
Nassau County, Florida towards Wave 17, restrictions in the county were not increased, whereas,
Imperial county in California saw a much smaller spike in cases around Wave 16 but responded
with a strong increase in COVID restrictions). Across all waves, we observe large between county
variance in restriction numbers, indicating that across all time points participants’ experiences of
public restrictions was strongly divergent.
Overall, unemployment rates followed a similar pattern across all counties and the linear
relationships with local COVID case-counts was similar to the relation of case counts and
restrictions with a positive relation in early waves, and a negative relation in later waves (wave
1-10: r =[0.07, 0.31], wave 11-15: r =[-0.27, -0.04]) (Fig. 2B).

Similarly, unemployment rates and restrictions co-varied moderately across most waves with a
dip in covariance between wave 8-11 (r =[-0.01-0.42]) (Fig. 2C), as unemployment
localRestrict_localEcon
rates dropped with relaxed restrictions. In contrast to local COVID case-counts, between county
variance in local unemployment numbers decreased mildly over time and was lowest in the latest
waves.
Self-reported personal COVID-experiences and behavior
Second, we examined the trajectories and relations between personal COVID-experience
and behavior measures (Fig. 1B). Overall, the impact of COVID on the health of people in
participants’ social networks increased continuously with time, yet individuals’ trajectories varied
(Fig. 1B, left panel), e.g., consistently low/ high (orange and light green lines), or abrupt changes
across time (pink, dark green and blue lines). Similar to local COVID-case counts, between-
participant variance in personal COVID health experiences was smallest in the initial waves and
remained high across later waves. On average, the number of safety measures adopted by
participants slowly decreased across waves (Fig. 1B, right panel), and participants’ average

COVID attitudes
On average all three COVID attitudes scales (Fig. 1C), follow similar trajectories: highest
attitude values during Wave 1, declining scores until Wave 7, secondary and tertiary peaks in
attitude scores around Wave 9 and Wave 15, followed by a continuous decline. Despite the
similarity in average attitude curves, individual participants show idiosyncratic trajectories across
all attitude measures.

Regression Analyses
Here we tested the predictive value of three classes of predictor variables on COVID attitudes:
(1) local context variables, (2) personal experience variables, and (3) demographic variables. Our
main focus was to explore the ability of local context versus personal experience variables to
predict subjective COVID attitudes. Demographic variables were included in order to control for
their contribution to COVID attitudes. We identified significant multicollinearity between several
demographic variables, as well as moderate correlation between some context variables; context
and Supplemental Information - Multicollinearity for details). To account for the large number of
predictor variables (20), and the presence of multicollinearity, we employed Lasso Regression.
Here, we only report predictors that were retained in more than 5 waves and had across-wave
mean regression coefficients of |β|≥0.05. For a complete list of all wave-by-wave regression
coefficients, see Fig. 3.
Overall, the best fitting regularization parameters were small: for the model predicting

models predicting COVID health concerns, 5/20 predictors met our reporting criteria of being

Discussion
Understanding the factors shaping individual responses to global emergencies like
COVID-19 is key to improving communication, informing policy, and mitigating future crises .
Research shows collective experiences, and personal histories significantly influence attitudes
and behaviors. Yet, discerning the separate impacts is complex due to their intertwined nature.
Using a unique dataset, we explored how individual and collective experiences converge to shape
attitudes and behaviors.
We derived three measures from the data to capture participants' attitudes on (1) COVID
infection concerns, (2) agreement with COVID norms, and (3) the importance of restrictions.
validity and reliability of these measures. Validity analyses showed strong convergent and
discriminant validity, and Cronbach’s alpha indicated high internal consistency with no
multicollinearity. Additionally, the new measures correlated with the EPII, confirming their
concurrent validity for assessing pandemic-related attitudes.
We then assessed the utility of our attitude measures through visualization and
assessment of across participant and wave variance. On average, all three attitudes were highest
at the start of the pandemic (early April of 2020), and decreased over time. However, individual
trajectories were highly variable, with some participants showing stable scores and others
fluctuating strongly across waves. Similarly, participants’ personal experiences with COVID
infections, personal economic situations, and individual restriction behavior, and participants’
local context, characterized via local COVID-case counts, unemployment numbers, and local
43–
restrictions, varied between participants and over time. Further, Consistent with prior research
, demographic factors influenced these dynamics, e.g., over time, the personal economic impact
at lowers rate for Hispanic vs. Non-Hispanic, and Asian and Black vs. White participants.
Together, these findings provide support for the utility of our measures.
Finally, We examined how personal experiences, local context, and demographics
predicted participants' COVID attitudes. Results showed that personal experiences, behaviors,
and demographics, but not local collective experiences, played a key role. Personal behavioral
restrictions predicted all attitudes, while economic pressure was linked to stronger norm
agreement and restriction importance, with higher economic pressure predicting stronger norm
agreement and restriction importance. Personal experiences with COVID infections predicted
COVID health concerns. Political affiliation most strongly influenced the perceived importance of
restrictions but only minimally predicted health concerns. In contrast, age and birth sex predicted
health concerns, but did not predict norm agreement and attitudes towards public restriction.
These observations underscore distinct qualitative differences between types of attitudinal
measures, and between social versus demographic identities. Political affiliation, as a marker of
social identity, predominantly influenced abstract societal norms, while demographic factors such
as age primarily pertain to immediate personal concerns like health fears. This suggests that the
influence of social identity on personal attitudes may be moderated by the directness of its impact
on an individual's life. Although these effects are stable across all waves, the models’ predictive
power increases across waves. This is likely due to lack of variance in early waves for many
measures, e.g. local case-counts and restrictions become more variable across countries towards
later waves as cases spike in different areas of the country, and restrictions are eased in some
places while others enact stronger limitations to behavior.

While there have been numerous studies on the COVID-19 pandemic in general ,
49,50
and on attitudes towards COVID-19 specifically , the data described here are unique for many
reasons. First, unlike many large COVID-related studies these data are within-participant and
longitudinal, affording greater inferential power and the ability to ask questions related to the
temporal dynamics of attitudes over time and in relation to important events (e.g., the murder of
George Floyd and subsequent Black Lives Matter protests, the 2020 US election, etc.). Second,
subjective attitudinal data are linked at the participant-level to a curated set of concrete and
geographically-localized data regarding the impact of COVID-19, and to the larger COVID-
Dynamic dataset, which contains a broad spectrum of assessments (e.g., standardized
psychological measures, task-based behavioral measures, media consumption, substance use,
etc.) that span many distinct psychological domains (e.g., social and moral decision-making,
mental health, personality, emotion, memory, etc.). Third, each of these datasets is freely
researchers the opportunity to interrogate them to answer their own research-program-specific
questions. In combination, these attributes enable researchers to explore the dynamics of
individual participants' behavior and mental health within various levels of personal and societal
contexts. This multi-level approach may enhance the understanding of how personal experiences
and broader social factors interact to influence behavior and mental health in multiple contexts.
It is important to note some limitations. Data were collected from the Prolific pool of online
volunteers, who often differ from the general population. They tend to be younger, more educated,
more politically liberal, and may experience higher levels of depression, anxiety, and social
51–53
isolation . This self-selection bias may affect the data's representativeness, though efforts
were made to minimize these biases during recruitment (see Methods Rusch et al., 2023). Finally,
analysis of attrition (low completion rate and exclusion for poor data quality) over the course of
the COVID-Dynamic study has indicated some biases among certain demographic groups,
features limit the generalizability of these data, we note that few datasets are comprehensive
enough to assess sample composition in this manner and suggest that known issues are
preferable to unknown issues. Additionally, the within-participant design, where participants serve
as their own comparison, helps mitigate sample composition concerns.
Another limitation of the dataset stems from the temporal sparseness of sampling, i.e., not
some aspects of analysis and limits the questions that can be asked. In addition, measures are
not independent, leading to potential multicollinearity. We advise users to review the data
collection schedule and assess variables for multicollinearity. Additionally, we note that our
regression analyses do not reveal causality; for example, while personal behavior predicts
attitudes, attitudes may also influence behavior. Lastly, findings should be considered exploratory
and verified through follow-up studies whenever possible.
Understanding how human attitudes adapt to adverse environmental changes is crucial
for enhancing public communication and shaping effective policies aimed at safeguarding
psychological well-being. Opportunities to capture a comprehensive snapshot of the multitude of
factors influencing human behavior under dynamic conditions are exceedingly rare. The COVID-
19 pandemic provided such a unique opportunity. Our novel, targeted, and validated COVID
attitude measures surprisingly suggest that while personal attitudinal changes are influenced by
individual adverse experiences, demographic factors, and social identities, they are significantly
less influenced, if at all, by the measured societal experiences. These findings have meaningful
implications for a diverse range of issues at both the personal and societal levels, from treatment
development to future pandemic protocols and policy development. We believe these openly
available data, in combination with the rich and extensive COVID-Dynamic dataset, will offer
researchers from a wide range of disciplines the tools to elucidate individual and societal
influences on social, behavioral, and mental health.
