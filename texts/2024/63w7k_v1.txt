1. Introduction
Joko Widodo, commonly known as "Jokowi," rose to prominence through a remarkable political journey. Born in
the working-class city of Solo, he served as the Mayor of Solo from 2005 to 2012 before being elected as the
Governor of Jakarta in 2012. As Governor, Widodo gained national attention for his hands-on, with his populism-
reformist approach to governance, championing infrastructure projects and social safety-net program, called
Bansos. Widodo's outsider status and image as a man from the people, with the term “Rakyat adalah Kita” (we
are the people,- I am) helped propel him to the presidency in 2014, when he won a hard-fought election against
His extraordinary rise from the riverside slum where he grew up to become Indonesia's president shows how far
the world's third-largest democracy has strayed from the brutal authoritarian era of previous decades. When his
second and final five-year term ends in October 2024, President Jokowi is considered by some to be Asia's Barack
Obama leaving behind a legacy of impressive economic growth and many of ambitious infrastructure projects,
including plans to shift Indonesia's crowded capital to the border region in East Kalimantan at a cost of $33 billion.
Asian Institute of Research Journal of Social and Political Sciences Vol.7, No.4, 2024
As president, Widodo has sought to cement his legacy through ambitious infrastructure initiatives, such as the plan
to relocate Indonesia's capital city, as well as efforts to reduce poverty and inequality across the archipelago (Tyson
& Apresian 2021). During the first days of his first term as President of Indonesia, Jokowi started building a
reputation as a soft-spoken reformer and promised to fight poverty and inequality by harnessing Indonesia's
extraordinary resources and tourism attractions to boost the economy of Indonesia, the largest country in the
Southeast (Muhtadi 2015). He is also considered as a political lightweight by his rivals in Asia.
Taking the power as the President of the Republic of Indonesia, Jokowi, is known as a person who uses political
symbols in various situations. In many of his political manoeuvres, he took the advantages of implied symbols of
how good he is, which President Jokowi carried out internal consolidation and carried out a lot of underground
political communication with various community organizations and political parties (De Ferrari 2017). During
pandemic, according to Fealy (2020), President Jokowi may need assistants who do a lot of new things and work
instead of acting in a way full of drama. Thus, he will easily consider replacing people who, according to him, are
unable to solve problems and also people who like to create controversy in the public sphere.
When COVID-19 pandemic started to hit Indonesia, the country encountered the threat of the worst recession that
confronted President Jokowi in 2020 (Fealy 2020). In the same year, his government faced many internal problems,
from controlling the pandemic in the health sector to saving the economy, which was peppered with legal problems
and corruption that ensnared several of his ministers. Two of his ministers resigned due to legal issues. First, Edhy
Prabowo resigned from his position as Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, and then Juliari Batubara
resigned from his position as Minister of Social Affairs.
Owing to this unfavourable situation, President Jokowi had to immediately act and make decisions after facing
two serious challenges for too long because of the corruption case involving his two ministers, public trust in the
government has also decreased. Apart from that, President Jokowi considers political considerations profitable by
accepting proposals from community organizations and political parties. For example, consider certain positions
that have been abandoned by previous officials affiliated with a particular political party. For example, the
Gerindra Party lost Edhy Prabowo as Minister while Sandiaga Uno served as Minister of Tourism and Creative
Economy of the Republic of Indonesia, while Wishnutama was discharged.
President Jokowi also gave support to the National Awakening Party, the Ansor Youth Movement, and Nadhlatul
Ulama to return as Minister of Religion. Tri Risma Harini, the most respected member of the Partai Demokrasi
Indonesia Perjuangan, immediately picked up Juliari's place. President Jokowi to applied symbolic politics as a
way of communicating and an approach to observing the reactions of his political competitors and colleagues. The
way President Jokowi acts always invites different views and beliefs from politicians in Indonesia, as seen in his
first cabinet reshuffle during the second term of his administration.
With a lot of political moves he made, Jokowi was forced to face his enemies and political supporters who were
trying to gain influence and apply pressure. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, an unnoticed cabinet reshuffle
would cause unwanted uncertainty. Regarding the national capital called Nusantara, President Jokowi stated that
the construction of Ibu Kota Nusantara (IKN) as the new National Capital of the Archipelago was a big step
towards transformation towards an advanced Indonesia (Purwaningsih & Widodo 2020). The capital of the
Archipelago will truly show the greatness of the Indonesian nation and reflect national identity, guarantee social,
economic, and environmental sustainability, and build a forest city, smart city, and advanced city.
Jokowi also made progress on social development goals, increasing access to healthcare and education, and
implementing programs aimed at reducing poverty and inequality (Purwaningsih & Widodo 2020). His
administration's flagship initiative, the Universal Health Coverage (JKN) program, extended basic healthcare
services to most of the Indonesia's population. However, Jokowi's presidency was also marked by significant
controversies and policy failures. The plan to relocate Indonesia's capital from Jakarta to East Kalimantan, for
instance, faced heavy public backlash due to its immense cost and potential environmental impact.
Asian Institute of Research Journal of Social and Political Sciences Vol.7, No.4, 2024
Jokowi believes that the National Capital of the Archipelago will represent a superior nation. Apart from that, the
National Capital of the Archipelago is proof of Indonesia's commitment to tackling climate change. This is
demonstrated by achieving and managing various indicators to achieve net zero carbon and 100% new renewable
energy by 2060. This shows a transformation in smart, creative, connected and integrated work (Sahide 2022).
However, when Jokowi left his post as president, many people, including those who supported him, accused the
furniture entrepreneur of combining "oligarchy" and intending to maintain power by preparing his eldest son,
Gibran Rakabuming Raka, to run for the 2024 Presidential Election (Fatimatuzzahra & Dewi 2021).
At this point, the level of public satisfaction with President Jokowi's performance is still above 50%. However,
disillusioned voices and a breakdown in relations with the Partai Demokrasi Indonesia Perjuangan (PDIP) have
reduced this level of public satisfaction. President Jokowi appeared to be very careful in his actions and often took
advantage of the situation to make the best decisions even when receiving setbacks from Machfud MD as
Coordinating Minister for Politics, Law and Security of the Republic of Indonesia during the contestation for the
Presidential Election of the Republic of Indonesia for the 2024-2029 period, and appointed Agus Harimurti
Yudhoyono, the Chief of Democrat Party as Minister of Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning/Head of the
National Land Agency of the Republic of Indonesia and Hadi Tjahtjanto as Coordinating Minister for Politics,
Law and Security of the Republic of Indonesia, replacing Machfud MD who had resigned from his post as the
Coordinating Minister for Politics, Law and Security.
Currently, the level of public satisfaction with Jokowi turns out to be high, according to data released by several
compared to before the election (Detik.com, 2024). Data from the Indonesian Survey Institute regarding public
satisfaction with Jokowi is currently not much different from Indikator about 76.2% (Tempo.co 2004). Despite
this high public satisfaction, Jokowi faced critical voices from academic groups from various universities in
Indonesia, and from civil society groups, especially with regards to the controversy over the nomination of his
son, Gibran, as running-mate to Prabowo.
Jokowi's relationship with his party, namely PDI P, also experienced a breakdown. Mahfud MD, Coordinating
Minister for Politics, Law and Security, who has been long supporter of Jokowi also resigned. Facing this situation,
Jokowi's skill and caution as a politician was visible. One of the steps taken by Jokowi was to invite Agus Harimurti
Yudhoyono (AHY), Top Chair of the Democrat Party, which was previously known as the government's
opposition, to step into the cabinet. This is interpreted as Jokowi's attempt to consolidate his power with Democrat
Party which previously had launched criticisms on many of Jokowi’s political moves and administration. AHY’s
appointment as Minister of Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning/National Land Agency in February 2024 has
placed Democrat Party’s in Jokowi’s embrace.
This research aims to analyse President Jokowi’s trait as the new master political symbols in Indonesia. However,
Joko Widodo's presidency has not been without its challenges to faced criticism from political rivals who accuse
him of autocratic tendencies and favoritism towards his own political network; this is reflected in the
overwhelming political endorsement for his family members in political practice (Abdurrahman et al. 2021).
Allegations of corruption scandals involving his cabinet ministers have also threatened to undermine his reformist
image at times.
Beyond concerns about cronyism, Widodo has also drawn heavy criticism for perceived attempts to establish a
political dynasty by grooming his son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, for a future leadership role. Gibran's successful
bid for Vice President, after previously serving as mayor of Solo in 2020, the same city where Widodo himself
once served as mayor, has fuelled allegations that the president is engaged in an undemocratic transfer of power
between himself and his family members. This has resonated with segments of the Indonesian public who are wary
of entrenched political elites perpetuating their hold on power (Tyson & Apresian 2021).

2. Literature Review
In simple terms, political networking is described as a relationship graph that shows the relationship between
different objects that are politically symmetrical and asymmetrical (Mcclurg 2003; Slater & Simmons 2012). In
political networking, political objects can choose their own path of connection (discretionary), group based on the
bias of similar characteristics between political objects (assortative mixing), or form reciprocal relationships
(Gupta & Chauhan 2023). In a political party, it is easy to see how its members form relationships, group them,
and whether the relationships formed are reciprocal (Kahne & Bowyer, 2018). Apart from that, Kahne & Bowyer
(2018) also explained that many interesting concepts can be found in political networking theory, such as
modularity, efficiency, centrality, degree, and betweenness.
Having a political networking perspective instilled in oneself can help to see and predict the dynamics of world
complexity more accurately (Kahne & Bowyer 2018). With better understanding, political networking can see
how political views, interests, wealth, and hoaxes spread (Mcclurg 2003). In different circumstances, political
networking sometimes acts not in accordance with its habits so that if it is not ideal, then political networking will
move on the wrong path and is difficult to correct (Gupta & Chauhan 2023). In building a political network in
which there are individuals and/or groups, symbols are needed for demonstrating the similarity of interests among
individuals and/or groups who are members of one network.
Symbols also play a role in identifying a person or group that has different interests from other groups.
Theoretically, symbols are important for organizing human interests for the fact that symbols serve to shape one's
perception and worldview. In the arena of political contestation and/or power struggle, symbols play a role in
shaping and/or building a person's or group's interpretation, such as self-image and so on. In politics, symbols also
facilitate a person or group to identify themselves and show a different position from other parties. In other words,
symbols can mobilize hostile political factions indicating that these symbols are also central elements in the
struggle for power (Gill & Ferrandez 2020).
Political communication is communication related to political messages and political actors or related to power,
government, and government policies (Himelboim et al. 2012; Bode 2016). Kubin & Sikorski (2021) stated that
people involved in political activities try to influence and encourage other people to carry out political activities
at the level of infrastructure and superstructure relations. According to McNair (2017), political communication
includes the exchange of symbols, words, images, movements, body attitudes, mannerisms, and clothing.
In a broader sense, political communication is the activity of exchanging messages carried out by a person, group
of people, or institution to gain strength to defend the people, both as implementers of government and as members
of social society who can influence policies in various parts of the power or government system (Miller &
McKerrow 2010). It is also necessary to understand that political communication is a field that investigates
communication behavior and activities that are politically charged, with political consequences, and influence
political behavior and activities (Serazio 2017). Political communication can also be defined as a communication
process that has an impact on political action (Medveschi & Frunza 2018).
3. Methods
The type of literature study in this research employed in this research is the narrative review model to compare
data from several global journals, which are summarized based on the author's experience, existing theories and
models. The research method is a qualitative, with examined secondary data made available as source data. By
collecting, identifying, compiling, and analyzing the various information found, researchers make use of analytical
descriptive techniques (Berger 2014). An automatic search engine is benefitted to search for reference journals,
which considers several factors, such as the indexer's reputation, the publisher's reputation, suitability of content,
and completeness of searchable journal data (Snyder, 2019).
At the reference journal selection stage, the quality of the reference journal, the indexer's reputation, and the
publisher's reputation are considered (Creswell & Poth 2018). Data analysis is the process of systematically
Asian Institute of Research Journal of Social and Political Sciences Vol.7, No.4, 2024
searching and arranging data, categorizing it, and making conclusions from the data (Berger 2014). The author
conducted literature research by getting related and relevant information from several international journals with
previous research for assessing President Jokowi as Indonesia's new main political symbols which provides more
details on the specific steps involved in the narrative review process.
Such as how the relevant journals were identified, the methods used to extract and synthesize the data from those
journals, and the conceptual frameworks or analytical lenses that guided the literature analysis. After analyzing
the data, the author continues by interpreting and synthesising the literature findings to answer the research
Source: Berger, 2014
Data in this research were collected from secondary sources such as articles written by Aspinall (2013),
Fatimatuzzahra & Dewi (2021), Muhtadi (2015), Raharjo (2016) and others, in addition to online media news
sources such as Detik and Tempo. The researchers obtained data consisting of Jokowi's political strategies related
to the way he consolidates power, builds self-image and how public satisfaction has been formed out of his political
performance. The researcher then analyzed the data with various theories, such as political networks (Mcclurg
2003; Slater & Simmons 2012), and others, as well as political communication theory (Himelboim et al. 2012;
Bode 2016; Kubin & Sikorski 2021).
In addition, researchers also analyzed the data obtained with symbol and political theory (Gill and Ferrandez 2020).
From the critical dialogue that is carried out simultaneously between the phenomenon and the theory, the
researcher then tried to answer the problem and/or build conclusions regarding Jokowi's political strategy in using
political symbols as a medium for political communication to build political networks on the one hand, and identify
himself as having a different political position or interest from other parties in the future.
4. Result
A series of successes of President Jokowi that have been successfully carved in the implementation of the
Government of the Republic of Indonesia are certainly inseparable from his own leadership style and model. This
Asian Institute of Research Journal of Social and Political Sciences Vol.7, No.4, 2024
leadership style and model is none other than charismatic. In the theory of charismatic leadership according to
Klein & Delegach (2023), it is stated that a leader who is called charismatic is a leader who has followers who
make heroic attributions or extraordinary leadership abilities when they observe certain behaviors. A charismatic
leader has an unusual influence on his followers (Banks et al. 2017).
Kaluza et al. (2020) stated that followers of this charismatic leader believe that the leadership adopted by their
leader is correct, obey their leader without question, have emotional involvement in the mission of the group or
organization, believe that they can contribute to or the success of their mission, and have goals for good
performance. Naturally, while we reflect on the past, we also recall President Soekarno's charismatic leadership
style and model. The spirit of revolution that led to independence, the successful formation of the non-aligned
movement (NAM) at the Asia-Africa Conference in Bandung in 1955, the unification of West Papua into the
Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia (NKRI), and other notable accomplishments were all made possible by
President Soekarno's leadership style and model.
This does not, however, imply that the charismatic leadership model and style is the sole one that is most suited
for Indonesian leaders suited by Joko Widodo. The collaboration pact was not signed by 16 nations, despite his
charismatic leadership. Because President Jokowi's measures encourage industry to downstream so that the natural
resources exported would eventually have a high selling value, they are highly commendable. Indonesia is
undoubtedly in a better position to control different global trade policies because of this circumstance.
Furthermore, President Jokowi will make use of all the potential of both natural and human resources to optimize
the benefits for Indonesia's trade sector in the rapidly expanding global arena.
Reducing economic inequality and economic growth will be President Jokowi's main priorities during his initial
term (Davidson 2015). During this term, infrastructure would be a major concern and remain a key policy focus
for the next five years. Research results from Sibarani (2018) concluded that President Jokowi stated that
infrastructure and human resource development would be a top priority and acknowledged the failure to develop
Indonesia's workforce and Indonesia's failure to attract investment from other Southeast Asian countries. Jokowi's
presidency has had a mixed legacy, with both significant achievements and notable failures. On the positive side,
he oversaw a period of steady economic growth, with Indonesia's GDP expanding by an average of around 4-5%
per year during his time in office.
This was driven in part by his focus on infrastructure development, with major projects such as the Jakarta-
Bandung high-speed rail line and the expansion of Indonesia's seaport and airport capacity, even though the
projects have faced controversies among people due to their high costs and use of state budgets. Overall, Joko
Widodo's legacy is a complex one, with both notable achievements and significant shortcomings (Tyson &
Apresian 2021). While he oversaw a period of steady economic growth and made some progress on social
development, his presidency was also marred by controversies, authoritarian tendencies, and failures to address
pressing issues facing the country. Assessments of his tenure will likely continue to be shaped by these competing
narratives.
President Jokowi is known for frequently making use of political symbols in various situations that he implied in
many of his political manoeuvres. As a result, President Jokowi carried out internal consolidation and a lot of
underground political communication with various community organizations and political parties so that tactically
he was always successful in building political networks both at home and abroad (Abdurrahman et al. 2021). In
carrying out a mental revolution to encourage the manufacturing sector it will be very important to overcome rigid
labor laws that hinder investment with strong political support from Partai Demokrasi Indonesia Perjuangan
(PDI-P) and the coalition of parties supporting the government has some insurmountable political obstacles.
In addition, President Jokowi has indicated that he would open new sectors accessible to international investment,
but the details were not yet clear (Warburton 2016). The foreign investment coordinating body will clearly be
upgraded to become an optimal ministry task. This will likely bring greater attention to key cabinet reform issues.
Additionally, in recent months, the idea of moving Indonesia's capital from Jakarta to East Kalimantan, which had
Asian Institute of Research Journal of Social and Political Sciences Vol.7, No.4, 2024
been debated for decades, has gained significant momentum so it was likely that this policy would consume a lot
of time, attention, and resources in Jakarta, and even disrupted reform.
In political networking, political centrality serves as most important factor which also shows the cohesiveness of
the network. Political centrality is the main goal that must be aimed at if one wishes to change the culture of a
political organization or prevent the spread of social ills within it. In other words, the survival of a political network
is highly dependent on the political level of the network within it. Political degree is a term used to indicate how
close the relationship between two or more parties is when forming political cooperation and consolidation to
interact directly with other political objects in networking.
As mentioned earlier, the shortest path that connects the outermost objects of a network is called "betweenness."
A high number of betweennesses indicates better control over the network, while a low number of betweennesses
indicates no good control over the network. Modularity, or modularity, is a measure of how important a structure
is in a network. A political network that is very modular means that the political network is easy to connect with
other parties, while political networking that is less modular tends to be more difficult to connect with other
political networks.
As a leader, President Jokowi's has earned very large influence extraordinary political strategic abilities to
determine every step of infrastructure development, developments in global political and social economic
conditions, progress in resources and technological innovations that are recognized by many countries in the world.
He adopts very precise political strategic intelligence and has almost never failed in running the government so
far. Political strategy is an art that involves the ability to utilize all available resources to utilize them and achieve
goals by obtaining maximum and efficient profits. Mature democracies typically have outgoing presidents who
support the incoming one. Usually, the endorsement comes from an incumbent president who is no longer eligible
to run for office because of legal limitations.
For example, once Hillary Clinton won the Democratic Party's nomination for the 2016 election, President Obama
of the Democratic Party was forced to support her. In Indonesia, which has only conducted four direct presidential
elections, this has not yet evolved into a political ritual. As his second term ended, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
(SBY), the former president of Indonesia and its sixth-elected leader, declined to support a candidate in the next
presidential election. Given that a celebrity endorser is someone who has achieved notoriety and utilizes it to sell
a product by utilizing it to appear with them, Jokowi, as president, falls into this category.
In addition to well-known actors and actresses, other categories of celebrities that serve as endorsers include
athletes, politicians, corporate executives, artists, and members of the armed forces. But the focus of this piece is
on Jokowi's presidential communication, not on his role as a celebrity advocate or influencer or its consequences.
Political strategy is the art of using the means of battle to achieve war goals. Political strategy itself is a way that
has been understood and planned to achieve certain political goals in the long term. Political strategic planning
also includes a comprehensive analysis of the state of regional power, a clear picture of the final goals to be
achieved, and the concentration of all forces used to achieve these goals (Purwaningsih & Widodo 2020).
To some extent, political strategy is utilized to achieve various political goals such as new regulations, new
administrative structures, or deregulation, privatization, or decentralization programs (Kauppinen-Räisänen 2014).
Experience shows that such actions are usually not well planned by parliamentarians and governments. Otherwise,
many projects will fail. The absence of a strategic supervisory institution shows that there is no strategic planning
within the scope of government and administration. In addition, political strategy is important for political
campaigns and governments but also for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are active in politics (Knoll
et al. 2020).
All non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including environmental groups, labor unions, human rights
organizations, etc. To achieve long-term goals, there needs to be a political plan. Without a political plan, various
changes or large projects would not happen at all. For example, an effective planning process is required for
decentralization programs, such as implementing regional levels of government or regional autonomy. Authority,
Asian Institute of Research Journal of Social and Political Sciences Vol.7, No.4, 2024
organization, budget, and election of people's representatives are some of the elements that must be considered
when making plans where overall planning for long-term strategies can be avoided (Aspinall 2013).
Mukti & Rodiyah (2020) explained that strategic planning in political change and processes consists of a
comprehensive analysis of various states of power as well as a clear picture of the final goal to be achieved and
the concentration of all forms of power to achieve it. It is not surprising that many projects fail if the legislature
does not support the executive in implementing strategic policies but continues to question the objectives of these
policies (Aspinall 2015). Often, these so-called "good" politicians are responsible for social conditions that cause
millions of people to suffer, because they try to implement ambitious plans without strategy.
According to dramaturgical theory, society functions as the front stage in a play. Gray et al. (2024) stated that
dramaturgy has also been used to understand organizational processes because "backstage" can influence
provider's actions and society's experiences. Social interactions formed by people with various statuses and roles
form the front stage (Argyle 2012). All the games on that stage are bound by their own motives and goals.
Meanwhile, the front stage is the place where people see the actors in action. On the other hand, according to
Kerrigan & Hart (2016) the activities and characters of actors that cannot be seen by the audience are called
backstage, which setting and personal front are part of the front stage.
As for the settings in question, they are real things that actors use to play their roles. Dramaturgical theory analyzes
the personal front in addition to the setting (O’boyle 2022). The personal front consists of various equipment used
to communicate or introduce the actor's role to the audience. The equipment is adapted to the role played by the
actor. Impression management theory and other theories originate from dramaturgical theory. Everyone tries to
present themselves in social interactions. According to Indarti et al. (2020), in this impression management effort,
people deliberately use communication to create the impression others want of them. This is in accordance with
the dramaturgical theory mentioned previously, which states that actors play their roles on stage according to the
goals they have set.
Self-presentation theories from dramaturgy and impression management produce methods that people use to
present themselves and create an impression in the eyes of others. Types of self-presentation according to Hamid
et al. (2022) are as follows: 1.) Ingratiation strategy with which people who want to be seen as good or friendly;
2.) Self-promotion strategy with which people who want to be seen as intelligent people; 3.) Exemplification
strategy, people who want to be seen as a good organization or person to be an example or model for others; 4.)
Supplication strategy, which is usually applied by organizations or individuals who cannot help society, where the
individual shows himself as a weak party and a victim of the crisis; 5.) Intimidation strategy, which individuals
apply as to be considered and strong capable of controling the situation.
5. Discussion
President Jokowi as developed symbolic politics as a way of communicating and an approach to observing the
reactions of his political competitors and colleagues. The current political socialization process uses social media
in addition to broadcast media, print media and the internet. The next generation, which is dominated by young
people, seeks information on politics and presidential elections, including profiles of presidential candidates,
through tools such as smartphones, the internet, and social networks (Fulton & Kibby 2017).
Research results from Forgas & Williams (2016) illustrated that young people admit that searching for information
on politics via social media, such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and social networks, has a different
sensation compared to getting one via the internet. President Jokowi benefits from the media to portray his image
of all his abilities and personality of Indonesian presidents with Javanese culture, particularly the relationship
between strategic presidential communication, character, and the way presidents utilize their authority
(Abdurrahman et al. 2021; Tyson & Apresian 2021).
The communication style of Jokowi has been the subject of several research. claims, for instance, that Jokowi has
a low-context communication style and appears to have a profoundly impactful communication style that is open,
Asian Institute of Research Journal of Social and Political Sciences Vol.7, No.4, 2024
domineering, gregarious, aggressive, and highly energetic. Social media is an ideal platform for conducting
political campaigns because it is a cheaper communication tool than broadcasting and print media (Abdullah et al.
2021). On the other hand, the use of social media in political campaigns must be planned in accordance with
Campaigns, in this sense, are persuasive activities carried out gradually, deliberately, and repeatedly over a certain
period (Serazio, 2017). According to Fealy (2020), one way to do this by uploading photos in which he shakes
hands with people, hands over free t-shirts or books, directly slips cash in envelope to people’s palms and has a
char with the crowd he meets which directly conveys simplicity, social harmony, and closeness to the people.
Political communication is very strategic during the political process. Through political communication activities,
various political structures, including the executive, legislative, judiciary, political parties, non-governmental
organizations, interest groups, media, and citizens, continue to be involved in the process of exchanging meaning.
Political communication can include gathering interests, conveying, and receiving aspirations, negotiation,
socialization, campaigns, lobbying, and much more. Political communication is simply about how public resources
such as income, taxes, or earnings are distributed, who has the authority to create, make, and enforce laws, and
what the government does (Goyanes et al. 2021). Conceptually according to Goyanes et al. (2021), there are three
models of political communication, including:
1.) Systemic Model. This model is a complete political communication pattern consisting of interconnected
parts. The theory underlying this model consists of a collection of statements relating to the relationship
between dependent and independent variables which are considered to interact with each other.
2.) Process Model. The simultaneous transaction model is closely related to the dynamics of political
communication. This model shows three components that influence the communication process because
of its non-linear nature. In the end, a political communication process model will be built from this
communication system.
3.) Effectiveness Model. A character's ability to be a good listener, the ability to send good messages or
information, and the ability to use various media or audio-visual tools are all important components of
effective communication.
Some scholars are interested in and have examined presidential communication in the context of Indonesian
presidents with Javanese culture, particularly the relationship between strategic presidential communication,
character, and the way presidents utilize their authority. The communication style of Jokowi has been the subject
of several research. Jokowi, according to Mattingly & Yao (2022), has a low-context communication style and
communicates in a way that is open, domineering, friendly, aggressive, and highly energetic, leaving a lasting
impression. Raharjo (2016), on the other hand, looked at Jokowi's communication style and discovered that he
mixes his approach as a doer and an influencer.
Anderson (2019) argued in his observation that Indonesia's political processes and structures are essentially distinct
since Javanese culture predominates there. According to Anderson (2019), the Javanese people understand
(political) power as something that is morally neutral, uniform, solid, and consistent in its overall magnitude. First,
according to Anderson (2019), a fundamental idea of Javanese political theory is "Power is Concrete." Power is
present regardless of who could utilize it. This is not a theoretical postulate, but an existential fact. The enigmatic,
heavenly, and ethereal force that governs the cosmos is called power.
The next concept is "power is homogeneous," which suggests that all power has the same characteristics and comes
from the same source. One person or group's possession of power is equal to that of any other individual or group.
According to Anderson, the third notion of power in Javanese culture is "The quantum of power in the universe is
constant," which holds that both the overall quantity of power contained in the universe and its expansion or
contraction are fixed. Its overall number remains constant, even while the distribution of power in the universe
fluctuates, since power just exists and is not the product of organization, riches, weaponry, or anything else; in
fact, it precedes all of these and makes them what they are.

Using the concepts of political public relations, soft propaganda, and official communication, one might interpret
President Jokowi's comments on his endorsement of the next presidential candidate from a different angle
(Abdurrahman et al. 2021). The management process by which an actor for political purposes, through
communication and action, seeks to influence and to establish, build, and maintain beneficial relationships and
reputations with key publics and stakeholders to help support its mission and achieve its goals is how political
communication work. Jokowi was known for his savvy use of political symbols and communication tactics during
his presidency. He often relied on "implied symbols" and "symbolic politics" to connect with the Indonesian public
and project a populist image.
One of Joko Widodo's signature moves was his use of informal, man-of-the-people attire, such as his trademark
checkered shirts and jeans. Nowadays, he wore long rolled sleeves more often, to show a worker, not the president.
This was in stark contrast to the suits and formal wear traditionally favored by Indonesian political elites. By
dressing down, Jokowi aimed to portray himself as a relatable, accessible leader who was in touch with the
common citizen. Jokowi also made a point of frequently interacting with the public, staging impromptu visits to
markets, villages, and other grassroots settings.
These "blusukan" events, as they were known, allowed him to be seen mingling with ordinary Indonesians, shaking
hands, and addressing their concerns directly. This helped cultivate an image of Jokowi as a leader who was
responsive to the people's needs. Additionally, Jokowi frequently invoked the legacy of Indonesia's founding
president, Sukarno, tapping into nationalist sentiments and the country's revolutionary past. He would often make
references to Sukarno's ideals of political sovereignty and economic self- reliance, framing his own agenda as a
continuation of that nationalistic vision.
Ultimately, the legacy of Jokowi's presidency will be shaped not only by his policy achievements and failures, but
also by the ways in which he leveraged political symbolism and communication to forge his image and relationship
close to the people, humble, and tries to show his concern for the lower class, is a political symbol which explains
why he is so popular. Jokowi is clearly aware of his popularity, as shown in various data that show that people's
voting behavior in Indonesia is more determined by one’s figures. In the 2024 political contest, Jokowi really took
advantage of his popularity to support Gibran to run as a vice-presidential candidate.
When asked about his son running for the vice-presidential candidate, Jokowi's implicit message such as "As a
father I can only wish for the best [for Gibran]" is perceived to be indication of his political support. On various
occasions, Jokowi has also shown symbols that can be interpreted that his is in difference stance with the PDI P,
the party that supported him. For example, when Jokowi was seen eating with Prabowo Subianto, the presidential
candidate to whom Gibran is running-mate, Jokowi was also seen to be showing his closeness to Prabowo. Jokowi's
support for Prabowo can also be traced back to the way the Jokowi placed some favour to the pro-Jokowi group
led by Budi Arie who turned out to be clearly in support of Prabowo.
The party chaired by his youngest son, namely PSI, is also part of the coalition that supports Prabowo-Gibran
candidacy, On the other hand, Jokowi's popularity is also widely recognized by several parties and therefore,
without hesitation, support Jokowi's political agendas which consolidate and/or expand power and also leave a
great legacy; parties such as PAN and PSI for example, claim themselves to be "Jokowi's Party" and/or "A Party
Close to Jokowi" in hoping that they will get a positive effect from such popularity. Based on the analysis of

6. Conclusion
The results of this research conclude that President Jokowi as the new master politic of symbols has developed
three identified main capabilities, namely: firstly, in political networking, political centrality is most important. It
is the main goal of network cohesiveness in case one wishes to change the culture of political organizations or
prevent social diseases from spreading; secondly, President Jokowi's influence as a leader is very large, and he
has developed extraordinary political strategic abilities to determine every step of infrastructure development,
development of global political and social economic conditions, progress in resources and technological
innovation which are recognized by many countries in the world; thirdly, President Jokowi applies symbolic
politics as a way of communicating and an approach to observing the reactions of his competitors and political
colleagues.
One way to measure how well information is exchanged in political networking effectively and efficiently. Often,
the level of efficiency of a network is determined by how rapidly information flows through its channels, also
known as edges. The faster the flow of political information, the more efficient political networking will operate.
As all power originates from a single homogenous source and the question of good versus evil comes before the
question of power, "Power does not raise the question of legitimacy." Legitimate and illegitimate power are not
synonymous. The reason this idea is utilized in this context is that Anderson's idea was thought to be among the
most effective approaches to comprehend Indonesian politics. To achieve various political goals, such as new
regulations, new administrative systems, or deregulation, privatization, or decentralization initiatives, strategic
politics are employed.
