Acknowledgements
Firstly, I acknowledge the Turrbal and Jagera people as traditional owners and their
custodianship of the lands on which I lived and worked to write this thesis. I would like to
thank my Honours supervisor, Dr. Michael Thai. It has been an absolute pleasure working on
research projects with him over the past few years. I have learnt so much over that time and
truly developed a passion for research. I would look forward to our meetings each week,
since they enabled me to progress the project further, and never failed to be entertaining in
the way that we would always find something to joke around about. Thank you to Prof. Fiona
Barlow for welcoming me into her amusingly titled BLAB group while I have been working
with Dr. Thai. I am grateful for all the things I have learnt about social psychology and
academia while being involved. I wish to thank all those involved in the lab for their support
throughout the year. Thank you to Dr. Ans Vercammen, and the rest of the Green Research
Group (especially Charlie Pittaway for inviting me to present) for dedicating the entirety of
one of their lab meetings to listening to and providing useful feedback on my research
proposal presentation (and inviting me back to present the results). Thank you to Dr.
Christoph Klebl and Dr. Hema Preya Selvanathan from SIGN for providing feedback on my
research proposal at the Honours presentation event on 20 April 2023. Thank you to my
affectionately named Uni Ohana (a Hawaiian concept that entails forming close bonds with
those beyond one’s immediate biological relatives)—a close group of friends who have
supported each other on our journey through the Bachelor of Psychological Science at the
University of Queensland together—I’m not sure if I would have been able to get through the
degree without you. Thank you to Kari James, Dani Jentz, and James White for being
sources of enduring friendship and interesting discussions. Thank you to Jason Lyddieth for
going out of his way to train me in Greenpeace’s tactics and theory of change over a decade
ago when I was first forming a Greenpeace activist team in Brisbane, and for his continued
support and discussions about campaigning and social change to this day. Finally, thank you
to other friends and family who may not have been directly named here, but have still been
an important part of my life.

Abstract
Factions of the climate movement sometimes advocate for escalating their tactics, and
engage in disruptive mass civil disobedience in the effort to pressure governments to act on
anthropogenic climate change. However, this disruptive action can often affect the general
public, or other entities not directly responsible for the issue. Previous research on “the
activist's dilemma” has demonstrated that extreme protest actions can erode public support
for a movement (Feinberg et al., 2020). The present research proposes that this impact could
be intensified when the protest behaviour affects people who are deemed as undeserving.
Participants (N = 367) based in the United Kingdom (UK) were presented with a mock BBC
news article about a climate protest. The protest behaviour was manipulated to be either
moderate or extreme and the protest target was manipulated to be either deserving (i.e., a
fossil fuel corporation and its staff) or undeserving (i.e., a shopping centre and the general
public). Findings demonstrated that when the protest target was undeserving, participants
perceived the protest behaviour to be more immoral, felt less emotional connection and
social identification with the activists, and supported the movement less, compared to when
the protest target was deserving. The protest target also moderated the effect of protest
extremity, such that extreme protests were considered more immoral than moderate
protests, and this effect was amplified when the protest target was undeserving. These
findings suggest that climate protests which target the general public—or any entity
perceived as undeserving of being affected by a protest—will be perceived more negatively
and lead to lower support for the climate movement than protests which target those deemed
more directly responsible for the issue of climate change.
