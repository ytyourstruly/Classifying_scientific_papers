management systems, data analytics, and collaborative platforms, offers the transformative potential to improve
the efficiency, accuracy, and transparency of quality assurance practices.
Improving the efficiency, accuracy, and transparency of quality assurance practices is crucial for ensuring that
educational institutions meet the evolving demands of stakeholders while maintaining high standards of
accountability. Efficient quality assurance processes reduce the administrative burden on staff, freeing resources
and time that can be redirected toward core academic and developmental activities. By streamlining workflows,
institutions can more effectively monitor compliance with educational standards, respond to areas requiring
improvement, and implement corrective measures in a timely manner. Furthermore, accuracy in quality assurance
practices ensures that data-driven decisions are based on reliable and precise information. This minimizes the risk
of errors that could compromise the credibility of the institution or negatively impact stakeholders, including
students, faculty, and external accrediting bodies (Syukur et al., 2023).
Transparency, meanwhile, fosters trust and confidence among stakeholders by making quality assurance practices
visible and understandable. Transparent processes enable institutions to demonstrate their commitment to
excellence and accountability, providing clear evidence of how decisions are made and how educational standards
are upheld. For students, this translates into confidence that their learning environment meets rigorous quality
benchmarks. For faculty, it ensures a fair and equitable assessment of their contributions. For external stakeholders
such as employers and accrediting agencies, transparency underscores the institution’s reliability and integrity. In
sum, improving efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in quality assurance not only enhances institutional
credibility but also directly contributes to the overall quality of education and the equitable treatment of all
stakeholders (Psomas & Antony, 2017).
Meanwhile, the digitization of quality assurance processes represents a significant shift in how institutions ensure
and maintain educational quality standards. This transformation involves leveraging digital technologies to design,
implement, and monitor various aspects of quality assurance, such as curriculum development, teaching
methodologies, assessments, and student services (Dutta et al., 2021). Through digitization, institutions can collect
and analyze data more effectively, enabling data-driven and responsive decision-making. Digital quality assurance
systems allow for continuous monitoring of academic and administrative performance, facilitate the identification
of areas requiring improvement, and support the development of targeted enhancement strategies.
The Freedom to Learn-Independent Campus Curriculum, also known as Kurikulum Merdeka Belajar Kampus
Merdeka (MBKM), is causing a radical change in Indonesia's educational system. This curriculum emphasizes
flexibility, interdisciplinary learning, and real-world relevance, allowing students to tailor their educational
pathways according to their interests and career aspirations. The implementation of MBKM represents a bold
move toward fostering creativity, innovation, and lifelong learning skills, but it also introduces complexity in
ensuring consistent quality across diverse programs. This transformation necessitates the adoption of digital
technologies to design, implement, and monitor quality assurance processes that align with MBKM's objectives.
In curriculum development, digital technologies enable institutions to create and adapt programs that reflect
MBKM's core principles, such as cross-disciplinary learning and the integration of industry-relevant competencies.
Online platforms allow collaborative input from educators, industry experts, and policymakers, ensuring that the
curriculum remains dynamic and responsive to societal needs. Moreover, data analytics tools can assess the
effectiveness of curriculum changes by analyzing trends in student performance and feedback, which is crucial for
maintaining alignment with MBKM's goals (Amalia et al., 2018).
Teaching methodologies under MBKM emphasize experiential and project-based learning, where students gain
practical experience through internships, community projects, and entrepreneurial activities. Digital technologies
facilitate these methodologies by providing platforms for virtual internships, online project management tools, and
collaborative spaces for interdisciplinary learning (Perrin & Wang, 2021). Such tools support the flexibility and
student agency that MBKM champions while enabling institutions to track and evaluate the quality of these diverse
learning experiences.
Asian Institute of Research Education Quarterly Reviews Vol.7, No.4, 2024
Assessment practices within MBKM focus on competency-based evaluations that measure not only academic
knowledge but also practical skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities (Farida et al., 2019). Digital
assessment tools allow for more accurate, consistent, and scalable evaluations across different programs and
institutions. Real-time data collection and analysis also enable adaptive assessments that provide immediate
feedback to students, helping them identify areas for improvement and align their learning with their goals
(Chassin et al., 2010).
Student services are another critical component of quality assurance under MBKM. With the curriculum’s
emphasis on student independence and real-world engagement, institutions must provide robust support systems
to guide students through their educational journeys. Digital technologies enhance these services by streamlining
administrative processes, offering personalized academic advising, and providing platforms for tracking student
achievements in internships and other off-campus activities (Ryan, 2015).
By leveraging digital technologies in these areas, Indonesia can effectively implement and monitor the Kurikulum
MBKM, ensuring that its ambitious goals are met without compromising quality or equity. This integration of
technology into quality assurance processes not only supports the flexibility and innovation inherent in MBKM
but also addresses the challenges of managing a decentralized and diverse education system (Goericke, 2020). As
a result, digital transformation becomes a critical enabler in realizing MBKM’s vision of producing graduates who
are adaptive, skilled, and ready to contribute meaningfully to the global economy.
Furthermore, the implementation of digital technologies further extends the capacity of institutions to conduct
objective and transparent assessments. Advanced analytical tools and learning management systems provide real-
time metrics on performance indicators such as student engagement, learning progress, and teaching effectiveness.
These capabilities allow institutions to adapt their teaching approaches and curricula dynamically based on
feedback and outcomes. Moreover, digitization ensures consistency and standardization in assessment processes,
which is essential for maintaining academic integrity and equity for all learners (Elbadiansyah & Masyni, 2021).
Despite its potential, transitioning to fully digitized quality assurance systems presents several challenges (Lubis
& Daryanto, 2019). Institutions face the need for significant investment in technological infrastructure, alongside
comprehensive training for staff and faculty to ensure effective system utilization. Concerns regarding data
security and privacy add complexity, particularly in protecting sensitive student and staff information. On top of
that, achieving a balance between the efficiency of technology and the human-centric nature of education is crucial
to ensuring that digitalization supports rather than replaces the personal interactions that are central to teaching
and learning.
Building on these premises, this study focuses on the implementation of digitized quality assurance systems at the
Professional Education and Certification Institute (LPSP) of the State University of Surabaya. Specifically, the
research investigates the impact of digitization on the effectiveness of quality assurance processes, including
aspects such as assessment accuracy, process transparency, and student engagement. Additionally, the study
identifies the barriers and challenges faced by educational institutions in adopting digital technologies for quality
assurance, such as infrastructure limitations, staff training, and resistance to change (Elbadiansyah & Masyni,
2022).
By addressing these challenges, this research aims to provide actionable insights into best practices and strategies
for implementing digitization in quality assurance systems. The study contributes to the broader discourse on
integrating information technology with educational quality assurance, an area that remains underexplored despite
the increasing adoption of digital tools in education. This research is state of the art as it delves into the application
of specific digital tools—such as learning management systems and data analytics—in enhancing quality assurance
processes. The findings are expected to inform policymakers, education practitioners, and other stakeholders,
offering guidance for successfully navigating the social and ethical considerations of digitalization while ensuring

Asian Institute of Research Education Quarterly Reviews Vol.7, No.4, 2024
the system improved transparency by providing shared access to reports and dashboards, facilitating collaborative
decision-making across stakeholder groups (Bayne & Jandrić, 2017).
These findings reflect broader trends in the adoption of digital technologies for quality assurance. However, the
study identified areas where transparency could be further improved, particularly for students, who reported
limited access to certain features due to mobile compatibility issues (Memarian & Doleck, 2023). Addressing these
concerns through enhanced system design could further align the system with principles of inclusivity and equity
(Ramírez & Tejada, 2018).
The study highlighted several challenges during the implementation of digitization. Infrastructure limitations, such
as inadequate internet bandwidth and outdated hardware, hindered the system's seamless adoption, particularly in
remote or off-campus settings. Data privacy concerns also emerged as a critical issue, with leaders emphasizing
the need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive information.
Another unexpected finding was the tension between automation and personalization. While automated processes
improved efficiency, some faculty members expressed concerns about reduced opportunities for nuanced, context-
sensitive decision-making. This underscores the importance of balancing technological efficiency with human
oversight to maintain the integrity of educational processes.
User satisfaction with the digital system was generally high, with an average score of 4.7 out of 5. Leaders and
staff reported significant benefits in terms of usability and time savings, while students appreciated increased
access to resources and feedback mechanisms. However, a minority of users—particularly students—reported
challenges related to system navigation and accessibility. These findings suggest that while the system meets the
needs of most users, targeted improvements are necessary to ensure inclusivity and engagement for all stakeholder
groups.
The findings have important theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, they contribute to the growing
body of literature on digital transformation in higher education by providing evidence of its impact on quality
assurance processes. The study reinforces theories of organizational change, highlighting the need for capacity-
building and stakeholder engagement to ensure the successful adoption of digital systems.
Practically, the study offers actionable insights for institutions seeking to digitize their quality assurance processes.
Recommendations such as infrastructure upgrades, enhanced training programs, and mobile-friendly design can
