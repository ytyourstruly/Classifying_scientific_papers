Abstract
We report a new, unexpected effect in which the visual system responds binocularly to text
becoming harder to read because of reduced contrast. Participants read a row of white numbers
against a static background that changed from black to white, from left to right. There was
pervasive binocular disparity between the fixation points of the left and right eye. The lines of
sight typically crossed in front of the stimulus plane. The proportion of such disparities
increased systematically, as did their size, as reading difficulty increased. We explain this novel
effect in terms of the projection of the visual hemifields to the cortex. First, the central part of
the binocular perceptual window benefits from contralateral hemispheric projection for both
eyes. Second, the larger this central zone, the more high quality context is available against
which to compare the digit currently being read. Third, placing the stimulus beyond the
horopter reduces the probability of one eye’s input being suppressed. Thus, we see that
binocularity in human vision is remarkably flexible. Optimal perception for higher cognitive
processing is ensured by strategies embodied in the peripheral musculature, cashed out
neuropsychologically: apparent failures to fixate conjointly help us to read in difficult
conditions.

Adapting to low contrast;
how the remarkable flexibility of binocular fixation helps us read better
Research into how we read is an interdisciplinary crossroads. Vision scientists,
psychologists and cognitive neuropsychologists all contribute to the understanding of the
relation between eye movements, retinal stimulation and visual word recognition. Below, we
present new experimental data on the reading of text in conditions of reduced contrast.
Specifically, we report how reducing the range of black and white values affects vergence
and the relation between the fixation points of the two eyes. We interpret the data in terms of
theorising that brings together vision science, psychological and neuropsychological
considerations. This theorising converges on the role of hemisphericity and the bilaterally
symmetrical body-plan. We consider the three research literatures in turn.
Vision science
We typically see a single image when the two eyes fixate. This image results either
from binocular fusion or from one or other retinal image being suppressed. In some
circumstances we see a double image (diplopia). Historically, researchers have assumed, by
default, that optimal binocular vision occurs when the two lines of sight (visual axes)
precisely intersect on the relevant plane, facilitating summation of the two retinal images.
When the two visual axes do not intersect at exactly the same point on the relevant plane,
there is a fixation disparity (FD), the distance between the fixation points of the two eyes
during a single fixation. Either the axes cross in front of the plane (an eso or crossed FD) or
behind the plane (an exo or uncrossed FD). In both cases, fusion, suppression or diplopia
must occur. The default assumption has been that larger FDs are more problematic for fusion,
so that vergence movements during a ‘static’ fixation typically reduce the FD. Panum’s
fusional area is defined as the area on one retina in which a point will fuse with a single point
on the other retina. Within this general framework (cf. Howard, 2012), researchers have
explored each assumption and its associated parameters (e.g. Fender & Julesz, 1967; Schor &
Tyler, 1981).
Reading from a 2D plane is simpler than viewing the 3D world. We do not see depth
differences within the text; there is no disparity gradient between nearby elements in the
scene (cf. Burt & Julesz, 1980). The problem is to fuse the two images of the text, offset by
the size of the FD.
The visual system continuously adapts to luminance, colour, motion and contrast
(e.g., Ghosh et al., 2017; Schaeffel, 2017). It changes its sensitivity according to whether
contrast is high or low (Blakemore & Campbell, 1969; Baccus & Meister, 2004). Researchers
have studied the sensitivity and behaviour of human and non-human visual functions, and in
response to contrast in reading and non-reading tasks (e.g. Buchner & Baumgartner, 2007;
Buchner et al., 2009; Fujita et al., 2008; Glaholt et al., 2014; Legge et al., 1997; Legge et al.,
1987; Nasanen et al., 2001; Macé et al., 2005; Reingold & Rayner, 2006; Jarsky et al., 2011).
Abbonizio et al. (2002) and Johansson et al. (2014) have reported a significant enhancement
effect under binocular conditions at low levels of contrast. Meese et al. (2006) accurately
model high levels of binocular summation at different levels of luminance contrast. Baccus
and Meister (2004) suggest that contrast adaptation could be a cumulative effect modulated
by previous processing.
Many of the studies, above, suggest that binocular viewing is intimately tied up with
the response to local contrast. According to Jainta et al. (2017), binocular processing
behaviours generally relate to binocular summation, where more robust visual information is
received from the combined signals of the two eyes ’receptors, facilitating detection and
discrimination of visual stimuli (cf. Blake et al., 1981; Blake & Wilson, 2011). During this
process, visual information such as luminance and contrast are assumed to be extracted in
early visual processing.
Subjectively, contrast resembles blur; both are relatively lacking in high spatial
frequency information (Watson et al.,1986). Blur means an image being visibly not in focus,
contrast means the range of black and white values in the image. The sensitivity of spatial
vision in conditions of visual noise continues to attract the attention of researchers (e.g.
Morgan, 2017; Schmittwilken et al., 2024; Solomon & Morgan, 2020). Hence, studies of blur
are potentially relevant to the study of visual contrast we present below.
Jainta et al. (2011) report an eye-tracking study involving the reading of black text on
a white background. The text was either sharp or blurred. Their 0.5-D blurred stimulus was
still readable but appeared considerably out of focus. In the non-blurred condition, they found
an average eso (crossed) FD, with mean minimum fixation disparity of 16 ±21 min arc and
therefore slightly smaller than the average character width (20 min arc) (cf. Nuthmann &
Kliegl, 2009; Jainta et al., 2010). They found that vergence angle decreased in all participants
by a few minutes of arc, from 364 ±31 min arc to 357 ±32 min arc on average. This small,
but significant movement was in an exo (uncrossed) direction, meaning that their eyes
diverged (cf. Jaschinski-Kruza, 1994). They concluded that blurring caused the vergence
position to shift toward a participant’s individual resting position.
The disparity limits corresponding to Panum’s fusional area for fine-line targets are
±7 min arc for central (foveal) vision, but they are larger for peripheral vision (Bishop, 1975)
and for random-dot stereograms (Fender & Julesz, 1967). Kulikowski (1978) shows that
Panum’s area also increases for stimuli with blurred contours.
Thus, we might predict that our experiment with reading low-contrast text will show
FDs moving in an exo (uncrossed) direction, in line with Jainta et al.’s (2011) carefully
controlled study. However, note that a movement in an exo direction falls short of a
qualitative change from a crossed (right eye to the left of the left eye) to an uncrossed (right
eye to the right of the left eye) binocular fixation.
Psychology
Psychologists have been concerned with the fact that the fixation points of the two
eyes are frequently not conjoint, not necessarily falling on the same point in a visual scene
(e.g. Cornell et al., 2003; Enright, 1998) or on the same letter during reading (e.g. Hendriks,
1996; Liversedge et al., 2006). Fixation disparity has been conventionally seen as error, with
precisely conjoint fixations being at least the optimal goal of eye movements.
Eye-movement researchers have shown that reducing contrast causes readers to make
more fixations and longer fixations (Legge et al., 1990) and shrinks their visual span (Legge
et al., 1997). Johansson et al. (2014) reported changing performance in reading speed and
fixation duration according to the level of contrast. They concluded that the efficiency of
binocular processing is influenced by the degree of contrast.
Variation in text-background contrast elicits change in binocular performance in both
reading (Legge et al., 1990; Johansson et al., 2014) and non-reading (Kirkby et al., 2010;
Liversedge et al., 2006) tasks. Kirkby et al. (2010) have reported similar absolute magnitudes
of fixation disparity in scanning non-linguistic stimuli and in reading text (Liversedge et al.,
2006), despite differences of experimental settings such as font size or viewing distance. This
result is consistent with the previous literature exploring the task-specific modulation of
binocular behaviours (Bucci & Kapoula, 2006; Blythe et al., 2006; Roufs & Boschman,
1997). Similar binocular modulation has also been reported in digit reading in response to
contrast reduction, showing increased fixation duration and saccade amplitudes and
decreased visual span (Näsänen et al., 2001).
There has been a longstanding issue concerning the direction of fixation disparities, as
particularly observed in the eye-tracking of reading: Dual-Purkinje eye-tracking has typically
resulted in the lines of sight tending to cross behind the stimulus plane (e.g. Kirkby et al.,
2010; Liversedge et al., 2006), whereas video-based technologies have tended to show the
lines of sight crossing in front of the stimulus plane (e.g. Nuthmann & Kliegl, 2009, Shillcock
et al., 2010). Kirkby et al. (2013) present data that offers a resolution to this issue. They used
similar stimuli (i.e. light stimuli on a dark background) with the two technologies and found a
majority of uncrossed fixations for unaligned fixations. They suggest that variables such as
luminance and viewing distance are responsible for observed differences in the direction of
FDs.
In summary, researchers in Vision Science and in Psychology have found rather small
FDs in reading. When the stimuli have been white letters on a black background (as is
required in Dual Purkinje technology) the majority of CDs have been uncrossed (exo). When
stimuli are degraded, FDs tend to move in an exo direction.
Cognitive neuropsychology
Vision scientists have produced sophisticated mathematical models of spatial vision,
in conjunction with carefully controlled experiments, taking individual differences between
participants into account. Psychologists have likewise generated comprehensive implemented
models of eye movements in reading, accounting for a large range of experimental findings.
Both of these research endeavours have been somewhat less oriented to cognitive
neuropsychological explanation, except when impairment and suboptimal normal processing
have been concerned. Below, we will present new data concerning reading and visual
contrast and we will introduce three factors—(a) foveal splitting, (b) the contralateral
advantage, and (c) the processing of retinal disparities—to draw together the relevant data
and theorising from Vision Science and Psychology in a more cognitive neuropsychological
direction.
We created a novel task—recognising successive random numbers in a single string—
to study the binocular fixation behaviours in reading, guaranteeing minimal support from
adjacent context. Critically, the one-line stimulus ranged from maximal legibility (white
numbers on a black background) to complete illegibility (white numbers on a white
background). The goal was to sample binocular fixation behaviours across the complete
range of visual contrast.
We tested the hypothesis that participants’ fixation disparities would respond
systematically to contrast variation during reading.
Materials and methods
Participants
We paid 38 males whose first language was read from left to right to participate. We
tested only males to eliminate any sex-based differences in lateralisation, given the role of
hemisphericity in our theorising; we make no claims concerning generalisability to females.
All reported having normal or corrected-to-normal vision and gave informed consent to
participate. Ethical approval was given by the Psychology Research Ethics Committee
(reference 436-1819/7, March 2020).
Apparatus
Participants sat in a room with diffused lighting, and watched a 22'' Samsung
SyncMaster 2233 display, at a distance of 74 cm. Screen resolution was 1680 x 1050 pixels at
60Hz. A chin-rest and forehead-support kept the head stable. The eye-tracker was an SR
Research EyeLink 1000 video-based tracker.
Stimulus materials and procedure
Each stimulus display had 54 white random numbers (font size 14) across the middle
of the screen. The background gradually faded from pure black to pure white, from left to
right, created with Photoshop’s fading function, making the numbers increasingly difficult to
Information) shows the spatial layout of the stimulus materials.
Eye movements were recorded binocularly in desktop mode with pupil and corneal
reflection and sampled at 550Hz. Participants were calibrated monocularly with a 9-point
fixation grid while occluding the other eye with a black paper shade before each block of the
experiment. The calibration background was the average perceived colour of the task stimuli.
The experiment was designed in Experiment Builder (developed by SR-Forum) and lasted for
approximately 15 mins.
After a successful calibration (average calibration error less that .5), participants
followed instructions on the screen and pressed a key to continue the task at their own pace.
They read out loud the line of numbers as accurately as possible and pressed a key for the
next stimulus when they could recognise no more numbers.
Analysis
the digits. We first produced demonstrative graphs to show the distributions of the binocular
eye movement behaviours. We then analysed the data quantitatively with GLMER and
LMER models, to further characterise the eye-movement behaviours. We used Linear Mixed-
Effects Regression Models (LMER) and General Linear Mixed-Effects Regression Models
(GLMER), carried out in R using the lme4 software package (Bates et al., 2008). In the
GLMER modelling, we used counts of binocular fixations as dependent variables in the
models. We defined null models with participants and trials as random factors. Predictor
variables include the type of fixation disparity (e.g. C-C—“crossed”, i.e. lines of sight
crossing in front of the stimulus plane, at beginning and end of fixation; U-U—“uncrossed”,
i.e. lines of sight crossing virtually behind the stimulus plane, at beginning and end of
fixation) and the horizontal extent of the screen divided into three equal parts (A1, A2, A3—
with reading difficulty A1<A2<A3; A2 was not included in the modelling to show the
interaction results more clearly). (N.B. This “crossed/uncrossed” terminology should not be
confused with the optometric definition of crossed/uncrossed retinal disparities.) In the
LMER modelling, we used the size of fixation disparity at the end of fixation as the
dependent variable in the models for crossed and uncrossed fixations respectively. We
defined null models with participants and trials as random factors. Predictor variables
included the horizontal extent (A1, A2, A3) of the trial. Model fit was assessed using the
anova function to compare models.
Results
We analysed a total of 54,456 binocular fixations. We report the results from two
perspectives, with distribution of qualitative disparity and quantitative disparity: (a) Type of
fixation disparity (i.e. crossed or uncrossed at start and end of fixation: C-C, U-U, C-U, U-
C).(b) Size of disparity at fixation end (crossed vs. uncrossed, respectively). The results
indicate systematic and adaptive binocular behaviours in prompt, continuous interaction with
changes in the stimulus.
Disparity type at the beginning and end of fixation
beginning and end of fixation. Wholly crossed fixations (C-C) and wholly uncrossed
fixations (U-U) predominate. C-C fixations increase from A1 to A3, U-U fixations decrease.
Statistical models with the easiest and hardest areas to read (A1, A3) and types (C-C, U-U)
significantly more C-C values in A3 compared with A1, indicating the increasing number of
wholly crossed fixations.
Disparity size at end of fixation in crossed and uncrossed fixations
derived from the statistical models (as shown in Tables 3–6). These estimates represent the
model’s prediction of the average disparity values for crossed and uncrossed fixations.
Negative values indicate crossed fixations (i.e. lines of sight crossing in front of the stimulus
plane, right eye’s fixation to the left of the left eye’s), positive values indicate uncrossed
fixations (i.e. lines of sight crossing behind the stimulus plane, right eye’s fixation to the right
of the left eye’s).
fixations, particularly between A2 and A3, suggesting that participants produced more
towards smaller positive values from A1 to A3 for uncrossed fixations, particularly between
A1 and A2, reflecting a decrease in uncrossed fixations as participants read from left to right.
These trends are statistically confirmed by the model outputs presented in Tables 3 and 5
(together with model comparison in Tables 4 and 6).
reduce in absolute size first and the crossed disparities then tend to increase in absolute size.
Mean pupil size
The mean pupil size of the two eyes decreased gradually from A1 to A3. Statistical
modelling indicated significantly smaller right eye pupil size in A3 (Est= -129.424, SE=
1.844, t(44197)= -70.18, p< .001) and greater value in A1 (Est= 86.693, SE= 1.786,
t(44197)= 48.53, p< .001) compared with A2. A similar result can be seen in the left eye with
greater mean pupil size in A1 (Est= 166.86, SE= 2.024, t(44197)= 82.42, p< .001) and
smaller pupil size in A3 (Est= -186.527, SE= 2.09, t(44197)= -87.34, p< .001).
Discussion
Overall, participants produced both crossed and uncrossed binocular fixations, the
former always predominating, in room conditions of diffused lighting. As text-background
contrast on the screen gradually decreased across the single-line stimulus, making reading
more difficult, two things happened. The proportion of uncrossed fixations and the size of the
accompanying fixation disparities decreased. The proportion of crossed fixations and the size
of the accompanying fixation disparities increased. We hypothesised that fixation disparity
would respond systematically to contrast variation during reading, but the existing research
literature suggested fixation disparities would constitute only small departures from conjoint
fixation and that degraded stimuli, similar to those used by Jainta et al. (2011), would
encourage a movement in the exo direction. The increasing size and the eso direction of the
FDs we report are surprising.
Eye fixations and the visual pathways
Three key findings about fixations and the visual pathways are central to our interpretation of
the results.
Foveal splitting
Each eye’s fovea is vertically divided in projecting to the hemispheres and the
subcortical structures. The precision of this splitting has been explored for decades: see Ellis
and Brysbaert (2010) for a review; see Obregón and Shillcock (2012) for the relevance to
reading; see Gibaldi et al. (2021) for the hemispheric projection of the two complete
hemifields. Each hemifovea projects contralaterally to its respective hemisphere. In the left
eye, the nasal hemifovea projects to the right hemisphere and the temporal hemifovea to the
left hemisphere, and conversely in the right eye.
Researchers have asked whether a central vertical strip in the human fovea projects
directly to both hemispheres—a nasotemporal overlap; such bilateral projection exists in cats,
rodents and non-human primates. However, there have been methodological obstacles to
answering this question for the human visual system. For current purposes, we will observe
that in humans any bilateral foveal projection is less substantial than in non-humans. The
effective processing from what Fendrich et al. (1996, p. 643) call “at best a weak
representation of the contralateral hemiretina” may, they note, require a stimulus presentation
longer than 200 msec (i.e. the length of a whole typical fixation in reading); Gibaldi et al.
(2021) also use this relatively long stimulus presentation in their exploration of bilateral
projection.
Consider a precisely conjoint fixation on the centre of a 2D object. In a perfect
vertical splitting of the fovea, both eyes contralaterally project the left half of the object to the
right hemisphere and the right half of the object to the left hemisphere. A nasotemporal
overlap from the same exactly conjoint fixation means that more of the object overall is
projected to each hemisphere—a version of hemispheric communication, ‘stitching together ’
the visual stimulus into a continuous whole. On the one hand, two separate but virtually
identical visual inputs are more reliable than a single input (Jones & Lee, 1981). On the other
hand, duplication is inefficient. Such duplication may be accommodated by the fact that a
large proportion of the non-human mammalian brain is dedicated to visual processing.
Further, such hemispheric communication—a hard-wired nasotemporal overlap—may be
adaptive and sufficient for the limited behavioural repertoires of non-humans: cats require to
respond rapidly to fast-moving targets very close to their eyes; arboreal primates rely on
rapid grasping in climbing.
In contrast, humans have a richer behavioural repertoire involving vision. They are
superior at integrating non-local aspects of the visual scene (Matsuno & Fujita, 2009),
indicating that human higher-order cognitive processing combines the visual hemifields to
more advantage than a hard-wired nasotemporal overlap. Higher cognitive processing reflects
the human brain’s uniquely florid hemispheric specialisation. In any case, closely controlled
non-conjoint fixations with vertically divided foveas still afford the human visual system
flexible access to any advantages of nasotemporal overlap.
Gibaldi et al. (2021) argue that a naso-temporal overlap is adaptive for calculating
depth in natural scenes: an absence of naso-temporal overlap would mean that entities in the
sectors immediately in front of and behind a conjoint fixation point are only projected to one
hemisphere (their Fig. 1, p. 2), requiring hemispheric communication in order to calculate the
disparity between the two eyes’ views. We take the view, here, that foveal nasotemporal
overlap has diminished to a minimal degree over human evolution, but leaving an adaptive
non-foveal overlap, as argued for by Gibaldi et al..
Contralateral advantage
The contralateral projection from retina to cortical hemisphere is advantaged over the
ipsilateral projection from retina to cortical hemisphere, for each eye (see Obregón &
Shillcock, 2012, and Toosy et al., 2001, for the mechanisms responsible for this effect). That
is, the left eye projects more strongly to the right hemisphere, and the right eye to the left
hemisphere.
Retinal disparities
Different systems are responsible for fusing binocular images from the zone between
the viewer and the horopter and for fusing binocular images from the zone beyond the
horopter. (The horopter is a theoretical curved surface; any point on the horopter projects to
corresponding points on the two retinas; see, e.g., Hillis & Banks, 2001. For a review of
optical and psychological approaches to the horopter, see Turski, 2023). Different systems
are necessary because of the directionality of the depth relations within the two zones, when
viewed binocularly—crossed versus uncrossed retinal disparities (N.B. as opposed to fixation
disparities). Binocular fusion for entities between the viewer and the horopter develops two
weeks earlier in infancy (Braddick, 1996). Binocular suppression/fusion in this region is
necessarily more robust and necessarily involves a degree of dominance of one eye’s input
over the other because of the greater viewpoint difference between the two eyes.
Hemisphericity and the bilaterally symmetrical body-plan
How are our data to be interpreted in the light of the above position regarding
fixations and the visual pathways?
Region A1 contained the largest proportion of uncrossed fixation disparities, although
still fewer than for crossed fixation disparities. This prominence for uncrossed disparities is
consistent with previous studies of binocular reading with dark backgrounds (Kirkby et al.,
2010, 2013; Liversedge et al., 2006). These studies employed Dual-Purkinje eye-tracking,
which requires complete darkness, meaning minimal visual context to support correctly
fusing (i.e. ‘overlaying’) the very clear, high contrast inputs from each eye. This technology
typically produces uncrossed fixations in reading. High contrast binocular input with minimal
context is unusual. The visual system finesses the problem of fusing such input by diverging
and creating an uncrossed fixation. This action ‘moves’ the stimulus images to inside the
horopter. Images from within the horopter can be robustly processed by suppressing one
eye’s input and allowing the other to dominate (see above). The high contrast allows the
viewer to depend on monocular input with minimal loss of information.
The larger proportion of uncrossed fixations in A1 is driven by the illumination level in
a relatively small area around fixation, compared with the rest of the screen and experimental
setting. This novel finding extends the observations made using Dual-Purkinje technology.
The reduction of mean pupil size across the line of the stimulus shows the effect of the
luminance level specific to the region around fixation as opposed to the overall luminance of
the whole experimental setting.
As participants moved from A1 into A2, reading became more difficult and they
fewer uncrossed fixations here because the local area of the screen becomes lighter and closer
to normal room lighting conditions. Participants also produced more crossed fixations, with
for these more typical viewing conditions because the central part of the foveal window
(between the two fixation points) consists of the overlap of the two best retina-to-cortex
Note that a precisely conjoint fixation combines one privileged and one non-privileged
projection on either side.
Why should a relatively large fixation disparity be adaptive in these more typical
reading conditions? It benefits reading because it extends the overall perceptual window—a
wider extent of the line is in view. Our task excluded the lexical, syntactic and semantic
contexts typical of reading normal text, but some residual context effects, such as comparing
digits at different points in the line, invariably remain. A larger fixation disparity, meaning a
larger perceptual window, can take advantage of such context effects.
As participants moved into A3, local luminance continued to increase, contrast
The trends in disparity across different areas of the stimulus suggest a systematic
convergence in uncrossed and crossed fixations. Initially, as contrast decreases, there is a
clear shrinkage in the size of the uncrossed disparities due to the reduction in larger
uncrossed fixations. Simultaneously, the size of the crossed disparities increases relatively
little (but still significantly) until it eventually increases substantially, indicating that the
smaller crossed fixations are expanding. Overall, as contrast reduces, there is a
complementary pattern in which the disparity range narrows for uncrossed fixations while
Thus, Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate a timescale in which larger uncrossed disparities
shrink and smaller crossed disparities then expand. This sequence is compatible with
convergence occurring most effectively by means of the medial rectus muscle of both eyes
pulling the eyes inwards from a directly sagittal (forward looking) orientation while the
lateral rectus muscles simultaneously relax; this behaviour is less readily accomplished for
more extreme degrees of convergence. This embodied process gives priority to converting
uncrossed disparities to crossed, increasing the chances of using the input to both eyes rather
than risking having one eye’s input suppressed (see above). (Note that in the real world of a
3D object very close to the viewer the two eyes would be seeing substantially different views
of the object and suppression of one or other image would be appropriate. In the 2D world of
reading the two views remain reconcilable by simple fusion. Note, also, that ocular
prevalence further complicates the situation; fusion may occur between two eyes of equal
capacities, but with one eye temporarily contributing more to conscious perception. See Zhu
et al., 2021, 2024).
Conclusions
The hypothesis we explored—that participants’ fixation disparities would respond
systematically to contrast variation—was borne out in terms of a surprising new effect.
Overall, participants behaved lawfully in their binocular fixations as contrast decreased: they
converged, producing fewer and smaller uncrossed fixation disparities, together with more
crossed fixations, with larger fixation disparities. We might have conventionally predicted
that increasingly poor visual information would cause the two eyes to focus conjointly on the
very same point to read a particular unclear digit, thereby doubling the resources applied.
Alternatively, we might have expected behaviour resembling that found with blur—fixation
disparity moving in the uncrossed (exo) direction. However, we found that the largest
binocular disparities occurred when the information was poorest (i.e. lowest contrast) and
that fixation disparities moved in a very substantial crossed (eso) direction. We have analysed
and interpreted this counterintuitive result by drawing together vision science and
psychological research in terms of the cognitive neuropsychology of the bilaterally
symmetrical body-plan and the resulting hemisphericity. The resulting picture is one of very
flexible vergence behaviour that optimises reading perception in varying visual conditions.
