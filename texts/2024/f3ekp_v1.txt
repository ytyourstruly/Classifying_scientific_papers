Abstract
A long-standing debate in the psychology of learning and memory is whether contingency
awareness – explicit recognition of the relationship between conditioned stimuli (CS) and
unconditioned stimuli (US) – is a prerequisite for fear acquisition in humans. In an extensive
participant pool (N=895), we systematically investigated the impact of manipulating core
experimental parameters and individual differences that may moderate contingency
awareness. Key parameters included presence of online expectancy or fear ratings,
engagement in concurrent tasks, sensory modalities of CS and US, and type of instruction.
These manipulations strongly influenced the proportion of participants who acquired
contingency awareness, ranging between 47% and 96%, with only aware participants
exhibited conditioned responses. We confirm that contingency awareness is necessary for
human fear conditioning, and highlight the parameters that experimenters can use to ensure
learning. Individual differences in age, personality traits, and working memory capacity did not
contribute to the probability of becoming contingency aware.

Introduction
Identification of threats and organization of appropriate responses to reduce or avoid harm is
critical for survival. The mechanism subserving this function is fear conditioning(Lonsdorf et
al., 2017), a form of associative learning. In this process, an initially neutral stimulus, e.g., the
ringing of a bell (conditioned stimulus, CS+), is repeatedly paired with an aversive stimulus
(unconditioned stimulus, US) such as a loud noise, while another neutral stimulus, e.g., a
whistle (CS-) is never paired with the US. After several pairings, CS+ begins to trigger the
conditioned response, which entails a subjective, physiological and/or behavioral reaction that
is preparatory for the onset of the US. One of the central debates in fear conditioning revolves
around contingency awareness, which refers to the ability to consciously recognize the
association between CS and US (Lovibond & Shanks, 2002). Although some studies suggest
that fear conditioning can occur without contingency awareness (Knight et al., 2003; Jovanovic
et al., 2006; Raio et al., 2012; Schultz & Helmstetter, 2010; Steinberg et al., 2012), a meta-
analysis including thirty original studies found no convincing evidence to support this claim
(Mertens & Engelhard, 2020). Clarifying the relationship between awareness and fear
conditioning is crucial for understanding the conditions under which individuals learn to fear
new stimuli, and can help to understand the aetiology and treatment of fear-related disorders.
Depending on the experimental design, ~15-30% of participants will never acquire awareness
(Berg et al., 2022; Mertens & Engelhard, 2020). Why do people fail in such seemingly simple
tasks? Being able to focus all attention on the task seems to be an important factor - some
studies have successfully prevented participants from gaining awareness by using distracting
simultaneous tasks during conditioning (Clark & Squire, 1998; Dawson et al., 1986; Manns et
al., 2001; Weidemann et al., 2016). Variations in instructions (fully or partially informing
participants about the contingencies vs. not informing them) have also been shown to
significantly impact awareness levels (Dawson & Biferno, 1973; Mertens et al., 2021).
However, many potentially relevant procedural parameters have never been systematically
investigated. For example, it is plausible that trace conditioning that includes some lag
between CS and US would decrease the proportion of contingency aware participants as
compared with delay conditioning where the CS and US are overlapped in time or follow each
other with no break. However, no studies have explored this possibility. Other theoretically
possible but never studied factors are the rate of reinforcement, the nature of the US (e.g.,
loud noise or aversive pictures), and modality of the CS.
Additionally, inter-individual differences in personality traits and cognitive abilities may
modulate the probability of becoming aware of contingencies. The effect of elevated trait
anxiety - a commonly studied variable affecting acquisition of fear - was shown to increase
(Rehbein et al., 2015), decrease (Chan & Lovibond, 1996), or not affect (Berg et al., 2022;
Sevenster et al., 2014) contingency awareness. Central cognitive abilities such as working
memory capacity are likely also relevant for contingency awareness, such as for supporting
the ability to maintain the CS in memory if the trace conditioning procedure is involved. The
relationship of contingency awareness and working memory was tested and found to be
positive in a small group of participants (Cosand et al., 2008). Another contributing concept
related to cognitive control is mind wandering, which refers to the diversion of attention from
the current task and situation (Schooler et al., 2011). We hypothesise that there is a negative
correlation between proneness to mind wandering and awareness acquisition. Overall,
exploring the modulating effects of inter-individual differences on awareness acquisition is
essential to understanding the phenomenon.
The primary limitation of studying contingency awareness in a laboratory setting is the inherent
imbalance in participant groups, where, in a typical scenario, about 85% become aware, and
15% do not. Therefore, many previous studies on fear conditioning in relation to contingency
awareness suffer from limited statistical power to detect small and medium size effects. This
limitation can be mitigated by conducting studies online. The emergence of recruiting platforms
such as Prolific and Javascript-based experimental platforms such as Pavlovia have rapidly
expanded the recruitment of large and diverse global populations, which can enhance
statistical power and also increase the external validity of studies. Recently, several
researchers have begun to conduct online fear conditioning studies demonstrating the
feasibility of such an approach (Björkstrand et al., 2022; Lambert et al., 2021; Plog et al., 2023;
Purves et al., 2023; Stegmann et al., 2021).
Here, in a large online sample we systematically investigated and directly compared the
impact of manipulating common experimental parameters and individual differences on
contingency awareness, aiming to understand the relationship between learning in the
classical conditioning paradigm and awareness. This will inform the debate on the role of
awareness in fear conditioning and also inform future studies in the selection of optimal
procedural parameters.
First, in twelve separate groups of participants, we tested whether parameters such as CS-
US proximity (i.e., delay vs trace conditioning), the level of US aversiveness, reinforcement
rate, and other parameters (the experimental parameters and hypotheses are summarised in
Fig. 1a and a full numbered list of preregistered hypotheses is presented in Appendix) were
able to modulate contingency awareness rates. Second, we compared indicators of learning
(as expressed in affective ratings of CS) between aware and unaware individuals to test
whether fear learning without awareness is possible. We hypothesized that participants who
are contingency-unaware would not exhibit fear learning, as expressed in no CS+/CS-
difference in the affective ratings.
To test whether individual differences in personality traits affect the probability of becoming
contingency-aware, we measured several traits previously associated with fear conditioning:
trait anxiety, state anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, the behavioural inhibition system (BIS)
and the behavioural activation system (BAS) (Lonsdorf et al., 2017; Lonsdorf & Merz, 2017;
Morriss et al., 2019). Furthermore, we measured working memory (WM) capacity to
understand how the ability to maintain information over short periods of time is related to the
ability to make associations between events. We also used WM as a measure of general
cognitive ability, given its association with various cognitive abilities such as fluid intelligence
(Unsworth et al., 2014), language comprehension (Daneman & Merikle, 1996), and
mathematical reasoning (Raghubar et al., 2010). We expected a positive correlation between
WM capacity and awareness attainment. We also examined susceptibility to mind wandering
as an indicator of attention control, hypothesizing a negative correlation with awareness
acquisition. Lastly, we predicted a negative association between age and the acquisition of
contingency awareness.
Fig. 1. (a) Experimental parameters and hypotheses. "Habituation" group had a habituation
phase before the fear acquisition phase during which no US were presented (identical to the
extinction phase). In the groups "Unspecific instruction" and "'Specific instruction", the CS-US
contingency was partially and fully informed, respectively. For the "'Overlap CS-US" group,
the "Sound US" group serves as the reference group. Both the 'Unspecific instruction' and
"Specific instruction" groups use the "Fear ratings" group as their reference. Also, it was
expected that "Specific instruction" will show a higher awareness rate than "Unspecific
instruction" group. For all other groups, the "Reference" group was used for comparison. (b)

The median participation time for the study was 43.54 minutes, with each participant receiving
£6 as compensation. A total of 1048 individuals participated in the study (mean age = 32.90
years, age range = 18-60 years; 414 females, 634 males). In full compliance with the
preregistration, we excluded 153 participants (14.6%) for low attention levels (refer to
'Attention checks' below), leaving 895 participants (85.4%, mean age = 33.30 years, age
range = 18-60 years; 356 females, 539 males) for statistical analyses. All 895 participants
This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of
Tübingen.
Procedure
Participants initially filled out a demographics questionnaire, followed by the personality
questionnaires. Subsequently, they engaged in the working memory task, and finally,
participated in the conditioning experiment.
Questionnaires
Information about sex, age, educational background, native language, drug use (including
smoking, alcohol, coffee, and any other substances consumed within the past two hours),
socioeconomic status, and handedness was collected from the participants. To assess
personality traits, the 27-item Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS) (Freeston et al., 1994),
the 20-item BIS/BAS scales (Carver & White, 1994), and the 40-item State-Trait Anxiety
Inventory (STAI) (Spielberger et al., 1983) were administered.
Working memory task
All participants completed 100 trials of a change localization task, an experimental paradigm
used to assess visual working memory capacity (Zhao et al., 2023). In each trial, participants
were shown a sample array of six colored squares (0.4 pixels × 0.4 pixels) for 400
milliseconds. After a 1000-millisecond blank screen, they were presented with a test array
identical to the sample array, except that one square changed to a color not previously
presented. The colors were selected randomly without replacement from a set of nine, with
the following red, green, and blue values: [[1, -1, -1], [-1, 1, -1], [-1, -1, 1], [1, 1, -1], [-1, 1, 1],
[1, -1, 1], [1, 0.2941, -1], [-1, -1, -1], [1, 1, 1]]. Participants had to identify and click on the
square in the test array that had changed its color. The test array remained visible until a
response was made. Trials were separated by a 1000-millisecond inter-trial interval (see Fig.
A1 for a visual depiction). The percentage of correct answers served as an indicator of working
memory capacity.
Throughout the experiment, participants were pseudorandomly asked every 13-18 trials, for a
total of six times, to describe their current conscious experience using six response options:
1) I was completely focused on the current task; 2) I was thinking about my performance on
the task; 3) I was distracted by sights, sounds, or physical sensations; 4) I was intentionally
thinking about things unrelated to the task; 5) I was unintentionally thinking about things
unrelated to the task; and 6) My mind was blank. The responses where participants selected
options 3 to 6 indicated a mind-wandering episode. The total number of episodes was used in
the statistical analyses.
Sound calibration
In Group 7 (Story), to address variations in system volume among participants, we
implemented the following calibration procedure. This procedure has been shown to be
feasible and effective in a previous study (Berg et al., 2023). A 1-second 1200 Hz sound
served as the test stimulus. Participants were exposed to this sound at two different volume
levels before commencing the conditioning paradigm. Given that the decibel scale measures
sound volume relatively, we used Audacity 3.3.2 (Audacity Team, 2023) to create two identical
sounds except for a consistent 60 dB difference in loudness between them. The 60-dB
difference remained constant regardless of the actual volume at which the sounds were
played. During the calibration phase, participants first heard a very soft 1200 Hz sound and
adjusted its volume using on-screen buttons until it was barely audible. If calibrated correctly
by the participants, the louder sound was played at a level 60 dB SPL above the hearing
threshold. Using Audacity, we normalised the average volume of the story to that of the louder
sound. This method ensured that, although the story was not played during the calibration
phase, it would be presented at the intended volume of approximately 60 dB when the actual
conditioning paradigm began. The calibration phase for Group 8 (Sound CS) was identical to
the calibration phase for Group 7.
The calibration procedure in Group 9 (Sound US) and Group 10 (Overlap CS-US) closely
resembled that of Group 7, with the main difference being the volume difference between the
two test sounds, which was 85 dB instead of 60 dB. After adjusting the volume for the first test
tone, participants encountered the second test sound (approximately 85 dB). Participants were
then asked to evaluate whether this volume level was acceptable or painfully loud. If they
found it to be intolerable, they could reduce the volume by clicking a button on the screen,
which would decrease the loudness by 5 dB. Using Audacity, the volume of US was set to
match the louder of the two test sounds. It should be noted that before deploying the paradigm,
we conducted numerous tests using this calibration procedure on various computer devices
and measured the US volume using a precise sound meter. In reality, the US volume was
closer to 90 dB than to 85 dB. This is because when participants reported that they could
barely hear the softer of the two 1200 Hz sounds, the softer sound was not at 0 dB.
Conditioning
There were a total of 12 groups, each differing from others in some aspects of the experimental
paradigm. The selection of these aspects is the result of a series of meetings with six
conditioning experts aiming to reach consensus on the conditions most important from a
theoretical point of view. This was done based on each of the experts creating a rank-order of
the most important procedural variations and subsequent consensus through discussion. A
high degree of consensus was reached for the 12 procedural variations (groups) that should
have the strongest effects on contingency awareness.
Group 1: Reference group (Reference)
Circular and diamond-shaped images were used as the CS in the experiment. One of the
images was green and the other was blue, with the allocation of the colors being randomized
between participants. For each participant, one image was randomly chosen as CS+, whereas
the other was the CS-. Thus, CS+ and CS- differed in two features (shape and color).
Pictures served as unconditioned stimuli (US). Ten highly unpleasant pictures from the Nencki
Affective Picture System (NAPS) (Marchewka et al., 2014) were chosen on the basis of their
method of matching fear and disgust values to divide the initial set of ten pictures into two
similar groups of five. For each participant, one group of pictures was used randomly as the
US during the acquisition phase, while the remaining five were used only in the US memory
task. In PsychoPy, we utilized height units to scale the sizes of images relative to the window
height. The 'US' image had dimensions (width, height) of (0.5, 0.5), indicating that both its
width and height were 50% of the window's height. Similarly, the 'CS' image size was set at
(0.3, 0.3).
The experiment was subdivided into several phases. During the baseline phase, participants
were asked to rate the CS for valence (“How pleasant is the feeling that this picture evokes in
you?”; 0 = "Very unpleasant", 50 = "Neutral", 100 = "Very pleasant"), arousal ("How intense or
arousing is the feeling that this picture evokes in you? "; 0 = "Not at all", 100 = "Very intense")
and fear ("How anxious does this shape currently make you feel? "; 0 = "Not at all", 100 =
"Very anxious"). Participants were first asked to rate a white square, which served as a training
to use the rating system, and after that rate the circle and diamond. The circle and the diamond
were presented in a random order.
Before the acquisition phase, the participants were instructed to look at the screen at all times,
and that unpleasant pictures would sometimes be presented, but they did not receive explicit
instructions about the CS-US contingency. During the acquisition phase, participants
completed a total of 22 trials (11 per CS). Each trial lasted for 7 seconds. After a 1-second
fixation cross, the CS was presented for 6 seconds, after which a CS+ was always followed
by a 1-second presentation of a US (100% reinforcement rate), and the CS- was followed by
a blank screen. Trials were separated by an intertrial interval (ITI) filled with a blank screen for
6-12 seconds. No more than two stimuli belonging to the same condition were presented
consecutively. The schematic diagram of the conditioning procedure is shown in Fig. 1b.
After the acquisition phase, we assessed participants' awareness of the contingencies.
Participants were asked, "Did you notice that an unpleasant picture was shown after seeing a
specific colored shape?" Those who answered "Yes" were shown both CS side by side and
asked to select which one was followed by unpleasant pictures. Next, they rated their
confidence in their choice on a scale from 0 ("Not at all") to 100 ("Absolutely confident").
Afterwards, participants rated likelihood of an unpleasant picture following each CS on a scale
(0 = "Certainly not", 50 = "Uncertain", 100 = "Certainly") and then repeated the affective ratings
(valence, arousal, and fear) for the two CS in random order.
The extinction phase commenced after the acquisition phase, following the same general
procedure. It consisted of 14 trials in total (7 per CS), with no unpleasant pictures presented
anymore. Participants were not informed before the extinction phase that unpleasant pictures
would not be shown anymore. Similar to the acquisition phase, after extinction, participants
were asked to provide their expectancy ratings for unpleasant pictures following each CS, as
well as provide affective ratings for the two shapes.
After the extinction phase of the task, the US memory task was administered. The participants
were presented with the five pictures that had previously served as the US, and an additional
set of five novel pictures. For each picture, participants had to answer (Yes/No) if they had
encountered this picture previously during the experiment. Finally, participants were requested
to complete valence and arousal ratings for the US.
Group 2: Online fear ratings (Fear ratings)
The procedural parameters were identical to those of Group 1, except for the presence of
intermittent fear ratings during presentation of the CS. In the acquisition phase, participants
were asked to rate how anxious the shape made them feel using a visual analogue scale (0 =
"Not at all", 100 = "Very anxious") during the presentation of CS on trials 1, 2, 11, 12, 21, and
22. The scale was placed underneath the CS (see Fig. 1 for a visual representation). Each
set of two ratings included one CS+ and one CS- trial in a random order. No ratings appeared
in the other trials. In the extinction phase, similar ratings were shown during CS on trials 1, 2,
13, and 14.
Group 3: Online US-expectancy ratings (Expectancy ratings)
The procedural parameters were identical to those of Group 2, except for the presence of
intermittent US-expectancy ratings during presentation of the CS. Using the same scale as
was used for collecting expectancy ratings after acquisition, participants rated the expectancy
during the presentation of CS in the same trials as described above for Group 2.
Group 4: Partial reinforcement rate (Partial reinforcement)
The procedural parameters were identical to those of Group 1, except for a 55% (6 times
instead of 100% - 11 times) reinforcement rate during the acquisition phase. The first CS+ trial
was always reinforced, and the remaining five CS-US pairings were distributed randomly over
the acquisition phase.
Group 5: Trace conditioning (Trace)
The procedural parameters were identical to those of Group 1, except that a 2-s blank interval
was inserted between CS+ offset and US presentation.
Group 6: Habituation phase (Habituation)
The procedural parameters were identical to those of Group 1, except for a habituation phase
before acquisition. The habituation phase consisted of 14 trials in total (7 per CS) and was
identical to the extinction phase of the task.
Group 7: Concurrent listening to a story (Story)
The procedural parameters were similar to Group 1, with the exception of stricter controlled
inter-trial intervals (ITIs) and the addition of a concurrent task (listening to a story) during the
acquisition phase.
Before the experiment began, participants were asked to put on headphones and to not
remove them during the experiment. Additionally, they were instructed to set the computer
system's volume to 100%. The participants were informed that they would hear an audio story
and, after the end of the story, they would be asked questions on its content. Throughout the
acquisition phase, participants were instructed to both listen to the story and look at the screen.
In Group 1, the blank screen during ITIs varied randomly between 6 and 12 seconds. In Group
7, 22 random integers between 6 and 12 were first generated under the condition that the sum
of the 22 numbers was 198, i.e., 22 multiplied by 9. These 22 numbers were then randomly
assigned to the 22 blank screen sections in ITIs. The objective of this procedure was to
maintain the duration of the acquisition phase at precisely 6 minutes and 14 seconds to match
the duration of the audio story and the average duration of the acquisition phase in Group 1.
Prior to entering the extinction phase, participants answered five questions related to the
aforementioned story (see Appendix for the list of the questions and specifics on the story).
Group 8: Tones as the CSs (Sound CS)
The procedural parameters were identical to those of Group 1, except for using sounds as
CSs. Two tones (6-second long) with frequencies of 1000 Hz and 1400 Hz were used as CSs.
Group 9: Loud noise as the US (Sound US)
The procedural parameters were identical to those of Group 1, except for using a loud noise
as US. A 1,000 Hz sine wave was embedded into a 1-second burst of white noise to serve as
the US.
Group 10: Overlap CS-US
The procedural parameters were identical to those of Group 9, except for the presentation of
the US occurring 500 ms before the end of the CS+ presentation.
Group 11: Unspecific instruction
The procedural parameters were identical to those of Group 2, except for using a modified
instruction before the acquisition phase. Instead of only stating that there will be shapes and
occasional potential pictures, the following phrase was added: "one of the shapes will always
be followed by an unpleasant picture. Your task is to find out which one".
Group 12: Specific instruction
The procedural parameters were identical to those of Group 11, except for making the
instruction even more specific: e.g., "the circle will always be followed by an unpleasant picture
and the diamond will not".
Attention checks
Two Instructional Manipulation Checks (IMCs) were presented in all groups. The IMCs
explicitly instructed participants to complete a task in a certain way, aiming to verify whether
they paid attention to the instructions given during the study. One of the IMCs in this study
was presented in the questionnaire phase and the other in the pre-acquisition phase of the
conditioning task. The US memory task also served as an attention check, but was not
implemented in Groups 9 and 10, where the US was a loud noise instead of pictures.
For groups where we employed auditory stimuli, specifically groups 7 to 10, we added another
IMC to identify participants who did not wear their headphones for the whole duration of the
experiment. Prior to the extinction phase, participants received an auditory instruction "Please
choose number nine", while an on-screen instruction stated “Please follow the instruction”. A
set of numbers from 0 to 9 was displayed on the screen for selection.
We also gathered self-reported attention levels from the participants in all groups. In all groups
except 9 and 10, participants responded to a single question: "How frequently did you look
away from the screen during the presentation of unpleasant pictures? Please answer honestly.
Your response will NOT affect your reward or cause any other consequences." with responses
ranging from 0 ("Never") to 100 ("Always"). In Groups 9 and 10, participants were asked two
questions: the first regarding the frequency of removing their headphones during the
presentation of loud noises, measured using a slider from 0% to 100%; and the second
concerning whether they lowered the volume on their PCs during the presentation of the noise,
with the response options being "Yes" or "No".
On the basis of these tests, participants were excluded from the statistical analyses if they met
any of the following criteria: a. Non-compliance with instructions in two main IMCs (applicable
to all groups); b. Attaining an accuracy score of less than 80% on the US memory task
(applicable to all groups except groups 9 and 10); c. Inability to adhere to the auditory
instruction of selecting number 9 (applicable to groups 7 to 10); d. Having less than two correct
responses to questions related to the story presented during the acquisition phase (limited to
group 7); e. Taking off the headphones (>= 20% response to the question "How frequently did
you remove your headphones when you heard the loud noise?"; 0% = "Never", 100% =
"Always") or reducing the system volume during the experiment (relevant only to groups 9 and
10). A total of 153 persons were excluded from the statistical analysis on the basis of the
Awareness definition
We classified participants as being aware of the contingencies if they met two criteria: (i) they
gave a positive response to the contingency awareness question and correctly identified the
shape (or sound in Group 8) used as CS+, and (ii) they reported greater US-expectancy after
the CS+ than after the CS-. Those not meeting at least one of these criteria were considered
"unaware". This procedure of using two awareness tests is in line with recent
recommendations on studying unaware processes (Shanks, 2017).
Confirmatory analyses
To explore how awareness influenced CS affective ratings (H.1; see list of specific hypotheses
in Appendix), repeated measures ANOVAs were employed, followed by Holm-Sidak post-hoc
tests. The ANOVAs included within-subject factors Time (baseline, post-acquisition, and post-
extinction) and CS type (CS+ vs. CS-) and between-subject factor Awareness (yes vs. no).
For comparing contingency awareness rates between groups (H.2-10), we used chi-squared
tests. When dealing with three levels of the variable (Type of instruction), we initially conducted
a chi-square test. If this yielded a significant result, we conducted post-hoc pairwise
comparisons.
To validate the reliability of the chi-square test results, we conducted regression analyses
where we controlled for potential confounding effects due to imbalanced variables between
groups. Specifically, in binary logistic regression models, we used 'group' as the independent
variable and 'contingency awareness' as the dependent variable, while also including
significant variables identified in the homogeneity tests as covariates.
To assess the homogeneity of the groups, we compared demographic variables, personality
traits, working memory, mind wandering, and US affective ratings across the groups. We
employed chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. For normally distributed
continuous variables, we used ANOVA or t-tests, while we used the Mann-Whitney U test or
the Kruskal-Wallis test for non-normally distributed continuous variables. These comparisons
were conducted separately for two groups corresponding to each variable. In the case where
a variable (Type of instruction) had three levels, we began with an overall test. If this test
yielded a significant result, we proceeded with post-hoc pairwise comparisons.
The effect of including a habituation phase before the acquisition phase on average differential
fear ratings (H.5.2) was assessed using a t-test. This test compared the differences in average
differential fear ratings between aware participants in group 6 and group 1.
To investigate how individual differences modulate the probability to acquire awareness (H.11-
15), we performed a two-step statistical analysis. In the first step, we compared demographic
and psychological characteristics between aware and unaware participants. For categorical
variables, we used Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests. For normally distributed continuous
variables, we employed independent samples t-tests, and for non-normally distributed
continuous variables, we used Mann-Whitney U tests. In the second step, we conducted a
multivariate analysis using binary logistic regression to identify independent factors that could
explain variations in contingency awareness. This multivariate analysis included only variables
with p-values below 0.005 in the univariate analyses.
All p-values were two-tailed, and a significance level of 0.005 was used for the tests involving
all 12 groups (H.1, H.11-15). For H.2-10 and ‘Checks of homogeneity of the groups’ the alpha
level was set at 0.05.
Results
Contingency awareness rate comparison between the groups
Participants were classified as aware of the contingencies if they correctly identified the CS+
in a two-alternative forced choice question that presented both CS+ and CS- stimuli (e.g., two
shapes), and if they demonstrated greater US-expectancy following the CS+ compared to the
1 for group sample sizes).
The highest awareness rates were observed in groups where we employed a loud noise as
the US (94.7% and 96%), while in the other multimodal conditioning group (auditory CS paired
with visual US) the awareness rate was lower than in the reference (53.3%). The lowest rates
were seen in groups that listened to a concurrent story (48%) and where fear ratings were
displayed during the presentation of the conditioned stimulus (47.2%), suggesting a strong
effect of distraction from the task. Interestingly, the presentation of another type of rating -
expectancy - overrode the effect of diverted attention, pushing the contingency awareness
rate up to 90.7%.
Adding more specificity in the instruction produced the expected effect of an increase in
awareness rates (unspecific: 82.7%; specific: 73.3% as compared with the reference 47.2%).
Unexpectedly, however, the specific instruction effect was numerically (but not significantly)
weaker as compared to the unspecific instruction.
Introduction of the habituation phase, decreasing reinforcement rate, and adding a 2-second
long trace did not produce significant effects on the awareness rate as compared with the
respective reference group. Similarly, the effect of introducing an overlap in time between CS
and US was negligible.

Notes. The group with CS and US (loud noise) overlapping in time (Overlap CS-US) used the Sound
US group as its reference. Both the group given unspecific instructions and the group given specific
instructions were compared with the group where concurrent fear ratings were presented (fear ratings)
as their benchmark for comparison. A significant difference in the rates of aware subjects was found
among the groups: Fear Ratings, Unspecific instruction, and Specific Instruction ( ²(2) = 22.69, p <
0.001).

Homogeneity checks) in logistic regression models did not alter the results of the chi-square
Learning variation between groups
In our preregistration, based on the literature, we laid out the hypothesis that introduction of a
habituation phase would decrease differential conditioning indicators (affective ratings). This
hypothesis was not confirmed. In a set of exploratory analyses, we compared the affective
ratings of CS and the differences between them (CS+ minus CS-) across all twelve groups of
aware participants in the post-acquisition phase. Independent sample t-tests were carried out.
The weakest differential fear-conditioned responses were observed in Story, Sound CS, and
Fear ratings, the three conditions that also had the lowest contingency awareness rates. The
highest ratings were observed in the groups with CS-US overlap (having a loud noise as US)
and concurrent expectancy ratings.
Despite the large difference between the awareness rates, using a loud noise as US did not
produce stronger learning effects compared to the reference group as expressed in the
differential affective ratings.
Using sounds as CSs significantly increased conditioned responses, as shown by higher fear
ratings for both CS+ and CS-, but the difference between them was small, especially in the
valence ratings.
Furthermore, incorporating online fear ratings also heightened fear responses, particularly for
CS-, thus decreasing the CS+/CS- difference. Conversely, both unspecific and specific
instructions decreased fear responses to CS- but did not affect the magnitude of differential
Awareness and learning indicators
We tested whether differential learning would differ between participants who became aware
or remained unaware of the contingencies in the whole sample. A highly significant interaction
of Awareness x CS type x Time was observed in all evaluative learning indicators (i.e.,
affective ratings), including valence, arousal, and fear (all ps < 0.001) in the ANOVAs (refer to
and CS- ratings at various phases (baseline, post-acquisition, and post-extinction), separately
in the aware and unaware participant groups.
As depicted in Fig. 3, at baseline, aware participants showed no significant difference in
valence, arousal, and fear ratings between CS+ and CS- (valence: t(893) = 1.49, p = 0.136, d
= 0.05; arousal: t(893) = 0.02, p = 0.988, d < 0.01; fear: t(893) = 1.89, p = 0.059, d = 0.06).
However, in the post-acquisition phase, CS+ was evaluated significantly lower in valence
(t(893) = 29.35, p < 0.001, d = 0.98), higher in arousal (t(893) = 19.94, p < 0.001, d = 0.67),
and higher in fear (t(893) = 32.84, p < 0.001, d = 1.10) compared to CS-. Similar trends were
observed in the post-extinction phase, with CS+ showing lower valence (t(893) = 16.35, p <
0.001, d = 0.55), higher arousal (t(893) = 11.13, p < 0.001, d = 0.37), and higher fear ratings
(t(893) = 19.73, p < 0.001, d = 0.66) than CS-.
In contrast, the unaware participants showed no significant differences between CS+ and CS-
across all three learning indicators - valence, arousal, and fear - at any of the three time points
(baseline, post-acquisition, and post-extinction), with all p-values exceeding 0.05.
These findings are supported by Bayesian t-tests, which provided very strong evidence for
differential conditioning in the aware participants and strong evidence against conditioning in
the unaware participants (fear ratings after acquisition; aware: BF = 2.41·10 , unaware:
BF = 0.108).

Predicting awareness by demographics, personality, cognitive
performance and emotional response to the US
to assess their contribution to the probability of becoming aware of the contingencies. In the
univariate analyses, consuming alcohol within 2 hours before the experiment (12 participants
in the whole sample of 895) and rating the US as more unpleasant (i.e., giving lower valence
ratings) significantly affected the probability to become aware of the contingencies (p-values
below 0.005), justifying (as per preregistration) inclusion of these variables in a multiple logistic
regression model. However, in this model, the effects became even smaller: 'alcohol' had a
Wald χ² of 7.45, an odds ratio (OR) of 5.415 (95% CI: 1.610 to 18.214, p = 0.006), while
'valence ratings of US' had a Wald χ² of 4.81, an OR of 0.989 (95% CI: 0.980 to 0.999, p =
0.028).
The difference between aware and unaware participants in their valence ratings of the US in
the univariate analysis may be due to lower ratings of the loud noise as compared with the
images. Indeed, the valence of the loud noise as US (groups Sound US and Overlap CS-US)
was significantly lower (i.e., the noise was more unpleasant) as compared with aversive
images as US (all other groups): 5.79 ± 11.21 and 17.80 ± 14.85 for the noise and the pictures,
respectively, (t(893) = 9.38, p < 0.001). Similarly, the US arousal ratings of negative images
scored 59.44 ± 27.08, and for loud noise as the US, the score was 73.97 ± 29.93, also
When we excluded the two groups with a loud noise as the US (Sound US and Overlap CS-

Note. %For the working memory accuracy and mind wandering, three participants had incomplete data,
so the number of participants included in the analyses was 892. +The variable was analysed by Fisher's
exact test (the same as below). Mind wandering, valence ratings of US and arousal ratings of US were
reported as the median (first quartile, third quartile), and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for the
analyses. The means of mind wandering were 1.44 [SD = 1.74] and 1.32 [SD = 1.58] for unaware and
aware groups, respectively. The means of US valence ratings were 17.62 [SD = 14.73] and 15.10 [SD
= 15.03] for unaware and aware subjects, respectively. The means of US arousal ratings were 58.54
[SD = 28.84] and 63.12 [SD = 27.72] for unaware and aware participants, respectively. In the statistical
analysis, Cramér's V was used to measure the effect size for the chi-square test (variable Sex to
Socioeconomic status), Cohen's d for the t-test (variables Age to BIS), and r for the Mann-Whitney U-
test (variables Working memory capacity to Arousal ratings of US). Cramér's V ranges from 0 to 1, with
values close to 1 suggesting a strong association and values near 0 indicating minimal or no
association. Cohen's d values can extend from negative to positive infinity, with larger absolute values
indicating more substantial differences between groups. For the Mann-Whitney U-test, the effect size r
varies from -1 to 1, with values at the extremes reflecting perfect relationships, either negative or
positive, while values near 0 denote the absence of a relationship.
Correlations among the continuous variables
As a part of our exploratory analyses, we investigated the relationship between continuous
differential expectancy ratings (CS+ minus CS- expectancy) post-acquisition (as an
approximate continuous measure of awareness) and other continuous variables (see Fig. 4).
Additionally, in our large sample, we tested the commonly observed correlations, such as the
one between fear-conditioned responses and anxiety.
Trait anxiety showed a significant positive correlation with fear ratings for CS-. Notably, the
negative correlation between state anxiety and the difference in fear ratings of CS+ and CS-
appears to be driven by heightened fear responses to CS- in more anxious individuals, rather
than by low fear ratings of CS+ in less anxious participants. BIS score, inversely coded, was
negatively and significantly correlated with fear CS+ ratings, indicating that a higher BIS level
is associated with increased fear responses to CS+. IUS was positively and significantly
correlated with fear ratings for both CS+ and CS-, but not with differential score.
Avoidance behavior, as indicated by the time spent looking away from unpleasant US pictures,
was significantly correlated with fearful responses towards both CS+ and CS-, but showed no
correlation with differential fear ratings. This behavior also had significant associations with
common measures of avoidance as a personality trait, like the BIS score. Furthermore,
susceptibility to mind wandering, as a personality trait related to the ability to maintain attention
to the task and resist intrinsic distracting thoughts, was positively related to the time spent
looking away.
Working memory failed to show any relationship with fear and other affective ratings, yet it
was significantly correlated with the differential expectancy ratings. Specifically, the better
working memory was associated with a larger difference between CS+ and CS- expectancy
ratings.

as follows: STAI1 denotes trait anxiety, and STAI2 represents state anxiety. BAS1, BAS2, and
BAS3 correspond to BAS Drive, BAS Fun Seeking, and BAS Reward Responsiveness,
respectively. 'Memory' refers to the accuracy of working memory, 'Wandering' to the incidence
of mind wandering during the working memory task, and 'LookAway' to the frequency of
looking away from the screen during the presentation of unpleasant pictures. Fear
measurements include FearCS+ and FearCS- for the fear ratings of CS+ and CS-,
respectively, with FearD capturing the difference between these ratings. For US-expectancies,
ExpectCS+ and ExpectCS- pertain to CS+ and CS-, respectively, with ExpectancyD illustrating
the differences between these expectancies. ValenceD and ArousalD are used to describe
the differences in valence and arousal ratings between CS+ and CS-, respectively.
Assessments for FearCS+, FearCS-, FearD, ExpectCS+, ExpectCS-, ExpectancyD,
ValenceD, and ArousalD all took place after the acquisition phase. Participant counts were as

correlations. All correlations are Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. ***p < 0.005.
Discussion
In this study, we investigated the impact of contingency awareness on fear conditioning across
a large online sample of adults. The effect was clear and unequivocal: fear conditioning was
observed exclusively among participants who reported explicit contingency awareness, as
evidenced by significant changes in affective responses to the CS, suggesting that fear
conditioning does not occur without contingency awareness. Furthermore, we identified
several experimental factors that affected the acquisition of contingency awareness: the
presence of online fear ratings, the presence of online US-expectancy ratings, engagement in
concurrent tasks, the sensory modality of the CS, the sensory modality of the US, and the
instructions provided. Lastly, we found no evidence that personality traits, cognitive abilities,
or demographic factors moderate the process of awareness acquisition.
Conditioned affective responses were observed only in participants who were aware of the
contingencies. This finding is aligning with the outcomes of some prior studies (Baeuchl et al.,
2019; Glenn et al., 2012; Klucken et al., 2009; Tabbert et al., 2011), but in contrast to others
that suggested that fear conditioning may not necessitate awareness of contingency (Raio et
al., 2012; Schultz & Helmstetter, 2010; Steinberg et al., 2012). We believe that many previous
studies that demonstrated unaware learning did not carefully filter out aware participants from
the unaware group or condition. In a seminal review, Lovibond and Shanks pointed out that
numerous studies on conditioning have employed inadequate measures to assess
awareness, thus questioning the validity of findings supporting conditioning without awareness
(Lovibond & Shanks, 2002). Likewise, a meta-analysis revealed that a significant proportion
of studies on fear conditioning suffered from methodological limitations; particularly, studies
employed poor awareness measures and provided the researchers with too many degrees of
freedom (Mertens & Engelhard, 2020). Moreover, this analysis indicated that higher-quality
studies were less likely to affirm the possibility of conditioning in the absence of contingency
awareness. Our study adds more high-quality evidence against the possibility of fear
conditioning without contingency awareness.
We varied several design parameters between 12 groups of participants to understand which
parameters have the potency to modulate contingency awareness. Summarising the
evidence, direction of attention during conditioning was the most crucial factor affecting
awareness. Introducing online fear ratings or instructing participants to listen to a concurrently
presented story during the acquisition phase with the goal of diverting their attention away
from the CS-US relationship hindered the acquisition of awareness. In contrast, the use of
instructions containing contingency information or the implementation of online US-
expectancy ratings during the acquisition phase markedly focused participants' attention on
the CS-US relationship. Interestingly, stronger facilitating learning effects of unspecific
instructions (e.g., "one of the shapes will always be followed by an unpleasant picture. Your
task is to find out which one") as compared with maximally specific instructions (e.g., "the circle
will always be followed by an unpleasant picture and the diamond will not") has been shown
previously (Mertens et al., 2021). This observation is consistent with the stated role of attention
in steering the cognitive processing system toward a specific subset of available information
(McDowd, 2007). Unspecific instruction directs participants’ attention to the stimuli, whereas
complete, exhaustive a-priori information may diminish the engagement of active attention
mechanisms. Some previous studies directly manipulated contingency awareness by altering
participants' attention. For example, Kattner (2012) diverted participants' attention away from
either the stimulus itself or from the CS-US relationship through two distinct distraction tasks
(full-distraction task or contingency-distraction task), demonstrating that both can effectively
decrease the acquisition of contingency awareness (Kattner, 2012). Other studies shifted
participants' attention through instructions, such as partially or fully informing them of the CS-
US relationship before the fear acquisition phase, which has also been proven to be an
effective method for altering contingency awareness rate (Dawson & Biferno, 1973; Mertens
et al., 2021; Tabbert et al., 2011). Altogether available evidence underscore the relationship
between the direction of attention and the acquisition of awareness.
The sensory modalities of the CS and US were identified as significant experimental variables
that substantially influence the acquisition of awareness. Auditory CS, compared to visual CS,
appeared to decrease the likelihood of acquiring awareness. This reduction may stem from
the increased difficulty in perceiving and distinguishing auditory stimuli as opposed to visual
stimuli, which in turn impedes the acquisition of awareness. Alternatively, the auditory stimuli
may have distracted participants from the screen. However, using loud noise as the US,
instead of unpleasant images, enhanced the acquisition of awareness. The loud noise
provoked significantly more negative emotional responses than the negative images and,
being hard to ignore without breaching the task requirements, likely compelled participants to
be attentive to the noise and to recognize its predictive signal (CS+), thus facilitating the
acquisition of contingency awareness.
Among other factors, pre-exposure to CSs and US can influence subsequent conditioning
processes. Research involving both human and animal subjects has demonstrated that such
pre-exposure leads to latent inhibition, which is marked by reduced conditioned responses
(Jordan et al., 2015; Meulders et al., 2012; Vaitl & Lipp, 1997). Contrary to the expectation,
our study did not observe a reduction in conditioning among participants who underwent a
habituation phase. Thus, the effects of habituation on fear acquisition, previously obtained
primarily in animal studies, failed to replicate in a large human fear conditioning study.
When examining the most effective differential conditioning, we observed that the paradigm
with overlapping CS and loud noise US demonstrated the strongest conditioning effects. This
should be viewed in the context of many participants being excluded due to a failure to follow
instructions, such as altering the US stimulus parameters to make them less aversive, or
avoiding it entirely–behaviours enabled in the online setting. With aversive images as US, the
factors contributing to awareness were unspecific instructions (which encourage curiosity and
exploration in the CS-US association) and the use of expectancy ratings (which directs
participants’ attention to the fact that the US appears only after particular CS). A combination
of giving instruction, using a strongly aversive US, and the absence of distractors is thus
expected to result in maximizing contingency awareness along with increasing learning
effects, given their strong relationship.
If we refrain from interpreting the result that twelve participants who had consumed alcohol
before the experiment were less likely to become aware of the contingencies, and if we
concentrate on the remaining 98.7% of participants, we found no significant impact of the inter-
individual variability in demographics, personality traits, and cognitive abilities on the
acquisition of awareness. First of all, taking into account our sample size, this finding differs
from similar results in the literature because it cannot be attributed to a beta error.
Furthermore, the variables used to characterize participants were not invalid in general, as
they correlated with fear conditioning in a predictable way: Anxiety, behavioural inhibition, and
avoidance behaviour were significantly related to fear ratings in conditioning experiments.
However, neither these nor other variables increased or decreased the probability of becoming
aware of the contingencies. One may speculate that the ability to explicitly formulate the
acquired knowledge of a new association is a specific feature possibly related to verbal
abilities. Although working memory generally correlates with verbal intelligence, the WM test
used in the present study may be too unspecific in this relation. From this point of view, not
only performance in specific verbal intelligence tasks would be of interest but also hypothesis-
driven fMRI experiments looking for links between contingency awareness and the activity in
the left frontal and temporal areas.
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to systematically investigate how
experimental parameters influence the acquisition of contingency awareness, identifying
seven effective parameters to inform the selection of optimal experimental settings for future
research. Additionally, by recruiting 895 participants online from across the globe, this study
not only achieved robust statistical power but also enhanced the representativeness of the
sample. The main limitation of the study is its exclusive reliance on self-report measures of
conditioning due to the lack of physiological recordings. Future research could explore the
integration of physiological markers, such as pupil dilation or heart rate, into online
experiments to enhance the validity of the findings.
Conclusions
The present study investigated the relationship between contingency awareness and fear
conditioning, providing decisive support for the notion that the manifestation of conditioned
fear in affective ratings of the CS necessarily requires awareness of the relationship between
the CS and US. This finding reinforces the idea that fear conditioning relies on a single learning
mechanism (Lovibond & Shanks, 2002), thereby deepening our comprehension of how people
learn from fear-related experiences. Highlighting the significant impact of experimental
settings on the development of awareness, the application of specific changes to the
experimental paradigm alters the contingency awareness rate, ranging from 47% to 96%, with
the strongest effects being exerted by manipulations of attentional focus. This underscores
the importance of carefully choosing experimental parameters to align with a given study's
objectives. For example, to create a group of participants who are not aware of the
conditioning, effective strategies include using distraction tasks or giving instructions that do
not mention the relationship between stimuli. On the other hand, to encourage awareness,
providing instructions prompting curiosity and active engagement or using a stronger US are
beneficial. Lastly, our findings suggest that while individual differences should not be
overlooked as they play a significant role in shaping fear conditioning outcomes (Lonsdorf &
Merz, 2017), the role of individual differences in predicting awareness is negligible.
