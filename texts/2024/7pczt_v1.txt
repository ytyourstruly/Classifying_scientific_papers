Abstract
Studies on serial dependence demonstrated that perceptual reports exhibit systematic biases in
relation to the task-irrelevant previous stimulus. Does this phenomenon reflect distortions in the
stimulus representation itself or biases in post-perceptual decision-making? To answer this
question, the present study investigated how quickly the decision for a new stimulus is initiated
by measuring response initiation time (RTI) and how the decision unfolds over time by
measuring response trajectories for the mouse reports in orientation delayed estimation tasks. We
hypothesized that the two variables (i.e., RTI and response trajectory) should be independent of
the previous stimulus if the bias is driven by distortions in the representation itself, whereas they
should vary systematically in relation to the previous stimulus if the bias is driven by post-
perceptual decision processes. In two experiments, we found that 1) RTI was slower when the
current stimulus was similar to the previous stimulus, indicating that the decision was more
difficult for such trials, and 2) mouse reports started from the opposite side of the previous
stimulus, indicating that the decision was executed by avoiding the previous stimulus. Critically,
similar decisional dynamics were observed irrespective of the direction of serial dependence.
Together, these results provide converging evidence that both repulsive and attractive serial
dependence are driven by processes that integrate previous stimuli into the decision for a new
stimulus, placing significant constraints on the theories that assume that serial dependence
reflects the distortions in the representation itself.

Introduction
Studies of serial dependence have demonstrated that our ongoing thoughts and behaviors are
systematically influenced by recent perceptual experiences. For example, in an orientation
working memory (WM) task, reports are biased toward the previous-trial stimulus depending on
the similarity between the stimuli in two consecutive trials (Fischer & Whitney, 2014; Kiyonaga
et al., 2017; Pascucci et al., 2023). Serial dependence occurs in the processing of a variety of
visual stimuli, including color (Barbosa & Compte, 2020), location (Bliss et al., 2017),
numerosity (Fornaciai & Park, 2018), and faces (Liberman et al., 2014). The generalizability of
this phenomenon may indicate that the visual system stabilizes perceptual experiences over time
by relating new visual inputs to the information obtained in the recent past (Cicchini et al., 2024;
Kiyonaga et al., 2017; Manassi & Whitney, 2024; Pascucci et al., 2023).
While the majority of studies on serial dependence reported attractive biases, there is now
ample evidence that perceptual reports can also be biased away from the previous stimulus (Bae,
2024; Bae & Luck, 2017, 2019, 2020; Bansal et al., 2023; Bliss et al., 2017; Ceylan & Pascucci,
2023; Chen & Bae, 2024; Fritsche et al., 2017; Shan & Postle, 2022). Although the exact nature
of the opposing directions of serial dependence is still unclear (Pascucci et al., 2023), studies
generally agree that serial dependence is a complex phenomenon where the direction and
magnitude of the bias are influenced by multiple factors, such as the length of the delay (Bliss et
al., 2017), specific task demand (Bae & Luck, 2020; Ceylan & Pascucci, 2023), specific stimulus
values being reported (Bae, 2024), and the way the stimulus is maintained in working memory
(Chen & Bae, 2024). These findings indicate that a simple computational principle is likely to
fail to capture the large variability in the serial dependence phenomenon (Ceylan & Pascucci,
2023).
However, there have been attempts to explain serial dependence by combining two
computational principles (Fritsche et al., 2020; Moon & Kwon, 2022; Pascucci et al., 2019).
According to the two-process framework, repulsive bias occurs during perceptual encoding via
adaptation-like processes (i.e., Efficient encoding), while attractive bias occurs during post-
perceptual decision processes (i.e., Bayesian decoding), and the direction of the bias in the
reports is determined by the relative strength of the two mechanisms. Although this framework
has been successful in explaining concurrent attractive and repulsive serial dependence under
some task contexts (Fritsche et al., 2020; Moon & Kwon, 2022; Pascucci et al., 2019), evidence
inconsistent with this framework have also been observed. For example, studies found that
attractive serial dependence may occur during perceptual encoding (Cicchini et al., 2017, 2021;
Fischer & Whitney, 2014; Fornaciai & Park, 2018) and repulsive serial dependence may also
recruit post-perceptual decision processes (Bae & Chen, 2024; Chen & Bae, 2024), leaving the
processing stage at which the bias emerges inconclusive.
Here, we investigated the processing stages for serial dependence by focusing on the
began with the observation that almost all previous serial dependence studies focused only on the
angular response errors (i.e., the angular difference between the target and response at the time of
mouse click) in a continuous estimation task. Because the response errors reflect the combined
impact of multiple cognitive processes (e.g., perceptual encoding, working memory
maintenance, and post-perceptual decisions), inferring the processing stage for serial dependence
solely based on angular response error is necessarily a challenge. We therefore scrutinized
additional dependent variables — response initiation time (RTI) and mouse trajectory — that are
known to reflect decision-related processes (Kunde et al., 2004; Resulaj et al., 2009).

reproduced the remembered orientation of the sample teardrop after a delay by adjusting the test
teardrop using a computer mouse. The locations of the sample and test teardrops were held
constant across trials in Experiment 1, but they changed unpredictably in Experiment 2. The
response cue (i.e., black ring) was presented without a test teardrop at the location for the
orientation report. The test teardrop appeared only after participants moved the mouse for a
report. We measured the time difference between the onset of the response cue and the initiation
of the mouse movement (RTI: response initiation time) to examine the speed of response
initiation. During the mouse report, we measured the mouse trajectory to examine how the
response unfolds over time. b. RTI predictions. If serial dependence is a representational bias,
then RTI should be independent of the similarity between the previous- and current-trial
orientations (black). If, however, it is a decisional bias, then RTI should vary with the stimulus
similarity (blue). For example, RTI may be slower when the two consecutive stimuli are similar
because the decision can be more difficult in such trials. c. Response trajectory predictions.

representational bias, then response trajectory should exhibit a straight-line like pattern (black).
If, however, it is a decisional bias, then the trajectory should exhibit a curved pattern that reflects
the previous-trial orientation (blue).

Specifically, we predicted that response should be slower when the current stimulus is more
similar to the previous stimulus because the decision should be more difficult in such trials
(Kvam et al., 2023). To test these predictions, we measured the time for the response initiation
(i.e., RTI: the time difference between the onset of the response cue and the initiation of the
the time difference between the onset of the response cue and mouse click) reflects the sum of
the processes that translate the representation into a decision and physical execution for the
decision (Haith et al., 2016; Kunde et al., 2004), RTI should better reflect purer decision time
without the impact of physical movement time.
In the mouse trajectory analyses, we examined how the decision unfolds over time during
the mouse reports. We hypothesized that if serial dependence is a perceptual bias that occurs
before the decision stage, then the response should be executed independently of the previous
stimulus because the representation itself is biased, exhibiting a straight-line-like mouse
time in relation to the previous stimulus. For example, if the decision is made to avoid the
previous stimulus, then the trajectory may start from the opposite side of the previous stimulus
Bae, 2024). We predicted that this should be the case irrespective of the similarity between the
current and previous stimuli if the decisional processes incorporate the previous stimulus.
To foreshadow our main findings, we found that response initiation was slower when the
current stimulus was more similar to the previous stimulus and that the response trajectories
exhibited a curved pattern starting from the opposite side of the previous stimulus. Critically,
these decisional dynamics occurred irrespective of the direction of the serial dependence. These
results provide converging evidence that both repulsive and attractive serial dependence are
based on decisional processes that integrate task-irrelevant previous stimulus.
Method
Participants. Previous studies using a similar task paradigm to examine serial dependence
reported a large effect size (Cohen’s d > 1) (Bae & Luck, 2019; Ceylan et al., 2021). A power
analysis determined that a minimum of 15 participants is necessary to detect a large effect
(Cohen’s d = .8) with a statistical power of .8. The present study recruited a total of forty-six
participants between the ages of 18 and 30 with normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity
(Experiment 1: 14 females, 10 males; Experiment 2: 9 females, 13 males). All participants
provided written informed consent prior to participating in the experiment. This study was
approved by the Arizona State University Institutional Review Board.
Apparatus, stimuli & Procedure. The stimuli were generated using Psychophysics Toolbox
(Brainard, 1997) and MATLAB (The MathWorks, MA) and presented on an LCD monitor (60
Hz) at viewing distance of approximately 100 cm. A black fixation dot was continuously present
in the center of the display except during the intertrial interval (ITI).
Experiment 1 was designed to produce repulsive serial dependence. Previous studies
confirmed repulsive serial dependence using a similar task design (e.g., Bae & Luck, 2019). A
black teardrop stimulus (2.86º long, 0.82° maximum width) was presented at the center of the
screen for 200 ms. The stimulus orientation was randomly sampled from a set of 16 discrete
orientations (11.25º to 348.75º in steps of 22.5º). After a 1000-ms delay, a response cue (a black
ring with a radius of 2.4º), but not the test teardrop, appeared at the center of the screen with the
mouse pointer to indicate the start of the response period. As soon as participants moved the
mouse pointer1, a test teardrop appeared, and the tip of the test teardrop continuously followed
the mouse pointer. Participants adjusted the orientation of the test teardrop to report the
remembered orientation and pressed a mouse button to submit their response. To ensure that
participants precisely adjust the orientation of the test teardrop, we had participants move the
mouse pointer outside of the response ring. The next trial started after a 500-ms blank screen
(ITI). Each participant completed 15 practice trials and 240 main experiment trials (15 trials for
each orientation x 16 orientations) which were presented in 3 blocks of 80 trials.
To measure how quickly participants initiated a response, we recorded the response
initiation time (RTI) by taking the time difference between the onset of the response cue and the
initiation of mouse movement. We also measured the total response time (i.e., the time difference
between the onset of the response cue and mouse click). The analysis of total response time is
reported in Supplementary material. To track how the decision unfolded over time (i.e., mouse
trajectory), we recorded the angular position of the test teardrop every 20 ms until the mouse
1 We note that continuous estimation procedures for orientation serial dependence present a
randomly orientated test object at the start of the response (e.g., Fischer & Whitney, 2014).
Because such a procedure makes it difficult to investigate the response time and response
trajectory, we presented a test object only after participants adjusted the mouse pointer for a
report (Bae & Chen, 2024).
click. The last angular position of the mouse trajectory for a given trial corresponded to the
reported orientation for that trial.
Experiment 2 was designed to produce attractive serial dependence by increasing the level
of uncertainty in the task: The delay was longer (5 seconds) than in Experiment 1 and the
locations for the sample and test teardrops were randomly and independently sampled from a set
of eight possible locations (30º, 60º, 120º, 150º, 210º, 240º, 300º, and 330º) on an invisible circle
(radius = 3.5º). Each participant completed 15 practice trials and 384 main experiment trials (3
trials for each stimulus orientation and stimulus location pair x 16 orientations) which were
presented in 6 blocks of 64 trials. Other aspects of task procedures in this experiment were
identical to those of Experiment 1.
Analyses. For each trial, we computed response errors by subtracting the stimulus
orientation from the reported orientation and then wrapped the errors within the [-180°, 180°]
range. Trials with the absolute response error greater than 60° were excluded from the analyses
(Experiment 1: .3% of total trials; Experiment 2: 2.66% of total trials) and trials with response
initiation time slower than 1s were also excluded (Experiment 1: .1% of total trials; Experiment
2: 3.69% of total trials) as they may reflect lapses of attention. Because our analyses focused on
serial dependence, the first trial of each block was necessarily excluded (three trials in
Experiment 1 and six trials in Experiment 2).
Serial dependence analysis. We subtracted the grand mean of response errors (averaged
across all the remaining trials after the exclusion) from response error for each trial to
compensate overall shift in the reports (Bliss et al., 2017; Fritsche et al., 2017). We then
computed response error for a given trial in relation to the orientation of the preceding trial. We
assigned positive sign for response errors away from the previous-trial stimulus and negative
sign for response errors toward it (Bae & Luck, 2019). Because the stimulus orientation was
sampled from a set of 16 discrete orientations in both experiments, each trial could be classified
into one of 9 absolute orientation differences (i.e., 0°, 22.5°, 45°, 67.5°, 90°, 112.5°, 135°,
157.5°, and 180°). The signed response errors were averaged for each absolute orientation
difference.
The magnitude of serial dependence is typically quantified by fitting a DoG (Derivative of
Gaussian) function (Fischer & Whitney, 2014), which can describe the bias for small stimulus
differences. However, studies found that serial dependence tends to exhibit opposite directions of
bias for small and large stimulus differences (“peripheral bump”) (Bae & Luck, 2019; Bliss et
al., 2017; Fritsche et al., 2017). Based on these findings, we computed the mean of signed
response errors for small (0°<Δ<90°) and large (90°<Δ<180°) orientation differences separately
and tested them against zero using one-sample t tests. Trials with 0° and 180° orientation
differences were excluded because the direction of the bias is undefined for those trials, and trials
with 90° orientation difference were excluded to balance the number of trials for small (i.e.,
22.5°, 45°, 67.5°) and large (i.e., 112.5°, 135°, 157.5°) orientation differences. We also
compared the two means (i.e., the mean for the small difference minus the mean for the large
difference) to test the presence of serial dependence across the small and large orientation
differences (paired t test).
Response initiation time (RTI) analysis. To investigate how quickly participants initiated
the decision, we measured the time difference between the onset of response cue and the
were initiated almost immediately after the onset of the response cue (i.e., immediate decision)
for some proportion of trials while they were initiated after some delay (i.e., delayed decision)
for other proportion of trials. We confirmed that the bimodality was evident in RTI for all
orientation differences (Supplementary material). These findings indicate that typical measures
of the central tendency (e.g., mean or median) do not accurately capture the discrete decision
states reflected in RTI distributions.

Response trajectory analysis. For each trial, the raw mouse trajectory was standardized by
computing the angular deviation between the orientation of the test teardrop from the stimulus
orientation at each time points in the trajectory. The angular deviation at the end of the trajectory
corresponded to response error. As in the basic serial dependence analysis, we assigned positive
sign to the deviation away from the previous-trial stimulus and negative sign to the deviation
toward the previous-trial stimulus. This signed trajectory was then averaged for small
(0º<Δ<90°) and large (90º<∆<180º) orientation differences. Because the length of response
trajectory varied across trials, computing the grand average of the trajectories irrespective of the
length can distort the true pattern of the trajectories. We therefore computed the mean of mouse
trajectories in two ways: we time-locked the trajectories to the onset of the mouse movement to
examine how the response trajectory started, and time-locked the trajectories to the mouse click
to examine how the response trajectory ended.
To statistically test whether the response trajectory exhibited a straight-line like pattern or
not, we compared the average of response trajectory between the initial 200 ms from the
trajectory time-locked to the onset of mouse movement and the last 200 ms from the trajectory
time-locked to the mouse click. The time window was determined based on previous studies
(Chen & Bae, 2024). If the response trajectory exhibited a straight-line-like pattern, then the
difference between the two time windows should be negligible. This was tested using a paired t
test. We found the same results when we used the very first and the last time points in the
trajectory for the statistical tests (Supplementary material).
Results
Repulsive and attractive serial dependence
In Experiment 1, orientation reports were biased away from the previous stimulus (i.e.,
positive error) when the current stimulus was similar to the previous stimulus whereas they were
biased toward the previous stimulus (i.e., negative error) when the current stimulus was
of response errors for small (0º<Δ<90°) and large (90º<Δ<180°) orientation differences. One-
sample t test confirmed that the repulsive bias for small orientation differences was significantly
greater than zero (M = 1.51º, t(23) = 4.02, p < .001, 95% CI = [.73º, 2.29º], Cohen’s d = .82) and
the attractive bias for large orientation differences was also significantly smaller than zero (M = -
.56º, t(23) = -2.11, p = .046, 95% CI = [-1.1º, -.01º], Cohen’s d = -.43). A paired t test confirmed
that the difference was significant (M = 2.07º, t(23) = 4.68, p < .001, 95% CI = [1.16º, 2.99º],
Cohen’s d = .96).

.94º], Cohen’s d = -.86, paired t test). These results demonstrate that the direction of serial
dependence can be reversed by the uncertainty driven by inconsistent locations and a longer WM
maintenance.
Response initiation time (RTI)
In both experiments, the RTI distributions exhibited bimodality for both small (0º≤Δ<90°)
the bimodality were different between small and large orientation differences. For example, there
was more trials near the second peak (i.e., delayed decision) for small orientation differences
than for large orientation differences in both experiments. To quantify this effect, we fit a log-
normal mixture model (see Method). The parameters of this model capture the proportion of
immediate and delayed decisions (P ), the speed of immediate and delayed decisions (μ and

Experiments 1 and 2. Due to variability in the length of response error trajectory across trials, the
average of the trajectories was calculated by time-locking the trajectories to the onset of the
initial mouse movement (left) and time-locking the trajectories to the mouse click (right). Ending
experiments, for both small and large orientation differences, orientation reports started from the
opposite side of the previous-trial orientation (i.e., positive error), reflecting the relative position
of the previous orientation. Shaded areas represent ±1 S.E.
The curved pattern of response trajectory might be driven by the rotation of the test teardrop
during the report. However, this alone cannot explain why the trajectory started from the
opposite side of the previous-trial stimulus. To empirically confirm that our results were not
driven by the rotation of the test object, we conducted a location delayed estimation experiment
(N = 18) in which participants directly clicked the remembered location without rotating the test
object and replicated the curved trajectory (Supplementary material).

Discussion
The main question the present study attempted to address was whether serial dependence is a
representational bias that occurs during the perception of a new stimulus or a decisional bias that
occurs during the post-perceptual decision processes. To answer this question, we scrutinized
decision-related dependent variables — response initiation time and response trajectory — that
have been overlooked in previous studies. In two orientation delayed estimation tasks, we found
that the response initiation time was slower (both in terms of the proportion of immediate
decision and the speed of decision) when the current stimulus was similar to the previous
stimulus and that the response trajectory for serial dependence started from the opposite side of
the previous stimulus in the orientation space and converged into the final response. Critically,
we found these decisional dynamics irrespective of the direction of the serial dependence. These
results provide converging evidence that both repulsive and attractive serial dependence are
driven by post-perceptual decision processes.
The finding that the increase in the duration of delay and the use of variable stimulus
locations completely reversed the direction of the serial dependence from repulsion (Experiment
1) to attraction (Experiment 2) is consistent with previous findings that serial dependence is
strongly influenced by uncertainty in the task (Cicchini et al., 2018; Gallagher & Benton, 2022;
Manassi et al., 2018; van Bergen & Jehee, 2019). Similarly, a recent study found that the
direction of serial dependence was “flipped” from repulsion to attraction when the uncertainty of
the stimulus representation was increased by an attention-demanding intervening task that
interrupted the maintenance of the stimulus information (Chen & Bae, 2024). Together with the
present findings that both repulsive and attractive serial dependence recruits decisional
dynamics, we argue that the reversal of serial dependence by the task uncertainty reflects the
shift in decision criterion, as proposed by Thurstonian framework (Thurstone, 1927). When the
stimulus uncertainty is low, the decision is biased to emphasize the difference between the
consecutive stimuli, leading to repulsive biases, whereas when the stimulus uncertainty is high,
the decision is biased to emphasize the similarity between the consecutive stimuli, leading to
attractive biases. In this vein, the large individual differences in serial dependence (Bae & Chen,
2024; Zhang & Alais, 2020) can be understood in terms of differences in decision criteria which
was determined by individual’s subjective uncertainty in a given task. Future research is
necessary to investigate this possibility.
While serial dependence is often characterized by the direction of the bias for small stimulus
differences (e.g., attractive or repulsive, positive or negative), the bias in the opposite direction
has been observed for large stimulus differences, albeit with a smaller magnitude (“peripheral
bump”) (Bae & Luck, 2019; Bliss et al., 2017; Fritsche et al., 2020; Pascucci et al., 2019;
Samaha et al., 2019). This was also evident in the present study irrespective of the direction of
the bias for small stimulus differences. These findings suggest that a single mechanism is not
sufficient to fully explain the entire pattern of serial dependence phenomenon. For example,
research proposed that repulsive serial dependence for small stimulus differences is driven by
low-level adaptation mechanism (Fritsche et al., 2020). However, it is difficult to explain how
al., 2019). It is possible that the attractive bias for large stimulus differences reflects adaptation
to the opposite end of the teardrop stimulus, which can lead to attractive bias toward the tip of
the teardrop. However, our response trajectory analysis demonstrated that decisional processes
underlie the attractive serial dependence for large stimulus differences. Therefore, we propose
that the bias reversal between small and large orientation differences is also driven by post-
perceptual decision that was made to avoid extreme stimulus differences (e.g., 180° difference)
(Bae & Luck, 2017). Future study should investigate this possibility.
In the present study, we discussed response initiation time (RTI) as a proxy for the speed of
decision-making for a new stimulus. However, decision might have started before the onset of
the response cue (i.e., during working memory maintenance) and have not been completed
during the RTI. Indeed, orientation reports were almost immediately executed right after the
onset of the response cue on a large proportion of trials (>80%) when the location for the
decision was known in advance (Experiment 1), indicating that the decision has been already
the true decision-making time. However, we emphasize that our conclusion that serial
dependence is driven by decisional processes is based not only on the RTI itself but also on the
differences in RTIs between small and large orientation differences in terms of the speed of
response initiation for immediate and delayed responses and their relative proportions. Any
computational models that assume serial dependence reflects distortions in the representation
itself cannot explain why response initiation was slower when the two consecutive stimuli were
similar unless they incorporate a decisional process that determines the speed of response
initiation.
While the main finding of the present study is that decisional dynamics underlie serial
dependence irrespective of the direction of the bias, we do not conclude that low-level adaptation
plays no role in serial dependence. In fact, such conclusions would be inconsistent with
neuroimaging studies that found that the prior stimulus induces adaptation-like effect during the
early stage of information processing (Fritsche et al., 2022; Sheehan & Serences, 2022). For
example, an fMRI decoding study by Sheehan & Sereness (2022) found that the decoded
stimulus information from early visual cortex exhibited repulsive biases despite the
corresponding behavior exhibited an attractive serial dependence. However, it remains to be seen
whether the repulsive serial dependence in behavior is a direct reflection of low-level adaptation.
Given the present finding that decisional dynamics were also associated with repulsive serial
dependence (see also, Bae & Chen 2024; Chen & Bae, 2024), we conclude that low-level
adaptation mechanism alone is not sufficient to fully account for the repulsive serial dependence
in behavior. An important direction for future research would be to investigate to what extent the
repulsive serial dependence is driven solely by the adaptation mechanism.
