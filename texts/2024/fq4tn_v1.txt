8 Abstract
9 An increasing number of countries are considering implementing domestic carbon taxes to
10 achieve the carbon-reduction targets set in the Paris Agreement. However, introducing such taxes
11 presents significant challenges for policymakers worldwide. Despite their effectiveness, carbon
12 taxes remain the least popular policy instrument. Furthermore, few studies focus on public support
13 for carbon taxation in low- and middle-income countries, a crucial area of research given the
14 global significance of their emissions. Therefore, we conducted a pre-registered full factorial
15 survey experiment involving more than 13,000 evaluations of policy designs in China, Germany,
16 India, and the UK to address the most prevalent barriers to the popularity of carbon taxes, as
17 discussed in academic research, policy analysis, and public discourse: perceived effectiveness,
18 average household costs, the types of revenue recycling schemes implemented, and the extent of
19 international cooperation. Our findings revealed striking differences in how the countries
20 responded to carbon tax policies. The key findings included the following: cost transparency
21 unexpectedly reduced support, whereas communicating the effectiveness of the policy increased
22 it; preferences for revenue recycling schemes varied significantly across the four countries,
23 highlighting the need for tailored approaches; and, surprisingly, international cooperation
24 increased support only in Germany, challenging assumptions about global climate policy. These
25 findings have profound implications for policymakers, suggesting that an effective carbon tax
26 design must be carefully calibrated in the national context. This study provides a roadmap for
27 designing carbon tax policies that are environmentally effective and politically viable for diverse
28 global economies.
29 Introduction
30 To meet the carbon reduction targets set in the Paris Agreement, a growing number of
31 countries are considering the introduction of domestic carbon taxes. These measures aim to
32 raise the cost of fossil fuels and the electricity generated from these sources, with the goal of
33 reducing their consumption. While carbon pricing is considered one of the most effective
2,3
34 strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, its adoption presents significant challenges
4,5
35 for decision-makers worldwide. Although carbon pricing has the potential to drive
36 environmental change, it often faces public opposition, as people fear its negative impacts on
6,7
37 the economy and perceive it as unfair. Despite its effectiveness, it remains the least popular
38 policy instrument, creating the need to explore the reasons. To ensure the political feasibility
39 of implementing carbon pricing, it is essential to assess and understand the strategies for
40 reducing public resistance. It is also important for policymakers engaged in climate change and
41 policy development to consider the costs and effectiveness of policy designs.
42 Recent research has proposed policies to enhance public acceptance of carbon pricing.
43 These policies include using fee-and-dividend models and earmarking tax revenue for essential
8,9
44 investments. However, there is a notable lack of research focusing on public attitudes towards
45 climate policy in low- and middle-income countries. China is currently the world’s largest
46 emitter of carbon dioxide (CO ) and India ranks third. Both countries face the dual challenge
47 of developing their economies while mitigating climate change to reduce global CO emissions.
48 The approach to carbon taxation and emission reductions in low- and middle-income countries
49 may differ from that in high-income countries because of varying development targets, climate
50 change adaptation needs, and historical emissions responsibilities. Therefore, it is necessary to
51 study a diverse set of countries with harmonised designs to explore the impact of their
52 characteristics on these global issues.
53 In public discussions, concerns about the fair distribution of the burden, both nationally
54 and internationally, the use of revenue, scepticism about environmental effectiveness, and the
10–12
55 costs of carbon taxes are the most prevalent. To address these concerns and barriers to the
56 acceptance of carbon taxation, we conducted a harmonised full factorial survey experiment in
57 China, Germany, India, and the UK, allowing us to leverage the benefits of the causal
58 interpretation of experiments and the generalisability of surveys. This approach allowed us to
59 address the most prevalent challenges to the popularity of carbon taxes, as discussed in
60 academic research, policy analysis, and public discourse. Given the full factorial design of our
61 survey experiment, we were able to analyse both the predicted impact of the evaluated policy
62 design and the relative importance of the policy dimensions for each country.
13–15
63 Most public opinion polls assess support for carbon taxation in general terms, for
64 example, by asking for general support for carbon taxation. However, few studies have
65 systematically explored the conditional nature of this support on the most significant aspects of
66 policy design. These studies often have limitations such as failing to thoroughly analyse how
67 different revenue recycling schemes can sustain support as tax levels rise, assess the impact of
68 costs, or measure policy effectiveness. They also tend to overlook global differences in the
69 implementation of carbon taxes. This highlights the need for more comprehensive studies that
70 adopt a holistic approach to carbon tax policies.
71 Previous studies have used conjoint analysis, typically with limited fractional factorial
72 designs. This restricts the number of comparisons between the dimensions and attributes of
73 interest. To address this limitation, we conducted a full factorial survey, which allowed us to
74 explore the full range of interactions between factors that determine effective policy designs,
75 while reducing some of the social desirability bias associated with conjoint analysis. Our
76 findings suggest that with careful policy design and communication of relevant information,
77 relatively unpopular policies can be made more attractive to the public, even at higher tax levels.
78 This study makes several key contributions to the literature on public support for carbon
79 taxation across four major economies: China, Germany, India, and the UK. First, it provides
80 novel insights into how differences in economic structure and existing policy approaches affect
81 public support for carbon taxation in diverse contexts. Second, using carefully designed survey
82 experiments, we assess public attitudes towards the introduction of carbon taxes at various
83 prices, with the amounts adjusted for purchasing power parity. Third, we systematically
84 investigate the redistributive mechanisms and revenue recycling schemes that could
85 meaningfully increase public support. Fourth, we test the impact of communicating the costs
86 and effectiveness of carbon taxes on shaping public attitudes. Finally, we examine how framing
87 carbon taxes as an internationally cooperative solution influences public support across national
88 contexts. Taken together, these findings provide valuable guidance for policymakers seeking to
89 design politically viable, publicly acceptable, and environmentally impactful carbon tax
90 policies.
91 Hypotheses development
92 People rarely oppose carbon taxation per se but rather its design and perceived
18,19
93 consequences. The extent to which people support climate policy instruments is influenced
94 by their perceived effectiveness, fairness, and costs. Leveraging these factors through the
95 communication of effectiveness, cost transparency, and fair policy design could make carbon
96 taxes more attractive to the broader public. Accordingly, we develop hypotheses on the
97 motivations for opposing or supporting carbon taxes. As these factors are manifold and include
98 many socio-psychological factors such as fairness considerations, perceived effectiveness in
99 mitigating climate change, and economic impact, we concentrate on the most prominent factors
100 from recent policy recommendations in the relevant literature and current political debates as
10,12,16
101 potential levers to support carbon taxation: types of revenue recycling schemes,
102 communication of policy effectiveness and costs, and international cooperation.
103 Environmental taxes serve as an incentive for individuals and businesses to engage in
104 environmentally friendly behaviours. Carbon pricing mechanisms such as carbon taxes are
105 often proposed for several reasons. They incentivise emission reductions and are
106 straightforward to implement and operate without requiring government fiscal resources.
107 Surveys usually find a negative correlation between higher taxes and public support for carbon
8,12,16
108 taxation.
109 H1: Public support for carbon taxation is lower at higher tax levels.
110 Because carbon taxes are regressive, people may worry that they will disproportionately burden
8,23,24
111 low-income households without appropriate counterbalancing measures. To address
112 concerns about tax burdens, policymakers should consider how revenue from carbon taxes may
113 benefit the public. One option is revenue recycling in which the revenue generated from carbon
114 taxation is returned to society. This generates additional direct and indirect benefits and
115 addresses one of the key challenges associated with the implementation of carbon taxation. This
116 approach is the most practical solution to gain sufficient public support for the implementation
8,11,25
117 of an effective carbon tax.
118 The selection of the specific revenue recycling schemes for this study (investments in
119 welfare, investments in climate adaptation, social cushioning, and lump-sum transfers) is based
120 on their prevalence in a combination of sources, public discussions, academic research, and
121 policy analysis (e.g. Carattini et al. ). Although the existing literature provides theoretical
122 arguments on the individual determinants of support for carbon taxation (such as those
123 presented by Carattini et al. ) and the general impact of revenue recycling (as discussed by
124 Beiser-McGrath et al. ), insufficient information is available on the variations in support for
125 specific types of revenue recycling in different countries.
126 We expect all revenue recycling schemes to increase support for carbon taxation, with
127 differences in countries’ preferences, particularly between the Global South and North. We also
128 expect revenue recycling schemes that return taxes directly to everyone as a lump sum and
129 social cushioning for low-income households to have the most positive impacts. Conversely,
130 investing carbon tax revenue in welfare and running climate adaptation programmes are
131 expected to have the least positive impacts. Finally, we expect a higher preference for
132 investments in climate adaptation in the Global South, which is already experiencing and is
133 expected to experience the consequences of ongoing climate change more severely than the
134 North.
135 A preference for revenue recycling can arise from a number of mechanisms, the main
136 one being a desire for fairness, but also for schemes that generate more tangible benefits and
137 impacts. The empirical literature has established that perceived fairness is an important
138 determinant of public support for carbon taxation. From this perspective, revenue recycling
139 schemes such as social cushioning are deemed fair. Lump-sum transfers are considered in line
140 with the equality dimension of the justice literature.
141 H2: Public support for carbon taxation is higher when a revenue recycling scheme is
142 specified.
143 Public opposition to carbon taxation may decrease over time because voter aversion usually
144 falls after a policy is implemented, as individuals become more accustomed to the measure and
12 26
145 can assess its benefits and costs more accurately. For example, Schuitema et al. conducted
146 a field study in Stockholm and found that the implementation of the congestion charge policy
147 led to increased acceptance, as individuals realised that the perceived costs of the charge were
148 lower than expected and did not outweigh the personal and social benefits. Caratini et al.
149 suggested that effective policy communication strategies entail educating individuals about
150 anticipated household expenditure to garner support. They argued that individuals frequently
151 lack the same level of knowledge as experts and that addressing this information gap through
152 communication would lead to increased support for policies. Thus, informing the public of the
153 expected costs of environmental taxes may increase their support. However, as demonstrated
154 by Douenne and Fabre in their study of the Yellow Vests movement (see Supplementary
155 Notes), making costs explicit may heighten people’s awareness of their personal financial
156 impact, leading to decreased support, especially among those with economic anxiety.
157 Additionally, drawing on prospect theory, highlighting the costs of carbon taxation may
158 trigger loss aversion, whereby people tend to be more sensitive to potential losses (in this case,
159 increased household expenses) than to potential gains (environmental benefits). This
160 psychological bias can result in reduced support for a policy when costs are made transparent.
161 Given this ambiguity, we propose the following hypothesis:
162 H3: Public support for carbon taxation is higher when information on the average cost
163 to households is provided.
164 Although the environmental economic literature expects beneficial environmental effects, the
165 general public does not always perceive carbon taxes as effective. The results obtained from
166 survey studies suggest that carbon taxes are not perceived as an effective means of discouraging
167 high carbon behaviour and that individuals often overestimate the costs of transitioning from
168 high- to low-carbon options. However, most studies have focused on the perceived
24 29
169 effectiveness of carbon taxes or lacked experimental setups. Recent studies have emphasised
170 the perceived ineffectiveness of carbon taxes on the environment as a major barrier to their
24 12
171 acceptability. Carattini et al. theorised that communicating the anticipated reduction in
172 greenhouse gas emissions resulting from a carbon tax could increase acceptance of the tax
173 before its implementation. Hence, it is necessary to provide experimentally varied estimates of
174 the effectiveness of specific carbon tax levels to respondents to gauge their support for carbon
175 taxation. Accordingly, we hypothesise the following:
176 H4: Public support for carbon taxation is higher when information on its effectiveness
177 is provided.
178 Solving global environmental problems depends on global cooperation, as evidenced by many
179 international environmental conventions that vary widely in scope and effectiveness. However,
180 the success of these efforts often depends on mutual participation and is threatened by a lack of
181 cooperation among key nations. Consequently, our final hypothesis concerns how individuals’
182 support for carbon taxation may depend on their perceived commitment to the equitable
183 implementation of such a tax globally.
184 A common concern among policymakers and in public discourse is that domestic
185 economies may be at a competitive disadvantage if other countries do not adopt similar carbon
186 taxes, which could undermine the equitable global effort that all nations seek to achieve in
187 principle. A caveat of many studies is that they make the (implicit) assumption that every
188 country will implement a carbon tax rate in a coordinated manner to achieve fairness, which is
189 unrealistic.
190 According to a recent study, individuals in the US may consider the actions of other
191 countries when forming their carbon tax preferences. However, it is uncertain whether this
192 applies to developing and emerging economies in the Global South, which directly face many
193 consequences of ongoing climate change. Carbon taxation has economic impacts distinct from
194 those of broader climate policies. As India and China have highlighted, the historical
195 responsibility of Western countries in relation to carbon emissions may indicate a greater
196 relevance of mitigating behaviour in high-income countries. This may lead to a greater
197 emphasis on international fairness in carbon tax preferences.
198 H5: Public support for CO taxes is higher when other countries implement comparable
199 taxes.

200 We conducted a pre-registered 2 ×3 ×5 full factorial design survey experiment with a
201 representative sample of 4664 from four major economies—Germany, the UK, India, and
202 China—to examine how the dimensions of fairness and the transparent communication of costs
203 and effectiveness causally affect support for carbon taxation, while also investigating the
204 generalisability of these empirical findings across national contexts. The respondents were
205 asked to evaluate three randomly assigned policy proposals, resulting in 13,992 observations.

225 We found that support for carbon taxes at $130 was the highest in India (M = 3.25), the
226 second highest in China (M = 2.79), low in the UK (M = 0.78), and the lowest in Germany (M

249 the specific policy design, thereby rejecting the null hypothesis in favour of H4. This effect was
250 particularly pronounced in China. Finally, informing the respondents about the average

286 on effectiveness, provided information on the expected cost, and lacked a revenue recycling

290 weakest.
292 Discussion
293 Carbon pricing is effective in reducing emissions but is politically challenging. Rising fuel
294 prices have spurred worldwide resistance to its implementation. Our study focused on people’s
295 preferences for carbon taxation in four major economies and carbon emitters from the Global
296 North and South: China, Germany, India, and the UK. To gain insights into public preferences
297 and identify the optimal policy strategies that simultaneously enhance climate change
298 mitigation and garner public support, we employed a full factorial survey experiment among
299 samples representative at the country level.
300 We found significant differences in support for carbon taxation across countries. On
301 average, people in China and India expressed higher support for carbon taxation than those in
302 the UK and Germany. This difference in support reflects the social cost of carbon in terms of
303 future vulnerability to climate change, underlining how different countries may face different
304 challenges and risks from climate change depending on their geographical, economic, and
305 social characteristics.
306 First, the results of our study support the hypothesis that revenue recycling increases
307 public support for carbon taxation. Although we found that all the proposed schemes increased
308 support for carbon taxation independently, we also identified clear differences in preferences
309 across the countries, challenging the generalisability of revenue recycling schemes on a global
310 scale. The respondents in Germany and China preferred per capita reimbursements, whereas
311 those in India preferred social cushioning. By contrast, the respondents in the UK strongly
312 favoured investments in the welfare system. It is beyond the scope of this study to examine the
313 mechanisms underlying the observed variation in support for these revenue recycling schemes
314 across the countries. Nevertheless, cultural differences, social costs, political ideologies,
315 economic structures, and historical responsibilities may have contributed to the observed
316 variance. The findings suggest that policy analysts and decision-makers should engage in public
317 discourse on the optimal utilisation of revenue derived from carbon taxation to enhance public
318 support. These findings suggest that although revenue recycling may be beneficial in terms of
319 building public support for carbon taxation, it is not a panacea, as suggested by previous studies.
320 Second, we tested the degree to which communicating the effectiveness of carbon
321 taxation could increase public support. We designed a survey experiment to inform respondents
322 about the carbon tax’s effectiveness using specific numbers, which is often lacking in similar
323 studies in the literature and political discourse. Policy opposition is often driven by information
324 asymmetry, where citizens lack the necessary information, and we addressed this gap by
325 convincing citizens that environmental effectiveness would increase support. We found
326 evidence supporting this hypothesis, with the effect being most pronounced in China.
327 Third, based on analogous theoretical considerations, it is frequently presumed that
328 disclosing the financial implications of policies can have a comparable impact, suggesting that
329 once individuals are made aware of the true costs of a design, it enhances their support. We
330 provided respondents with specific information about the tax’s financial implications, an
331 element often absent in similar experimental studies. However, we found that individuals were
332 less supportive when informed of the costs. This fact calls for a discussion of the
333 appropriateness of disclosing the cost implications for policymaking.
334 Fourth, previous studies have often assumed that all countries act in coordination and
335 adopt the same carbon tax (e.g. Carattini et al. ). However, this assumption may be unrealistic
336 given the differences in political consensus and economic development stages worldwide.
337 Given that China and India are among the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters, pricing
338 carbon emissions in these countries is pivotal for reducing emissions globally. We assessed the
339 relevance of global fairness in supporting domestic carbon taxation and noted that only in
340 Germany did the support respond to contributions and international cooperation with the EU,
341 the US, and China. A review of the empirical literature revealed that only one study tested
342 this hypothesis with German participants, corroborating our results. However, expanding the
343 scope beyond Germany, we found no significant effects in the UK, India, and China. Although
344 this surprising negative effect observed in China is beyond the scope of the study, further
345 investigation is warranted. In light of this, it seems that this factor is not as generalisable as
346 previously theorised, making it less relevant beyond Germany. Consequently, opposition to
347 carbon taxes did not appear to be driven by concerns about free-riding on climate change
348 mitigation as a form of global public good, which is consistent with the idea of collective action
20,32
349 in the commons. The results suggest that concerns about international free-riding are not a
350 significant factor shaping people’s policy preferences and support for carbon tax rates,
351 particularly in the Global South. In contrast to historical emissions from the West, highlighted
352 by India and China, these are not reflected in people’s political preferences.
353 Our findings revealed varying effect sizes across the tested hypotheses. Regarding
354 revenue recycling schemes (H2), the strongest significant effects were observed with per capita
355 reimbursements, showing particularly large effects in Germany and China. However, regarding
356 the provision of cost information (H3), a negative effect twice as strong was observed, with the
357 largest effect being observed in Germany. These differences in effect sizes suggest that
358 policymakers, particularly in Germany and China, can achieve the greatest gains in public
359 support by focusing on revenue recycling schemes. Further, communicating the effectiveness
360 of the policy was observed to have an effect size close to that of revenue recycling schemes,
361 which did not fully offset the negative effect of cost transparency. The smaller effect sizes for
362 international cooperation (H5) suggest that this factor may be less crucial for designing carbon
364 Policymakers should carefully consider and address the negative impact of cost transparency
365 on public support for a carbon tax. To design more effective and publicly acceptable policies,
366 they should thus focus on communicating the benefits and effectiveness of carbon taxes, while
367 developing targeted strategies to mitigate or offset the perceived financial burden on
368 households.
369 Our study aimed to ascertain whether a combination of the most theoretically and
370 publicly discussed policy elements could lead to support for one of the most unpopular but most
371 effective policies. Our study contributes to the small body of research that examines attitudes
372 towards climate policy instruments in the Global South. As signatories to the Paris Agreement,
373 these countries face the challenge of reducing their emissions. Therefore, information on the
374 attitudes and factors that shape them in contexts beyond the Global North is urgently required.
375 Our findings have significant policy implications. Although revenue recycling may
376 increase support, the most popular schemes are contingent on the national context. This
377 reinforces the need for country-specific empirical investigations to determine the public’s
378 preferred options for revenue recycling before making policy decisions. Although this task
379 remains challenging, we demonstrated that with appropriately designed policy instruments, it
380 is possible to achieve support for even higher carbon tax levels. Ultimately, the two most
381 important factors driving support for carbon taxation are trust in the government and concerns
382 about climate change. Therefore, environmental policy should first focus on strengthening these
383 two key determinants, while optimising policy designs to make carbon taxes more feasible.
384 The findings of this study suggest that policy designs commonly favoured in
385 environmental policy but often opposed by the general public may prove more effective in
386 garnering public acceptance when policy elements pertaining to revenue recycling schemes,
387 effectiveness, and cost as well as communication strategies tailored to the country context are
388 carefully considered. These findings can inform the development of effective carbon taxes that
389 citizens accept at levels likely to induce significant emission reductions, as they address revenue
390 recycling transparently and communicate its effectiveness. Addressing the general public’s
391 concerns is crucial for avoiding resistance to effective climate change mitigation policies.
392 Further research is required to determine the most effective combinations of policy
393 instruments, including carbon taxes, subsidies for renewable energy, green technology, and
394 regulations. Future research should also consider socio-transformative aspects such as
395 programmes to address potential job losses in the post-fossil fuel era to develop and implement
396 policies that can generate additional support for mitigation policies. Furthermore, as indicated
397 previously, social costs appear to align with support for carbon taxation. This suggests that
398 countries such as China and India, which are predicted to be more adversely affected by climate
399 change, also show higher support for carbon taxation. Future research could consider the
400 social cost of carbon by providing respondents with this information to increase support. In
401 addition, we addressed the vertical distribution effects of carbon taxation using the revenue
402 recycling schemes of lump-sum transfers and social cushioning. However, horizontal
403 distribution effects remain and must be addressed in terms of fairness because different
404 circumstances can burden households with similar characteristics differently. Therefore, further
405 research is required to address this gap. Furthermore, it is important to consider that the role of
406 trust in the government and environmental concerns as well as the extent to which citizens
407 prefer market instruments such as carbon taxes and subsidies over conventional regulatory
408 instruments may vary depending on the characteristics of political and economic systems and
409 cultural contexts. For example, the preference for market instruments may be greater in
410 countries with a more market-oriented approach to environmental policies.
411 Although this study was conducted in countries with large populations, the overall
412 number of countries was small. Extending the sample to other countries using representative
413 samples could reveal potentially important nuances.
414 Whether broad support for carbon taxation is a sufficient condition for adoption cannot
415 be addressed using this design. Nevertheless, this study suggests considerable scope for
416 designing a carbon tax policy that is not only popular with the general public but also benefits
417 them directly and indirectly.
419 Methods
420 A multi-country online survey experiment was conducted in four countries using the
421 Qualtrics platform. Our sample was based on nationally representative samples from Germany,
422 the UK, India, and China, all of which are major economies and high CO emitters.
2 2
423 We used a 2 ×3 ×5 full factorial design to create vignettes and policy proposals by
424 combining all possible attribute combinations. More than 4,000 respondents evaluated three
425 randomly selected vignettes from a full factorial survey, resulting in more than 12,000 assessed
426 vignettes. The study employed a full factorial design with hypotheses pre-registered in the OSF
427 Registries prior to data collection.
428 The respondents were randomly assigned and provided with information on the
429 anticipated impact of carbon taxation on emission reductions or the associated cost as a
430 percentage of average household income, or both, based on calculations from Kaestner and
431 Sommer. To make tax levels internationally comparable in terms of cost and burden on the
432 average household, 2022 purchasing power parities were employed to convert them into
433 national currencies. In addition, we experimentally varied the information on average
434 consumption-based CO emissions per capita in each country to test whether this affected
435 support for carbon pricing and provide additional guidance on the costs of taxes.
437 Analytical Strategy
438 We used hierarchical linear modelling to account for the nested structure of our data, which
439 included both respondent- and country-level variations. We estimated random intercepts for
441 sample of all four countries was used to test the hypotheses. In accordance with the pre-
442 registration, the threshold of P < 0.05 was applied to identify significant effect sizes. The P
443 values for H1, H3, and H5 referred to one-tailed t-tests, whereas those for H2 and H4 referred
444 to two-tailed t-tests, as per the pre-registered test choices. We modelled predictions of support
445 for carbon taxation (on a scale from -5 to 5) using a four-way interaction between tax levels
446 and vignette dimensions (revenue recycling schemes, costs, and effectiveness), allowing us to
447 examine how these factors jointly influenced public support for carbon tax policies. The two-
448 way interaction effects for the vignette dimensions are shown in Supplementary Figures 1–5.
449 We used a machine learning approach with the XGBoost algorithm to assess the importance of
450 each dimension in the full factorial survey experiment in the presence of non-linearities and
451 complex dependencies within the data. The R package lmer was used to estimate the cluster-
40 41
452 robust models, xgboost for the machine learning model, ggeffects for the predicted values,
42 43 44 45 46
453 and ggplot2, modelsummary, patchwork, ggrepel, and shapviz for presentation.
455 Sample
456 The samples were selected based on the quota criteria. The study included individuals based on
457 their demographic background characteristics such as sex, age, region, and census data from
458 each country to obtain a nationally representative sample of these sociodemographic
459 dimensions. The participants were randomly assigned to different policy proposals (treatments)
460 without prior knowledge of their group assignments. In addition, they were asked about their
461 sex, age, education, annual household income, dwelling & heating type, social justice attitudes,
462 and climate concerns.
464 Data Collection
465 Qualtrics’ proprietary panels and sampling technology were used to collect the data. The
466 sampling software controlled the flow of the participants into each survey based on quotas,
467 according to the population census. Panellists were invited via email and the survey was
468 accessed through a provided link.
469 Qualtrics supervised the panel and continuously monitored its quality using a scoring
470 and monitoring process. The criteria were established to exclude those participants who
471 dropped out during the survey, rushed through it, or provided straight-line responses. Informed
472 consent was obtained from all the study participants in accordance with ethical regulations and
473 guidelines, and compliance with the Institutional Review Board of the University of
474 Luxembourg was ensured (reference number: ERP 23-095 ECO2TAP).
475 The phrasing of the experimental interventions and outcome variables is provided in
476 Supplementary Notes 1 and 2.
478 Policy Proposal Number: 25
479 One policy option of the UK government to reduce CO emissions is the introduction
480 of a CO tax of £48 per ton. This political measure will lead to a 1.15% increase in
481 average household costs per year. This CO tax will likely reduce CO emissions in
2 2
482 the UK by 10%. The CO tax revenue will be used to increase investments in climate
483 change adaptation measures (e.g. flood and fire protection). This political measure will
484 only come into effect if the European Union and United States collaborate and
485 introduce similar CO taxes. To what extent do you support or oppose this?
