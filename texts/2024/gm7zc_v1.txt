BELIEFS AND EXPLORATION 1
Abstract
We argue that one reason why people consider others’ ideological beliefs (i.e.,
progressive vs. conservative) is that people profit by predicting others’ exploration behavior
from their beliefs. Eight experiments confirmed that people more readily invested in
progressives when switching to novel options (i.e., exploration) was more profitable than
staying with valuable resources (i.e., exploitation). In contrast, people more readily invested
in conservatives when exploitation was more profitable than exploration. Thus, considering
others’ beliefs may be one means to navigate ecologies with different reward structures, a task
that has remained relevant throughout human history and across cultures.
Keywords: ideological beliefs; exploitation; exploration; investment

Ideological beliefs as cues to exploitation-exploration behavior
Learning others’ ideological beliefs is useful for navigating the social environment.
For example, people accurately predict that others will cooperative when the others’ beliefs
align with their own beliefs (Koch, Dorrough, et al., 2020; Roberts & Koch, 2025). Here, we
investigate another function. Learning others’ beliefs (Imhoff et al., 2018; Koch et al., 2018)
may help predicting their performance at exploiting versus exploring. Exploiting means
staying with valuable options. People exploit when they settle for their decent job, order their
favorite meal, or catch up with their best friend. Exploring means switching to novel options.
People explore when they change careers, sample exotic cuisine, or chat with strangers
(Mehlhorn et al., 2015). In some contexts, exploitation is more rewarding (e.g., abundant and
cultivable environments); at other times, exploration is the superior and prevalent behavior
(e.g., scarce and depleting ecologies; Harris et al., 2021; Hotaling et al., 2021).
Conservatives value conformity and tradition (Schwartz et al., 2012), follow routines
(Carney et al., 2008; Sibley et al., 2012), and seek closure and certainty (Jost et al., 2003;
Ruisch & Stern, 2021). In contrast, progressives value autonomy and diversity, are open to
new experiences, embrace change, and tolerate ambiguity (Jost, 2017). Accordingly, people
hold stereotypes about the thinking, feelings, and goals of conservatives, compared to
progressives (Graham et al., 2012; Neel & Lasseter, 2019; Scherer et al., 2015). For example,
conservatives seem more rigid, pessimistic, and collectivistic. Our research contributes the
related behavioral stereotype that conservatives stay/exploit, whereas progressives
switch/explore.
Why should conservatives (vs. progressives) be linked to stay/exploit (vs.
switch/explore) behavior? Because their actual personality differences (e.g., Jost, 2017)
suggest the behavior, and because conservatives actually stay/exploit more than progressives
(i.e., ideology is a valid cue for the behavior; Shook & Fazio, 2009), which people should
BELIEFS AND EXPLORATION 3
learn over time. Another reason is semantic: conservation literally entails to maintain
something, and progress literally requires to change something.
Why should people monitor others’ ideology and stay/exploit (vs. switch/explore)
behavior? Our studies suggest that this helps the perceiver to manage affordances in their
social environment (Neuberg et al., 2020). Investing in others and delegating to them pays off
only if they succeed. Success requires stay/exploit behavior in some tasks, and switch/explore
behavior in other tasks (Mehlhorn et al., 2015). Thus, people may consider others’ ideology
and stay/exploit versus switch/explore behavior to predict who succeeds in which task, and to
co-benefit from this foreseeable success through investing and delegating accordingly.
The present research
In eight experiments (N = 1,491), participants learned which of two behaviors is more
rewarding in a task. When they learned that exploration (vs. exploitation) is superior, they
predicted and bet that progressive others would perform better in the task. Besides, they were
more willing to delegate the task to progressives. When they learned that exploitation (vs.
exploration) is superior, they predicted and bet that conservative others would perform better
and were more willing to delegate the task to conservatives. Thus, the central finding is that
participants’ betting decisions and delegation behavior was an interaction of the task’s
reward structure and the perceived beliefs of others.
Open science. We report all conditions, measures, and exclusions in all experiments.
We pre-registered no experiment. All experiments’ materials, data, code, and results are
available in the supplement and on the OSF website (link).
Statistical power. We used the R package simr (Green & MacLeod, 2016) to run
100 simulations-based power analyses for the central effect in Experiments 1-6, namely the
interaction between rewarding behavior and the perceived beliefs of others. For confirming
(α = .05) an unstandardized effect size of b = 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04, our power was M =
1-β
0.57, 0.84, and 0.96 across Experiments 1-6, respectively (the supplement shows each
BELIEFS AND EXPLORATION 4
experiment’s power). Overall, the observed unstandardized effect size was M = .037. In
Experiments 7 and 8, both independent variables were categorical, and thus we used
Westfall’s (2015) PANGEA application to estimate our power for confirming (α = .05) the
central interaction effect (Cohen’s d = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) when recruiting 400 participants. Our
power was 1-β = 0.85, 1, and 1, respectively.
Experiments 1-3
Participants delegated playing a rewarding game to members of societal groups. We
predicted that they would be more willing to delegate to members of progressive groups if
they had learned that exploration (vs. exploitation) behavior is more rewarding in the game.
And they would be more willing to delegate to members of conservative groups if they had
learned that exploitation (vs. exploration) behavior is more rewarding.
We report the results of all three experiments but relegate the methods of the first two
to the supplement. Only in the third experiment, participants did not rate the group members’
dispositions to show exploitation versus exploration behavior before delegating the game
to them. Thus, the third experiment tested our hypotheses more thoroughly because we
primed exploit-explore stereotypes about the group members to a lesser extent.
Methods
Participants. 80, 89, and 86 students at a large European university (166 women,
87 men, and two other; M = 22.22) took part in Experiments 1-3.
age
Procedure. Each experiment started with the same manipulation of exploitation or
exploration as the rewarding behavior. In a card game, participants were forced to draw
10 cards (wins or blanks) from a standard deck, to learn its win rate. Then, they were free to
draw 40 more cards from either the standard deck or four option decks. Participants’ task was
to maximize number of wins. Two counters kept track of the number of drawn cards and
study people’s exploitation-exploration behavior (e.g., Hotaling et al., 2021).
BELIEFS AND EXPLORATION 5
In the exploitation condition (coded as -5), the standard deck’s win rate, p = .8, was
high and higher than the win rates of option decks 1-4, p = .2, .2, .5, and .5 in random order.
This condition taught to maximize reward by staying with the valuable standard deck (i.e.,
exploitation). In the exploration condition (coded as 5), the standard deck’s win rate, p = .5,
was moderate and lower than the win rate of one option deck, p = .2, .2, .5, and .8 in
random order. This condition taught to maximize reward by switching to, and between, the
novel option decks, to find one with a higher win rate (i.e., exploration).
In the exploitation conditions of Experiments 1-3, 93%, 94%, and 93% of the
participants correctly identified the deck with the highest win rate at the end of the game, and
55%, 68%, and 71% in the exploration conditions, respectively.

Note. Example of having drawn 10 wins (translated: “current score: 10 wins“) and drawing
card 14 of 50 (translated: “current trial: 14 of 50“). The cursor hovers over option deck 2.
After playing the card game, the procedure of Experiments 1-3 started to differ. The
supplement details Experiments 1 and 2, which were precursors to Experiment 3. Only in
Experiments 1 and 2, participants used a slider (ranging from stays with the standard deck
BELIEFS AND EXPLORATION 6
[coded as 0] to switches to the option decks 1-4 [coded as 10]) to convey their stereotypes
about others’ tendency to show exploration (vs. exploration) behavior in the game. They
stereotyped these others right after playing the card game (i.e., after learning whether
exploitation or exploration behavior was more rewarding in the game) but before rating the
others’ suitability to play the game in their stead. The others in Experiment 1 only included
members of conservative and progressive groups. The others in Experiment 2 also included
members of low- and high-agency groups.
In Experiment 3, participants imagined to select a person who would play the game in
their stead and earn a reward for both the delegator and delegate. To guide their selection, we
reminded the participants that people differ in their tendency to stay with the standard deck
(i.e., exploitation) or switch to the option decks 1-4 (i.e., exploration), and they should select
the person whose tendency would maximize game performance. Below, 32 candidate persons
appeared one below another in random order. We described each candidate with one
group membership. The candidates included eight conservative groups (senior, retiree,
Muslim, Jew, rural person, conservative person, religious person, Catholic) and eight
progressive groups (atheist, musician, teenager, hippie, urban person, artist, vegan, and nerd).
To blur this difference in beliefs, the candidates also included members of low- and high-
agency groups (eight each): homeless person, alcoholic, welfare recipient, unemployed
person, poor person, criminal, lower class person, and sick person versus doctor, celebrity,
upper class person, soccer player, rich person, educated person, employer, and athlete.
of the groups. We looked up the mean ratings in Study 3 in Koch and colleagues (2016), and
they ranged from 0 to 100. Their pattern shows that we effectively manipulated perceived
beliefs of others and perceived agency of others. We rescaled the mean ratings so that they
ranged from -5 (conservative) to 5 (progressive), and from -5 (low agency) to 5 (high agency).

Exp. 3: Measure of Delegation to Members of Groups whose Ideological Beliefs are Seen as
Conservative or Progressive, and whose Agency/Socioeconomic Success Seem Low or High
Results and discussion
Recall that we manipulated if the rewarding behavior was exploitation (staying with
the standard deck, coded as -5) or exploration (switching to option decks 1-4, coded as 5), and
we manipulated perceived beliefs of others and agency of others (Experiments 2 and 3)
though pre-existing mean ratings for group members’ progressive beliefs and agency
(rescaled to range from -5 to 5). We measured investment in others through participants’
ratings for the group members’ suitability (coded as 0-10) to play the game in their stead, and
we measured stereotypes about others through ratings for the group members’ tendency to
show exploration rather than exploitation behavior in the game (coded as 0-10).

but also by their perceived communality, age, and gender.
Methods
Participants. 87, 97, and 116 students at a large European university (168 women,
127 men, four other, and one missing data; M = 22.32) took part in Experiments 4-6.
age
Procedure. Each experiment started with the same card game manipulation of
rewarding behavior that we had used in Experiments 1-3. In the exploitation conditions of
Experiments 4-6, 56%, 46%, and 72% of the participants correctly identified the deck with the
highest win rate at the end of the game, and 64%, 84%, and 60% in the exploration
conditions, respectively.
Next, we reminded the participants that people differ in their tendency to stay with the
standard deck (i.e., exploitation) or switch to the option decks 1-4 (i.e., exploration). We
conveyed that they would encounter the profiles of 96 other game players, and for each player
the participants would decide between raking in 5 points and betting for 10 points that the
player’s game performance was above-median (coded as 1) or below-median (coded as 0). In
each bet, they would win 10 points (vs. no points) when predicting (vs. mispredicting) the
respective player’s game performance. We told the participants to win as many points
as possible, and that they would learn their points at the experiment’s end. In the exploitation
(vs. exploration) condition, our instructions ended with disclosing that the deck with the
highest win rate was the standard deck (vs. one of the option decks 1-4).
Player 1’s profile showed their age, gender, agency (0 = powerless, low status,
dominated, and poor, 100 = powerful, high status, dominating, and wealthy), beliefs
BELIEFS AND EXPLORATION 13
(0 = traditional, religious, conventional, and conservative, 100 = modern, atheist, alternative,
and liberal), and communality (0 = dishonest, untrustworthy, threatening, and cold,
100 = sincere, trustworthy, benevolent, and warm). Based on these five cues, participants
Participants made the same decision for players 2-96.

Note. Example of examining player / person 1 and deciding between (translated) “rake in
5 points”, “bet for 10 points: person 1 performed above average in the card game”, and
“bet for 10 points: person 1 performed below average in the card game.”
The 96 players were real persons, namely 2 * 96 = 192 U.S. residents recruited
through Mechanical Turk (92 women, 99 men, and 1 other; M = 37.57) who had played
age
the game in the exploitation or exploration condition and rated the age, gender (1 = male,
2 = female), and the agency, beliefs, and communality of the self.
In the exploitation condition, the five cues correlated rs <= |.34|, and their dispersions were
95% CI = [35, 40] (age), [1.37, 1.59] (gender), [50, 58] (agency), [54, 64] (beliefs), and
[73, 79] (communality). In the exploration condition, the five cues correlated rs <= |.31|, and
BELIEFS AND EXPLORATION 14
Finally, participants rated in random order the validity of the three stereotype cues
(0 = not at all, 100 = very), and their reliance on these cues (0 = not at all, 100 = very). Also,
the participants provided the same demographic information as in Experiments 1-3.
Experiment 5 was a replication of Experiment 4.
In Experiment 6, the 96 players / profiles were made-up. Importantly, the participants
in Experiment 6 decided between raking in €0.03 and betting for €0.06 that the respective
player had performed below-median (coded as 0) or above-median (coded as 1) in the game.
Participant’s task was to maximize number of cents, and they received what they had earned
at the end of the experiment. Thus, Experiment 6 (vs. 4 and 5) raised the stakes.
Results and discussion
Recall that we manipulated if the rewarding behavior was exploitation (staying with
the standard deck, coded as -5) or exploration (switching to the option decks 1-4, coded as 5),
and we manipulated perceived beliefs, agency, and communality of others through
profile cues. After rescaling, these three independent variables ranged from -5 to 5. We
measured investments in others through participants’ 96 bets that the 96 players behind the
profiles had performed below median (36% of decisions, coded as 0) or above median
(36% of decisions, coded as 1) in the game. The remaining 28% of decisions were refusals to
make either bet, excluded from the below analyses.
Logistic mixed models predicted investments in others from rewarding behavior and
perceived beliefs, agency, and communality. The models also included interaction effects
between rewarding behavior on the one hand, and the perceived agency, beliefs, and
communality on the other hand. The models included random intercepts for the participants

to an imagined but more realistic organizational context.
Methods
Participants. In Experiments 7 and 8, we recruited 402 and 435 U.S. residents
through the platform Prolific Academic, respectively (422 women, 408 men, six other, and
one prefer not to say; M = 46.15).

Procedure. In Experiment 7’s exploitation rewarding condition (coded as -5),
participants imagined to be a manager who wants to delegate a task to an employee who
exploits standard solutions / who sticks with the status quo. Below, they indicated their
willingness to delegate to six employees shown in random order. They used a 7-point scale
that ranged from not at all (coded as 0) to extremely (coded as 6), and we portrayed three
employees as conservative, traditional, and conventional (all coded as -5), and three other
employees as liberal, modern, and alternative (all coded as 5). In the exploration rewarding
BELIEFS AND EXPLORATION 17
condition (coded as 5), participants imagined wanting to delegate to an employee who
explores innovative solutions / who thinks outside of the box. We manipulated the
rewarding behavior within-subjects and in random order. In Experiment 8, there were six
additional employees that we described as educated, uneducated, intelligent, unintelligent,
focusing on getting rewards, and focusing on preventing mistakes. We coded the beliefs of all
additional employees as 0 (i.e., neither conservative, nor progressive). We coded the
education of the educated and uneducated employee as 5 and -5, respectively, and 0 for the
ten other employees. And so on and so forth for the intelligence and promotion focus of the
twelve employees. At the end, the participants provided demographic information.

investment in (i.e., delegation to) progressives grew significantly larger when they had
learned that exploration (exploitation) is more rewarding. Participants’ investment in
conservatives grew significantly larger when they had learned that exploitation trumps
exploration.

General Discussion
The results from eight experiments showed that people more readily invested in
conservatives when exploitation was a more rewarding behavior than exploration, and they
invested more in progressives when exploration was superior to exploitation. This interaction
was robust. It emerged when people invested by delegating to others (Experiments 1-3, 7 and
8) versus by betting on others’ success (Experiments 4-6). It emerged when people invested in
others who differed in their beliefs (Experiments 1 and 7) versus beliefs and agency
(Experiments 2 and 3) versus beliefs, agency, communality, age, and gender
(Experiments 4-6) versus beliefs, education, intelligence, and promotion focus (Experiment
8). It emerged when people predicted others’ exploit-explore tendencies before investing in
them (Experiments 1 and 2) versus invested right away (Experiments 3-8). It emerged when
people invested in others whose beliefs differed more than their agency and communality
(Experiments 1, 4, and 5) versus as much as their agency and communality (Experiments 2, 3,
and 6). And it emerged when people invested real bonus money and realistic organizational
trust in others (Experiments 6-8) versus points of symbolic value (Experiments 1-5).
We did not define exploitation as making possibly rewarding choices without reward
feedback, and exploration as forgoing possibly rewarding choices in exchange for reward
feedback. These definitions disentangle reward from information and are common in the
literature (Hills et al., 2015; Mehlhorn et al., 2015). It remains to be shown that investors
predict from investees’ beliefs their performance in dilemmas that pit exploitation as reward
seeking against exploration as information seeking (e.g., Navarro et al., 2016). Another
noteworthy limitation is that Experiments 1-8 found effects other than the predicted
interaction effect between the perceived beliefs of others and rewarding behavior. People
readily invested in agentic, intelligent, and educated others (vs. their negative counterparts;
Koch et al., 2021; 2024) regardless of whether their task rewarded exploitation or exploration,

see Tables 2, 4, and 6. Thus, perceived beliefs of others independently but not solely
explained people’s investments in others’ performance in exploitation-exploration dilemmas.
To conclude, people spontaneously perceive others’ beliefs (Koch et al., 2020;
Nicolas et al., 2022), and one reason why they consider their (progressive vs. conservative)
beliefs is to predict their performance in exploitation (vs. exploration) and thus navigate
ecologies with different reward structures.
