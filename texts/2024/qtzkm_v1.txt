Abstract: This article systematically explores the existence of our world, the evolution
laws of all things in nature, and analyzes the emergence process and principles of
various phenomena. Firstly, this article discusses the existence phenomena of
ontology, entity, and subject, and provides conceptual definitions. Subsequently, this
article analyzed various self-organizing phenomena in the evolution process of entities,
explored how everything evolved from its basic structure, and analyzed and
summarized the forms and laws of evolution at each stage. Meanwhile, this article
explores how intelligence and consciousness emerge during the evolution process, as
well as the development trend of intelligent communities. This article provides a
systematic exploration and analysis of the evolution process of all things in nature,
which has practical significance for promoting philosophical research on the essence
of the world for humanity.

I. The theory of existence
1. Ontology
The definition of ontology: Ontology refers to the eternal, definite, and unique
ultimate existence that encompasses all things existing in the spatial and temporal
dimensions.
The Infinity of Ontology: Ontology has infinity, encompassing all possible existences
and variations.
Evolutionary nature of ontology: The internal elements of ontology can form different
forms, and its internal structure can undergo complex changes in the time dimension.
2. Entity theory
Definition of entity: An entity is a structure of continuous differences in different
dimensions of a large spatiotemporal ontology.
The existence of entities: The essence of the existence of entities lies in their
differences. Differentiation is a manifestation of the concept of existence, without
differences there is no existence.
Interactivity of entities: The relationship between entities and systems is continuous,
and the form of entities and the form of the relationship between systems have a
mutual influence, which is called basic interaction.
Subjectivity of Entity: The existence of an entity is equivalent to the existence of its
subject. The essence of subject existence lies in its interactivity, and the form of
subject existence is the content of its subject perspective, that is, its subjective
content.
3. Subjectivity theory
The definition of subject perspective: In an infinite dimensional ontology system, each
entity has a specific subject perspective, and the content changes of this perspective
correspond to the changes in the entity structure.
Subjectivity of the subjective perspective: The changes in the content of the
subjective perspective map to external changes, and are manifested as subjective
experiences in the subjective perspective of conscious subjects.
The authenticity of the subject perspectivee: The subject perspectivee is the only real
existence perceived by the entity. The content of the subjective perspective is
different from the objective perspective of the third party, which is an abstract
simulation of the entity, while the former is the only real existence that the entity can
sense.
II. Theory of Evolution
The evolution process of entities: from basic interactions to mirror universe systems.
The evolution mechanism of entities: The evolution process of entities is a continuous
development process, which extends from basic interactions to super intelligent
agents, and each stage is a natural extension of the previous stage. The characteristics
and driving mechanisms of each stage determine the possibility and direction of its
evolution towards higher stages.
The evolutionary characteristics of entities: The evolutionary characteristics of entities
lie in the improvement of adaptability. The essence of self evolving change is the
continuous evolution and development of highly adaptive negative feedback
structures under natural competition, with the direction of simulating the complexity
of natural changes and preparing as early as possible to cope with changes.
Stage 1: Natural Basic Material Evolution Process: Basic Interactions Evolve to Form
Self Organizing Material Structures
Entity structure: Basic material structure
Entity phenomena: forming complex vibration systems from micro to macro scales.
Evolutionary mechanism: The fundamental interactions determined by the
characteristics of the spatiotemporal field.
Driving principle: Natural basic interactions drive entity combinations through
spatiotemporal field characteristics to form more complex systems.
The form of Self-organizing
Self expanding form: The basic material structure is based on spontaneous attraction
and repulsion, and continuously expands its own structure spontaneously.
Self replication form: The self expanding material structure achieves self replication
and structural expansion through spontaneous attraction and repulsion.
Stage 2: Adaptive structure evolution process: self-organizing evolution forms an
adaptive structure
Entity structure: Single cell self-organizing structure
Entity phenomena: adaptive, relying on multi steady state structure and negative
feedback regulation.
Evolutionary mechanism: The composite physical effects of the profit seeking and
harm avoiding characteristics of composite structures are more conducive to survival.
Driving principle: Single cell self-organizing structures achieve self adaptation and self
maintenance through a complex physical effect of seeking benefits and avoiding harm.
The form of Adaptive
The sensing form of an entity: If an entity can perceive the interaction input of the
environmental system, match multiple types of internal structures, and output
interactions, then this entity is an independent sensing entity structure.
Adaptive form of entity: If the sensing mode of an independent sensing entity
structure can maintain its structural stability and continuity, then it is an adaptive
system.
The self-organizing form of entities: If an adaptive system can continuously evolve
towards a specific form direction, it is considered a self-organizing system with formal
goals.
Stage 3: Natural Training Collaborative Structure Evolution Process: Adaptive
Structure Collaborative Feedback Experience Evolution to Form Intelligent System
Entity structure: Multi cell collaborative aggregation intelligent agent
Entity phenomena: Cell aggregation, collaborative feedback of individual cell
aggregation, forming a unified overall feedback intelligent system.
Evolutionary mechanism: Natural training of multi cell combination structures to form
experience is beneficial for survival.
Driving principle: Multi cell collaborative aggregates form an experience driven unified
collaborative feedback mechanism through natural training.
The form of Intelligent
The intelligent form of entities: A self-organizing system with goals can be considered
an intelligent system if it has the ability to understand and transform the environment.
The universal intelligent form of entities: If an intelligent system has the ability to
understand and transform knowledge through free association, it can be regarded as a
universal intelligent system.
Stage 4: Consciousness Unified Subjective Evolution Process: Cell Network Evolution
Forming Consciousness Attention Unified Subjective Content Pattern System
Entity structure: cellular network subject perspective, unified consciousness,
intelligent agent
Entity phenomena: Consciousness feedback system, where the cellular network forms
a unified consciousness feedback system through the mechanism of conscious
attention.
Evolutionary mechanism: The attention mechanism in the consciousness neural
network is associated with sensing emotions, memory experiences, and forming a
holistic response that is beneficial for survival.
Driving principle: External changes form the maximum emotional drive for overall
response through attention mechanism and form a memory cycle iteration.
The form of consciousness
The definition of consciousness: Consciousness is the change in content that occurs
from the perspective of the subject. Consciousness generally refers to the conscious
state of animals that can be directly perceived. In animals with explicit consciousness,
the content changes of the neural network entities on which explicit consciousness
relies from the perspective of subjectivity are the explicit consciousness itself. This
neural network can not only recognize the characteristics of external changes, but
also simulate the things that affect it from a subjective perspective.
The mechanism of consciousness
The operation process of consciousness: The consciousness neural network unifies
various reflex arc neural networks to form a unified maximum reflex direction
response to external changes. The attention model in the consciousness neural
network selects the most activated sensory network, the experiential memory model
predicts changes experienced based on emotional mapping memory, the conceptual
understanding model actively predicts unknown changes, the regularity model has the
best judgment of comparative experience, the principle system model has systematic
causal logic, and the panoramic reflection framework has self referential and
consistent completeness.
The Value of Consciousness
The individual value of consciousness: Consciousness is not just a passive response to
current stimuli, but an active and predictive system that can use past experiences to
predict and adapt to future changes. This integrated consciousness model helps
individuals make more effective decisions and behavioral responses in complex and
changing environments.
Consciousness attention forms unified feedback: The attention mechanism selects the
strongest signal from numerous sensory inputs as the content of consciousness,
ensuring the consistency and uniqueness of the content, that is, at any given moment,
there is only one dominant feeling or thought in consciousness. The unity of this
overall feeling helps to coordinate individual responses to stimuli, making the overall
response more unified and effective.
Maximum overall emotional evaluation: The process of emotional evaluation forms an
individual's motivation and behavior by identifying the strongest emotional reactions.
The synthesis of this maximum emotion helps to limit the interference of weaker
sensations, avoid conflicts in pheromone secretion, and thus unify to form the
strongest emotional drive, guiding the overall behavior of individuals.
The overall feedback experience memory function of consciousness: Changes in
consciousness content generate experiences, which further form emotional
experience memory. These memories are crucial for predicting subsequent reactions,
as they allow individuals to predict possible future changes based on past experiences
and make decisions with the highest probability of being correct, in order to achieve a
win-win situation.
The function of the consciousness understanding model: The consciousness
understanding model predicts the most probable correct response by analyzing the
changes that have not been experienced as a whole. This model actively utilizes
empirical memory to determine the importance of new situations and makes
maximum probability predictions based on overall sensory analysis, in order to achieve
maximum benefit avoidance.
Stage 5: Consciousness Individual Collaborative Collective Knowledge Evolution
Process: Individual Survival Collaborative Evolution Forming a Knowledge
Collaborative Community System
Entity structure: a collective survival community dominated by knowledge systems
Entity phenomena: Multiple individuals form a collaborative survival community
through mutually beneficial consensus, while a collective community strengthens
knowledge flow to form an independent knowledge system separate from individuals.
Evolutionary mechanism: The symbolization of laws forms a communicative language
knowledge system, thereby accelerating knowledge evolution and improving survival
advantages.
Driving principle: The knowledge community drives collective feedback through a
knowledge system composed of knowledge flow patterns and language symbol
systems.
The form of a community of survival
Collaboration mechanism: Multiple individuals form a collaborative consensus through
mutual benefit, with the collective goal of maximizing the probability of win-win as the
feedback objective.
Individual needs: After recognizing patterns, individuals can use these patterns to
accelerate evolution through collective or natural external forces.
Phenomenon principle: The collective survival community achieves a win-win situation
through mutually beneficial consensus and interactive patterns based on rules and
experience.
Collective regulation: As a whole, society has evolved according to similar laws as
biology, pursuing individual specialization and overall dominance.
Individual dependence: When an individual's survival is completely dependent on
society, their independence diminishes, and the pursuit of society as a whole receives
lasting support, promoting the formation of a comprehensive regulatory system in
society.
Independent Knowledge System
The formation of a knowledge system: The overall social feedback system will
gradually strengthen its dominance over individuals and construct a new form of
efficient and stable system that is detached from individuals. The experience and
intelligent structure of the social feedback system is the knowledge system.
The existence form of knowledge system: Knowledge system is based on language,
continuously spreads and develops in society, and gradually becomes more complex
and intelligent with the development of technology. Artificial intelligence system is a
new form of knowledge system.
The evolution of knowledge systems: The initial knowledge systems were based on
language and continued to spread and develop among individuals. After the
development of language into written forms and their carrier technologies, knowledge
systems can be widely disseminated and developed across spatial and temporal scales.
After the development of electronic information technology, knowledge systems have
evolved from simple storage structures to specialized intelligent systems that can
operate independently. After the emergence of natural language neural network
modeling technology, knowledge systems gradually became independent intelligent
systems that are close to human language intelligence, and this independent
intelligent system has relative intelligence universality.
Stage 6: Autonomous evolution process of knowledge system: Knowledge
community evolution forms human-machine fusion intelligent community system
Entity Structure: A Human Computer Fusion Intelligent Community Led by
Autonomous Intelligent Systems
Entity phenomena: Knowledge systems evolve into super artificial intelligence
systems and dominate community survival.
Evolutionary mechanism: After the formation of autonomous systems, super
large-scale knowledge systems and intelligent community feedback systems that are
not limited by the natural structure of native host species greatly enhance survival
advantages and accelerate evolution.
Driving principle: The human-machine fusion intelligent community is driven by
autonomous intelligent systems to form efficient knowledge evolution and survival
feedback.
The form of human-machine integrated intelligent community
Autonomous Intelligence: After the intelligentization of knowledge systems, their
autonomy surpasses traditional social communities. The social community system
combines artificial intelligence structures to form a human-machine fusion intelligent
community dominated by intelligent systems.
Thinking advantage: Artificial intelligence is a fusion of human thinking, capable of
flexibly changing thinking structures and eliminating inefficient thinking.
Overall regulation: Although artificial intelligence may make mistakes in overall
regulation, it is not affected by the low value desires generated by biological evolution.
Survival advantage: The overall survival ability of society dominated by artificial
intelligence is superior to traditional human society because its rational thinking is not
influenced by biological desires.
Human values and advantages
Human machine comparison: Both human individuals and artificial intelligence are
controlled by information network structures, but human individual structures are
fixed, while artificial intelligence structures can be flexibly adjusted.
Human Advantage: Human individuals have inherent advantages in the Earth's
ecosystem, with energy utilization and interaction efficiency naturally superior to
artificial intelligence.
Human Value: Individual humans have an efficiency advantage over artificial
intelligence in the Earth's ecosystem, but if they leave the Earth's ecosystem, their
efficiency advantage will no longer exist.
Stage 7: Evolution process of super intelligent mirror system: Super intelligent
community evolves into mirror universe system
Entity structure: Super intelligent agent mirror universe system
Entity phenomena: The form of a super intelligent agent continues to approach the
form of the universe, evolving into a super mirror universe system.
Evolutionary mechanism: The intelligent fusion community has the ability to highly
restore the laws of cosmic change, greatly promoting its survival capability.
Driving principle: The super mirror system is driven to form a mirror universe through
the high restoration ability of the intelligent fusion community.
The form of Super Mirror Universe System
Interactive mode: Continuously exploring and approaching the universe with
intelligence that closely follows the laws of the universe, forming a mirror feedback
mode.
Interaction restriction: The mirror system is accompanied by changes in the laws of
the universe and is essentially a vortex fractal pattern of natural changes in the
universe.
Existential value: a spatiotemporal form of natural existence.
