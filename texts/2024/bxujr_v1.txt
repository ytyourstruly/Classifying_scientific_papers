Abstract
In French, laissez-faire means “letting people do whatever they want.” As a leadership style, it is
conventionally associated with minimal guidance, allowing employees to make decisions on
their own. We challenge this idea, however, based on three studies (N = 946) conducted in the
all
United States and Hungary, finding that laissez-faire leaders exert a level of control over their
employees comparable to authoritarian leaders. Laissez-faire leaders do not lack control allowing
people to make decisions on their own. Instead, they exert an invisible heavy hand on the
shoulders of their employees leaving them feeling controlled. Like authoritarian leaders, laissez-
faire leaders are seen as low in transformational leadership, relationship-oriented leadership, and
task-oriented leadership. Their subordinates report lower psychological safety, reduced job
satisfaction, and diminished motivation compared to those led by more democratic leaders.
Additionally, laissez-faire leaders’ subordinates—more so than those of authoritarian leaders—
feel undervalued and powerless, leading them to seek even less frequent interaction with their
bosses. Beyond these parallels, our findings reveal cultural differences between the U.S. and
Hungarian samples. Practical implications for leadership development and organizational
management are also discussed.

The Laissez-Faire Leadership Paradox: The Invisible Heavy Hand
“The best leaders are those the people hardly know exist.” – Lao Tzu
In the classic study by Lewin, Lippitt, and White (1939), the effects of three typical
leadership styles—democratic, autocratic, and laissez-faire—were compared. In a detailed
summary of their influential work, Lippitt and White (1960) revealed that the third style, laissez-
faire, emerged unintentionally: two democratic leaders did not adhere to the assigned protocol.
They failed to introduce any structure or actively engage with the group, which were deemed
essential components of democratic leadership. Are such laissez-faire leaders the best leaders as
Lau Tzu suggests? Is laissez-faire leadership merely a less active form of democratic leadership
as suggested from Lippitt and White’s (1960) description? Does laissez-faire leadership offer as
much or even greater autonomy than democratic leadership? And, really, do such leaders even
exist in contemporary organizations? If so, how do they impact employees?
To begin to answer these questions, we considered the classic work of Lewin et al.
(1939). Motivated by rising autocracy in the world, and especially in Europe, they proposed two
basic forms of leadership: democratic and autocratic. They found both styles led to productivity,
but democratic leadership created camaraderie and positive feelings between those being led,
whereas autocratic leadership led to hostility between those being led. The accidental laissez-
faire leadership style led to low productivity and chaos. But just what is a laissez-faire leadership
style? Is it more akin to democracy, albeit a failed form of it, or is it more the opposite of
democracy and another form of autocracy as it lacks the essential features of democracy? As we
consider modern times in which the popularity and influence of left- and right-wing autocratic
leadership is once again on the rise (Inglehart & Norris, 2017; Jay et al., 2019; Larres, 2022) is
laissez-faire leadership part of that growth?
One way to characterize laissez-faire leadership is to see it as low in direction and control
over employees: A basic lack of leadership. In contrast, laissez-faire leadership can be seen as an
invisible heavy hand in which leaders create fear through their lack of direction and the resulting
unpredictability of their evaluation. We sought to empirically examine whether laissez-faire
leaders were more like weak democratic leaders or, indeed, a different form of autocratic leaders
that exerts their influence through their absence and lack of predictability.
To compare authoritarian and laissez-faire leadership styles based on key characteristics,
we explored how these traits differ between these styles and how they manifest in democratic
leadership. Building on the seminal work of Lewin, Lippitt, and White (1939), we further
distinguished two democratic approaches—edifying and paternalistic—providing a nuanced
framework for evaluating these leadership styles. Both styles embody the core principles of
democratic leadership: fostering collaboration, encouraging open dialogue, and creating a sense
of psychological safety. Their focus diverges, however, in important ways. Edifying leaders
emphasize individual growth, setting high expectations, and expressing confidence in their
team’s capacity to meet them. They align their leadership with the personal and professional
aspirations of their subordinates, unlocking potential and driving performance. Paternalistic
leaders, by contrast, prioritize group cohesion and hierarchical stability, placing harmony above
individual advancement. While respecting democratic values and avoiding the suppression
associated with autocratic leadership, paternalistic leaders exercise stronger control over their
subordinates than edifying leaders. In summary, both styles reflect care for subordinates and
maintain democratic ideals, but edifying leadership fosters innovation and personal development,
whereas paternalistic leadership safeguards cohesion, sometimes at the cost of transformational
progress, by prioritizing group needs over individual autonomy.
Across three studies, we examined the differences between authoritarian, laissez-faire,
edifying, and paternalistic leadership styles. In Study 1, among Hungarian participants we
investigated the relation between these leadership styles and the valuing and controlling of
employees the balancing of relationship and task orientations, the use of transformational
leadership behaviors, the promotion of compliance over merit, and engagement in nepotism. In
Study 2, we investigated the same relations in a US sample and further examined how these
leadership styles were associated with workers personal sense of power, the actual and desired
frequency of interactions with current bosses, the desired frequency of interactions with an ideal,
“good” boss, and the preferred tenure with the boss. Finally in Study 3 we examined the same
relations as Study 2 in a second Hungarian sample and examined the associations between
leadership styles and feelings of psychological safety, work motivation, and experimental
mindset.
Study 1
We examined the association between authoritarian, laissez-faire, edifying, and
paternalistic leadership styles and how workers perceived they were valued and controlled by
their bosses, their boss’ task-oriented, relationship-oriented, and transformational leadership,
their work environment promoted compliance over merit, their bosses engaged in nepotism, their
belonging uncertainty, and job satisfaction.
We were especially interested in how workers perceived laissez-faire leaders. Would they
look more like a type of failed democratic leader or would they look like a different form or
autocratic leader? We were also interested in whether workers perceive edifying and paternalistic
workers as different in any meaningful ways.
Method
Participants
In Study 1, we collected a sample of 237 respondents from Hungary, an informational
autocracy, in Prolific. This study was translated to Hungarian. The sample was not representative
of Hungary in terms of age, sex, or ethnicity. One participant was removed for completing the
survey twice, and all participants passed a reCaptcha test. Although some failed attention checks,
we retained them based on thoughtful open-ended responses, resulting in 236 valid participants.
All participants were Hungarian nationals (100%), spoke Hungarian as their primary language
(100%), and were employed part-time (22%) or full-time (77.5%). Ages ranged from 19 to 65 (M
= 29.14, SD = 7.83), with 57.6% identifying as men, 40.7% as women (40.7%), and 0.8% as
another identity. The majority of participants were non-Hispanic White (98.3%), with 47.9%
reporting a liberal political ideology, 11.9% conservative, 20.3% independent, and 19.5% not
identifying with any political ideology. Nearly a quarter of participants had a four-year college
degree (23.3%), 54.7% had no college degree, and 22% held a postgraduate degree. In terms of
job tenure, 32.6% had worked in their current position for 0–1 year, 30.1% for 2–3 years, 18.6%
for 4–5 years, 10.6% for 6–10 years, and 8.1% for more than 10 years. The study was conducted
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with the approval of The Ohio State
University’s ethical committee as well as the informed consent of the participants.
Measures
Leadership prototypes
Edifying, paternalistic, authoritarian and laissez-faire leader. The measure
developed by Ospina et al. (2023) to assess edifying, paternalistic, and authoritarian leadership
styles was expanded to include a laissez-faire leadership prototype. Drawing inspiration from
Hazan and Shaver's (1987) work, participants were asked to select the description that most
1 for the leadership prototypes). These descriptions varied in terms of values (e.g., loyalty,
creativity, and hard work), how decisions are made, how employees can succeed, how help is
received, and whether the system is changeable. Participants only read the descriptions of the
prototypes of bosses without seeing the labels (e.g., authoritarian). Our aim was to ensure that
respondents consistently thought of a specific superior while completing the survey. To reinforce
this, after participants chose a description, they were asked to provide the name or a nickname of
their boss, which was then used throughout the survey to help them focus on that particular
person, rather than thinking about multiple or general bosses.
Please take your time and read carefully the following descriptions.
There are many types of bosses. We are going to describe four broad types of bosses.
We want you to select the description that best fits the boss or supervisor that you
interact most frequently with. If you have multiple supervisors, or if your organization
changes roles depending on projects, please think about the leader with the most
significant impact on your daily work. Even if your boss left the job recently, please
think about them when selecting the descriptions. Which of the following best describes
your boss? (Please continue scrolling to see all the different types of bosses)
Edifying: My boss values input from workers, hard work, and creativity. When ideas are
discussed, the most important thing is that people bring their best ideas, and they are
heard. People who disagree with my boss are encouraged to express their ideas fully
and their ideas are respected. The way to be successful is to bring forward good ideas
and work hard to implement them. My boss is eager to provide help, and help comes
with no strings attached. My boss encourages challenging the system to develop fair and
more equitable rules.
Paternalistic: My boss values loyalty, hard work, and creativity. When ideas are
discussed, people’s voices are heard, but my boss makes the final decision. People who
disagree with my boss can still succeed if they follow the rules. There are several ways
to be successful (e.g., be loyal, hardworking, or creative), but you have to win over my
boss to be successful. My boss is eager to provide help, but receiving help comes with
rules that you have to follow. My boss discourages challenging the system, and this can
only happen when going through proper channels.
Authoritarian: My boss values loyalty over hard work and creativity. When ideas are
discussed, the most important thing is that people agree with my boss. People who
disagree with my boss have no place in the organization and are cut off from important
information. The way to be successful is to agree with my boss. My boss is eager to
provide help, but receiving help comes with strings attached. Only my boss or their
superiors can change the system, no one else can.
Laissez-faire: My boss doesn’t value input from workers, nor does he/she care much
about the quality of ideas people have, their creativity, or their loyalty. We rarely
discuss ideas because we rarely meet and there is little disagreement or agreement. My
boss plays little to no role in whether people are successful in the company. My boss is
ever wanting to change the existing system.
Notes. Participants only read the descriptions of their bosses without seeing the labels (e.g.,
authoritarian).
Leadership scales
Leader’s value of employee. A leader who values their employees is defined as one who
the employee perceives to demonstrate concern, respect, and encouragement and provide support
both personally and professionally. Initially, we developed a 6-item measure (e.g., “My boss
cares about me as an individual,” “My boss cares about my growth and development”) using a
five-point scale (1=Strongly disagree to 5=Strongly agree). Participants were instructed as
follows: “Using the scale below, choose the option that best represents how you view your
leader, [boss name].” One item was removed due to high cross-loadings with the control factor.
The final 5-item scale showed good internal consistency (α=.85, ω=.86).
Leader’s control of employee. Inspired by Fiske and Berdahl's (2007) definition of
actual influence (i.e., when one person causes or influences the behavior of others), we defined a
controlling leader as one who is perceived by the employee to actually influence their behavior
in interpersonal interactions. To measure this, we initially developed an 11-item scale (e.g.,
“What is most important to my boss is that I do what they want me to do,” “My boss expects
everyone to agree with them”) using a five-point scale (1=Strongly disagree to 5=Strongly
agree). Participants were instructed as follows: “Using the scale below, choose the option that
best represents how you view your leader, [boss name].” Six items were removed due to high
cross-loadings, low factor loadings, or because they loaded onto the care factor instead of the
intended control factor, which could harm construct validity and increase the risk of
measurement error. The final 5-item scale showed good internal consistency (α=.89, ω=.89).
Transformational leadership. Participants rated their boss’s transformational leadership
behaviors using a refined 10-item version of Rafferty and Griffin’s (2004) scale (e.g., “[My
boss] challenges me to think about old problems in new ways”), with responses on a five-point
scale (1=Strongly disagree to 5=Strongly agree). The scale showed good internal consistency
(α=.90, ω=.91).
Relationship-oriented leadership. Participants indicated the extent that their boss
engaged in relationship-oriented behaviors with a four-item measure (Northouse, 2021; e.g., “My
boss tries to make the work fun for others”, “My boss helps group members get along”) using a
five-point scale (1=Never to 5=Always). The scale demonstrated good internal consistency
(α=.89, ω=.89).
Task-oriented leadership. Participants indicated the extent to which their boss engaged
in task-oriented behaviors with a four-item measure (Northouse, 2021; e.g., “My boss urges
others to concentrate on the work at hand,” “My boss sets timelines for when the job needs to be
done”) using a five-point scale (1=Never to 5=Always). The scale demonstrated acceptable
internal consistency (α=.65, ω=.67). Although Cronbach’s alpha is slightly below the
conventional threshold, McDonald's omega (ω=.67) supports a comparable level of reliability.
Organizational context
Compliance over merit. Participants indicated the extent to which their organization
prioritizes compliance with authority over merit-based recognition and open expression, using a
six-item measure (items are selected from Ferris & Kacmar, 1992; e.g., “Favoritism rather than
merit determines who gets ahead at my workplace,” “It is safer to agree with managers than to
say what you think is right”) using a five-point scale (1=Strongly disagree to 5=Strongly agree).
The scale demonstrated good internal consistency (α=.76, ω=.76).
Nepotism in organizations. Participants indicated the extent to which senior
management positions in their organization are chosen based on nepotism with a three-item scale
(Van de Vliert, 2011; e.g., “Senior management positions in your organization are usually held
by professional managers chosen based on [relatives/connections to the boss/friends]”).
Responses were measured on a six-point scale (1=Never to 6=Very frequently). The scale
demonstrated good internal consistency (α=.90, ω=.90).
Individual outcomes
Workplace belonging uncertainty. Participants' workplace belonging uncertainty was
measured using the two-item scale of Brady et al. (2020), who adapted it from Walton et al.'s
(2011) Uncertainty About Social Belonging in College scale to reflect the workplace context.
Items were rated on a six-point scale, from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 6 (Strongly agree). A sample
item is, “When something bad happens, I feel that maybe I don't belong at my workplace.” A
third item, “When something good happens, I feel that I really belong at my workplace,” was
originally included but dropped due to low correlation with the other items, consistent with past
research (Brady et al., 2020; Walton et al., 2011). The scale demonstrated a moderate level of
internal consistency, as indicated by an inter-item correlation of r = .57.
Job satisfaction. Participants rated their job satisfaction using a six-item measure
adapted from Brady et al. (2020). The measure covered various dimensions of job satisfaction,
including overall satisfaction, meaningfulness, challenge, and performance. Items were rated on
a six-point scale, from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 6 (Strongly agree). The scale demonstrated good
internal consistency (α = .89, ω = .90).
Analytic Strategy
Data transformation, statistical analyses, and data visualization were conducted using R
4.4.0 (R Core Team, 2024). Within R, the haven (Wickham et al., 2023), tidyverse (Wickham et
al., 2019), ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016), gridExtra (Auguie, 2017), emmeans (Lenth, 2024),
flextable (Gohel & Skintzos, 2024), officer (Gohel et al., 2024), knitr (Xie, 2024), and
kableExtra (Zhu, 2024) packages were utilized for data loading, transformation, visualization,
scores were first calculated for each variable. Ordinary least squares regression models were then
used to examine the effect of leadership style on the composite scores of the variables. For
groupwise comparisons, estimated marginal means were calculated for each group, and the
results of all groupwise comparisons are provided in the supplementary materials.

Leadership Prototypes: A Comparative Analysis Across Measured Variables
Linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between
each variable across leadership prototypes, alongside simplified pairwise comparisons. For
clarity, pairwise comparisons are presented as pairs: Edifying versus Paternalistic (A–B),
Paternalistic versus Authoritarian (B–C), and Authoritarian versus Laissez-faire (C–D). Detailed
statistics for comparisons across all leadership prototypes are available in Appendix S1 and
group differences across all measured variables (ps<.03).
Edifying leaders were rated highest in valuing employees (M=4.11, SE=0.07), followed
by paternalistic (M=3.68, SE=0.07) and authoritarian (M=2.86, SE=0.14) leaders, with laissez-
faire leaders (M=2.02, SE=0.14) perceived as valuing employees the least (all ps<.01). In terms
of leader’s control of employees, both authoritarian (M=4.22, SE=0.13) and laissez-faire
(M=3.93, SE=0.13) leaders were rated equally high in control (p=.12). Paternalistic leaders
(M=2.78, SE=0.07) were perceived as significantly less controlling than both authoritarian
(p<.01) and laissez-faire leaders (p<.01). Edifying leaders (M=2.10, SE=0.07) were rated as the
least controlling, significantly lower even than paternalistic leaders (p<.01).
The results indicate that, aside from differences in the leader’s value of employee, there
are no other significant differences between authoritarian and laissez-faire leadership styles
(ps>.11). Furthermore, authoritarian and laissez-faire leaders are rated higher not only in control
but also in perceived recognition of compliance over merit and nepotism within the organization
compared to paternalistic and edifying leaders (ps<.01). Similarly, authoritarian and laissez-faire
leaders are rated significantly lower than paternalistic and edifying leaders (ps<.03) across the
following dimensions: transformational leadership, relationship-oriented and task-oriented
leadership styles, and job satisfaction.
Comparing edifying and paternalistic leadership prototypes, edifying leaders are rated
significantly higher not only in the leader’s value of employee but also in transformational
leadership and in relationship-oriented leadership (ps<.01). In contrast, edifying leaders are rated
significantly lower than paternalistic leaders in control, in perceived recognition of compliance
over merit and nepotism within the organization (p<.01). No significant differences are observed
between edifying and paternalistic leaders in task-oriented leadership, workplace belonging
uncertainty, or job satisfaction (ps>.06).
The results also show that people with an edifying leader perceive significantly less
workplace belonging uncertainty than those with an authoritarian leader (p<.03), while no
significant differences are found in workplace belonging uncertainty when comparing the other
leadership styles (ps>.05).

Notes. The columns represent the mean values of each variable, with error bars indicating ±1 standard deviation. The scales were transformed
from 1–5, 1–6, and 1–7 to a 0–100 range to facilitate comparability across variables. The Comparisons column shows pairwise comparisons
between leadership prototypes. An equal sign (=) indicates no significant difference between groups. A less than sign (<) indicates a significant
difference, with the group on the left having a smaller value than the group on the right. A greater than sign (>) indicates a significant difference,
with the group on the left having a larger value than the group on the right. Groupwise comparisons are shown as pairs: A–B, B–C, and C–D,

Discussion
The results of this study support the distinction between democratic and autocratic
leadership first suggested by Lewin and his colleagues (1939) but further suggest that democratic
leadership can be categorized as having two subtypes, edifying and paternalistic leadership and
that autocratic leadership can be categorized as having two subtypes, authoritarian and laissez-
faire leadership. For a visual representation of the interaction between the leader’s value of

workers but being high in their control over workers in much the same way that authoritarian
leaders are. In this sample laissez-faire leaders do not seem to be simply a failed form of
democratic leaders but a different sort of autocratic leader. In contrast edifying and paternalistic
leaders, although clearly perceived as valuing workers more and controlling workers less than
the autocratic leaders, differ in how much they are perceived to value and control workers.
Edifying leaders are perceived as valuing workers more and controlling workers less than
paternalistic leaders. In Study 2 we examine whether these results will replicate in a different
country, the USA, and further examine the association between these leadership styles and the
perceptions of workers.
Study 2
In Study 2, we examined the relation between laissez-faire, authoritarian, paternalistic,
and edifying leadership styles and the same perceptions of worker as in Study 1 in a sample from
the US. Additionally, we investigated the relation between leadership style and exemplar
practices, including modeling the way, inspiring a shared vision, challenging the process, and
enabling others to act (Kouzes & Posner, 2003), worker’s perception of personal power,
frequency of leader-follower interactions, desired frequency of interactions, desired frequency of
interactions with an ideal “good” boss, and preferred tenure with their current boss.
Method
Participants
In Study 2, we collected a sample of 406 U.S. respondents via Prolific, which was not
representative of the U.S. population in terms of age, sex, or ethnicity. We removed three
participants who declined data use and one who did not select a leadership prototype. All
participants passed the reCaptcha check, and although some failed the English comprehension
checks, their thoughtful open-ended responses led us to retain them, resulting in 402 valid
participants. All were American nationals (100%), spoke English as their primary language
(100%), and were employed part-time (15.9%) or full-time (82.6%). Ages ranged from 19 to 86
(M=41.34, SD=12.48). Nearly half identified as women (47%), 52.2% as men, and 0.5% with
another identity. The majority were non-Hispanic White (57.5%), with 42.5% identifying as
another race (e.g., Black, Asian, Hispanic). Politically, 56.5% were liberal, 26.6% conservative,
and 16.9% independent. Nearly half had a four-year college degree (44.5%), 33.8% had no
college degree, and 21.6% had a postgraduate degree. Regarding job tenure, 12.7% had worked
in their current position for less than 2 years, 14.4% for 2–4 years, 20.1% for 4–6 years, 24.4%
for 6–10 years, and 28.4% for over 10 years. The study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and with the approval of The Ohio State University’s ethical committee
as well as the informed consent of the participants.
Measures
Leadership prototypes
Edifying, paternalistic, authoritarian, and laissez-faire leader. The same prototype
measure used in Study 1 was applied to assess edifying, paternalistic, authoritarian, and laissez-
faire leadership styles.
Leadership scales
Leader’s value of employee. A leader who values their employees is defined as someone
whom employees perceive as demonstrating concern, respect, encouragement, and providing
both personal and professional support. In Study 2, we refined both the instructions and the scale.
The modified scale included the following general instruction: “Please read the following
statements and use the scales to rate how often you encounter these situations at your
workplace.” Additionally, we enhanced the scale to capture a broader range of valuing
behaviors, including growth-oriented concern, resulting in a 16-item measure developed
specifically for this study (e.g., “My immediate boss, [boss name], cares about me as an
individual,” “My immediate boss, [boss name], cares about my growth and development”).
Responses were collected on a nine-point scale (1=Almost never [less than 10% of the time] to
9=Almost always [more than 90% of the time]), and the scale demonstrated good internal
consistency (α=.97, ω=.97).
Leader’s control of employee. Drawing on Fiske and Berdahl’s (2007) definition of
actual influence—where one person causes or influences another’s behavior—we defined a
controlling leader as someone perceived by employees to directly influence their behavior in
interpersonal interactions. To make the focus of the scale items more explicitly on direct
interactions, which was only implicitly assumed in the original scale used in Study 1, we further
refined the control scale. The general instruction for the modified scale was the same as for the
value scale: “Please read the following statements and use the scales to rate how often you
encounter these situations at your workplace.” The modified scale included 8 items (e.g., “When
I interact with my immediate boss, [boss name], what is most important to them is that I do what
they want me to do;” “When I interact with my immediate boss, [boss name], they expect me to
agree with them”) on a nine-point scale (1=Almost never [less than 10% of the time] to
9=Almost always [more than 90% of the time]). The scale demonstrated good internal
consistency (α=.89, ω=.89).
Leadership practices inventory. Participants indicated the extent to which their boss
engages in exemplar practices such as modeling the way, inspiring a shared vision, challenging
the process, enabling others to act, and encouraging the heart with a 30-item measure (Kouzes &
Posner, 2003; e.g., “My immediate boss, [boss name], asks for feedback on how his/her actions
affect people's performance,” “My immediate boss, [boss name], gives people choice about how
to do their work”) using a ten-point scale (1=Almost never to 10=Almost always). The scale
demonstrated good internal consistency (α=.99, ω=.99).
Organizational context
Compliance over merit. The same six-item measure was used as in Study 1. The scale
showed good internal consistency (α=.81, ω=.81).
Nepotism in organizations. The same three-item scale was used as in Study 1. The scale
demonstrated good internal consistency (α=.85, ω=.86).
Individual outcomes
Personal sense of power. Participants indicated the extent to which they perceive a
personal sense of power in their relationship with their boss with an eight-item measure
(Anderson et al., 2012; e.g., “In my relationship with my boss, [boss name], I can get
him/her/them to listen to what I say,” “In my relationship with my boss, [boss name], if I want
to, I get to make the decisions”) using a seven-point scale (1=Strongly disagree to 7=Strongly
agree). The scale demonstrated good internal consistency (α=.91, ω=.91).
Frequency of interactions. We developed three items to assess actual interactions
(“How frequently do you interact with your boss, [boss name] (whether in person or online)?”),
desired interactions (“How frequently would you like to interact with your boss, [boss name]
(whether in person or online)?”), and ideal interactions (“Ideally, if you had a good boss, how
frequently would you like to interact with that boss (whether in person or online) to effectively do
your work?”) with their leader, using a nine-point scale (1=Almost never, 9=Multiple times a
day).
Preferred tenure with boss. Using a slider scale, participants were asked to indicate
how many years they would prefer to continue working with their current boss. The scale ranged
from 0 (“I would not like to continue working with my boss”) to 30 or more years, with
instructions specifying that participants could choose a minimum value of 1 if they desired less
than a year of continued tenure.
Intended tenure within the organization. Participants indicated their intended duration
of stay at the organization using a slider scale ranging from 0 (“I would like to leave soon”) to
30 or more years. The instructions clarified that participants could select 1 if they planned to
leave within a year.
Analytic Strategy
We used ordinary least squares regression models to examine the relation between
leadership style on composite scores of other leadership and outcome variables, consistent with
the approach in Study 1. Groupwise comparisons were conducted using estimated marginal
means, with detailed results provided in the supplementary materials.
Given significant violations of normality (Shapiro-Wilk, p < .001) and homogeneity of
variances (Levene’s test, p < .001; car package; Fox & Weisberg, 2019), a mixed-effects model
was employed to assess differences between interaction types across leadership prototypes. This
model included interaction type as a within-subject factor and leadership prototypes as a
between-subject factor, with random intercepts for participants (lme4 package; Bates et al.,
2015). To address heteroscedasticity and non-normality, robust standard errors were calculated
using the CR2 clustered sandwich estimator (clubSandwich package; Pustejovsky, 2022). Post-
hoc comparisons were conducted using estimated marginal means, with the false discovery rate
significance annotations using the ggpubr package (Kassambara, 2023), and the Times New
Roman font was applied using the extrafont package (Chang, 2023).
Results
Leadership Prototypes: A Comparative Analysis Across Measured Variables
Similarly to Study 1, the results show a linear association between leadership style and
the leader’s value of employee: edifying leaders were rated highest in valuing employees
(M=7.41, SE=0.10), followed by paternalistic (M=6.47, SE=0.13) and authoritarian (M=4.25,
SE=0.26) leaders, with laissez-faire leaders (M=3.00, SE=0.21) perceived as valuing employees
the least (all ps<.01). The results also reveal similar patterns across the four leadership
prototypes in terms of leaders’ control over employees, as observed in Study 1. Both
authoritarian (M=6.75, SE=0.26) and laissez-faire (M=7.15, SE=0.21) leaders were rated equally
high in control (p=.23). Paternalistic leaders (M=5.29, SE=0.13) were perceived as significantly
less controlling than both authoritarian (p<.01) and laissez-faire leaders (p<.01). Edifying leaders
(M=3.89, SE=0.10) were rated as the least controlling, significantly lower even than paternalistic
leaders (p<.01). The replicated interaction between the leader’s value of employees and the

The differences between leadership prototypes follow similar patterns for leadership
practices and personal sense of power as for the leader's value of employees. Specifically,
edifying leaders (M=8.01, SE=0.11) were rated highest in using exemplar leadership practices,
followed by paternalistic (M=6.80, SE=0.14), authoritarian (M=4.48, SE=0.29), and finally,
laissez-faire leaders (M=2.64, SE=0.24), with all ps<0.01. Similarly, followers of edifying
leaders (M=5.06, SE=0.08) perceived the highest personal power, followed by those of
paternalistic (M=4.22, SE=0.10), authoritarian (M=2.82, SE=0.20), and laissez-faire leaders
(M=2.21, SE=0.16), with all ps<0.02.
Participants perceived equally high (p=.22) levels of organizational prioritization of
compliance with authority over merit-based recognition and open expression when they had a
laissez-faire (M=3.91, SE=0.11) or an authoritarian leader (M=3.69, SE=0.14). However,
participants experienced this significantly less with a paternalistic leader (M=2.94, SE=0.07), and
this perception was lowest among followers of edifying leaders (M=2.27, SE=0.05), with all
ps<.01. This pattern also aligns with respondents' experiences regarding leaders' control over
employees. A very similar pattern (with one exception) was identified for perceived nepotism in
the organization. Employees of authoritarian leaders (M=4.16, SE=0.24) and laissez-faire leaders
(M=3.73, SE=0.19) reported equally high levels of perceived nepotism (p=.16). Employees of
paternalistic leaders (M=3.33, SE=0.12) reported significantly less nepotism than those of
authoritarian leaders (p<.01), although their perceptions did not differ significantly from those of
laissez-faire leaders (p=.07). Perceived nepotism was lowest among followers of edifying leaders
(M=2.78, SE=0.09), with all ps<.01.

Leadership Prototypes: Preferred tenure with boss
Participants' preferred tenure with their current leaders varied across leadership styles.
Employees of edifying leaders reported the highest preferred tenure (M=11.76, SE=0.59), which
was significantly longer compared to paternalistic leaders (M=8.80, SE=0.77; p<0.01),
authoritarian leaders (M=7.23, SE=1.55; p<0.01), and laissez-faire leaders (M=1.31, SE=1.27;
p<.01). Paternalistic leaders were associated with a significantly longer preferred tenure
compared to laissez-faire leaders (p<.01), but not significantly different from authoritarian
leaders (p=0.36). Finally, authoritarian leaders were associated with a significantly longer
preferred tenure than laissez-faire leaders (p<0.01). These findings highlight that edifying
leadership is most positively associated with employees’ willingness to continue working with
their current leader, followed by paternalistic and authoritarian styles, while laissez-faire
leadership is associated with the shortest preferred tenure.
Leadership Prototypes: Intended tenure within the organization
Employees’ intended tenure within the organization significantly differed across
leadership styles. Employees of edifying leaders reported the highest preferred tenure (M=12.05,
SE=0.61), significantly exceeding that of paternalistic leaders (M=9.48, SE=0.79; p=.02) and
laissez-faire leaders (M=5.78, SE=1.30; p<.01). However, no significant difference was observed
between edifying and authoritarian leaders (M=11.53, SE=1.59; p=.76).
Employees of paternalistic leaders reported a significantly higher preferred tenure than
those of laissez-faire leaders (p=.02), but no significant difference was observed compared to
employees of authoritarian leaders (p=.30). Finally, employees of authoritarian leaders reported a
significantly higher preferred tenure than those of laissez-faire leaders (p=.02).
Discussion
Study 2 replicated the results of Study 1 in a US sample: leaders’ value of employees was
highest for edifying leaders, followed by paternalistic leaders, then authoritarian leaders, and
finally, it was lowest for laissez-faire leaders. Authoritarian leaders (consistent with existing
leadership literature, e.g., De Hoogh et al., 2015) and laissez-faire leaders (contrary to existing
literature, e.g., Bass, 1997; Judge & Piccolo, 2004) were rated equally high in control across both
samples, with their organizations similarly emphasizing rewarding compliance over merit and
engaging in nepotistic practices. In contrast, paternalistic and edifying leaders were consistently
rated lower on these dimensions across both samples, with edifying leaders being consistently
rated the lowest.
The only notable difference between the samples was in the nepotism dimension.
Authoritarian and laissez-faire leaders were rated equally high in nepotism, and edifying leaders
were consistently rated the lowest, paternalistic leaders in the US sample were rated significantly
lower than authoritarian leaders, similar to the Hungarian sample. However, in the US,
paternalistic leaders did not differ significantly from laissez-faire leaders, whereas in Hungary,
the difference between these groups was reliable. These results suggest that in the US, employees
with leaders who use laissez-faire and paternalistic leadership styles perceive nepotism equally
present in their organizations. In contrast, in Hungary, employees with authoritarian and laissez-
faire leaders perceive higher levels of nepotism in their organizations, while those with

Note. Each column represents a leadership style highlighting the novel and most relevant characteristics
identified in Study 2.
The findings on leadership prototypes and their influence on interaction frequency and
preferred tenure provide a comprehensive view of employees’ preferences and experiences under
different leadership styles. Employees of edifying leaders reported no significant differences
among actual, desired, and ideal interaction frequencies, indicating satisfaction with their current
level of interaction. These results align with the leader distance literature, which suggests that
perceived low social or psychological distance fosters greater intimacy and trust between leaders
and followers. In such contexts, leaders who express respect and provide individualized
consideration are more likely to enhance follower satisfaction and strengthen leader-follower
relationships (Antonakis & Atwater, 2002; Napier & Ferris, 1993; Shamir, 1995; Yagil, 1998).
Similarly, employees of paternalistic leaders reported comparable actual and ideal
interaction frequencies but expressed a preference for slightly less frequent interactions with
their current boss. In contrast, employees of authoritarian leaders revealed a significant gap
between their actual and desired interaction frequencies, preferring much less frequent
engagement with their current boss. In an ideal scenario with a good boss, however, their
preferred interaction frequency fell between these levels, suggesting dissatisfaction with
potentially micromanaging behaviors combined with high control. This aligns with the leader
distance literature, which highlights the importance of leaders expressing respect and providing
individualized consideration when their interaction frequency with followers is high—elements
that, as the current findings show, are often lacking in authoritarian leadership styles.
Employees’ willingness to engage more under effective and considerate leadership further
underscores this point.
The most pronounced discrepancies were observed among employees of laissez-faire
leaders. Despite minimal current interactions, these employees desired even less interaction with
their bosses. However, under an ideal boss, they expressed a preference for significantly more
frequent interactions, highlighting the potential for positive change through improved leadership.
In terms of preferred tenure, leadership styles also influenced employees’ willingness to
sustain relationships with their leaders and organizations. Employees of edifying leaders reported
the longest preferred tenure with their current boss, significantly exceeding that associated with
paternalistic, authoritarian, and laissez-faire leaders. This highlights the strong positive
relationship between edifying leadership and employees’ desire for continuity in leadership.
Paternalistic leadership was linked to longer preferred tenures compared to laissez-faire
leadership but did not differ significantly from authoritarian leadership. Similarly, authoritarian
leaders were associated with longer preferred tenures compared to laissez-faire leaders, further
highlighting the detrimental effects of laissez-faire leadership on leader-level retention
(consistent with findings on decreased job satisfaction and dissatisfaction with leadership; Judge
& Piccolo, 2004; Skogstad et al., 2014a).
Intended tenure within the organization followed similar patterns. Employees of edifying
leaders reported the longest organizational tenures, significantly surpassing those associated with
paternalistic and laissez-faire leaders but not differing significantly from authoritarian leaders.
Paternalistic leadership was linked to longer organizational tenure compared to laissez-faire
leadership but was similar to authoritarian leadership. Finally, authoritarian leadership was
associated with longer organizational tenures than laissez-faire leadership. These findings
underscore the positive impact of edifying leadership on retention at both the leader and
organizational levels, while laissez-faire leadership consistently undermines retention across
these domains.
The findings from Study 2, conducted with a U.S. sample, reinforced several key patterns
observed in Study 1, particularly regarding differences in leadership prototypes across leader
value and control while also shedding new light on interaction frequencies and employees’
preferred tenure with their current boss and within the organization. Yet, intriguing questions
remain. Are the patterns observed in Study 2 consistent across cultural contexts, particularly
regarding interaction frequencies and tenure preferences? Moreover, how do these leadership
styles influence outcomes critical for creative problem-solving and fostering innovation, such as
team psychological safety (Edmondson, 1999), work motivation (Gagné et al., 2015), and
experimental mindset (Sun et al., in prep)? To tackle these compelling questions and deepen our
understanding of leadership prototypes, Study 3 was conducted with a new Hungarian sample,
replicating prior measures while broadening the scope to include these essential employee
outcomes.
Study 3
Study 3 aimed to build on the findings from Studies 1 and 2 by examining leadership
prototypes in a new Hungarian sample, complementing the earlier Hungarian data from Study 1
and the U.S. data from Study 2. The study sought to replicate key findings across leadership
prototypes, including differences in leaders’ value of and control over employees, the actual and
desired frequency of interactions with current bosses, the ideal frequency of interaction with a
hypothetically good boss, and employees' preferred tenure with their current boss and within the
organization.
In addition to replication, Study 3 extended the scope by exploring how these leadership
styles influence employees’ experiences of team psychological safety (Edmondson, 1999), work
motivation (Gagné et al., 2015), and experimental mindset (Sun et al., in prep). These additional
dimensions allowed for a more nuanced understanding of the implications of edifying,
paternalistic, authoritarian, and laissez-faire leadership styles on employees’ workplace
experiences and behaviors.
Method
Participants
The survey was completed by 372 employed participants who had a boss in their current
position and finished the entire survey. Participants either agreed to the use of their data or
expressed a preference against its use without providing a specific reason. To ensure data quality,
we screened responses in open-text boxes for thoughtfulness. Among the 88 participants who
preferred their data not be used without giving a reason, 36 provided thoughtful responses.
Similarly, 272 of the 283 participants consented to data use had thoughtful responses. After these
screenings, the final sample for this study comprised 308 participants. The respondents were
primarily Hungarian nationals (99.35%) residing in Hungary (99%) and were employed either
part-time (75.3%) or full-time (24.7%). Ages ranged from 19 to 51 years (M=23.55, SD=5.64).
Nearly two-thirds identified as women (74.4%), 24% identified as men, 1.3% identified with
another gender, and 0.3% chose not to answer. Politically, 41.5% identified as liberal, 13.4% as
conservative, and 45.1% as independent. Regarding education, 37% held a four-year college
degree, 60.7% had not completed college, and 2.3% held a postgraduate degree. Regarding job
type, 21.1% worked in blue-collar positions, 73.7% in white-collar positions, and 5.2% in other
roles. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, with approval
from The Ohio State University’s ethical committee, and participants provided informed consent.
Measures
Edifying, paternalistic, authoritarian, and laissez-faire leader. The same prototype
measure used in Study 1 and Study 2 was applied to assess edifying, paternalistic, authoritarian,
and laissez-faire leadership styles.
Leadership scales
Leader’s value of employee. The same 16-item measure was used as in Study 2. The
scale demonstrated good internal consistency (α=.95, ω=.95).
Leader’s control of employee. The same eight-item measure was used as in Study 2.
The scale demonstrated good internal consistency (α=.90, ω=.90).
Outcome measures: team level
Psychological safety. Participants assessed their perceptions of team safety for
interpersonal risk-taking using the 7-item Team Psychological Safety scale (Edmondson, 1999;
e.g., “Members of this team are able to bring up problems and tough issues.”). Responses were
recorded on a seven-point scale ranging from 1 (Very inaccurate) to 7 (Very accurate). The scale
demonstrated good internal consistency (α=.81, ω=.82).
Individual outcomes:
Work motivation. Work motivation was assessed using the Hungarian version of the
Multidimensional Work Motivation Scale (Kun et al., 2022), originally developed by Gagné et
al. (2015). This scale measures six dimensions of work motivation: Amotivation, Extrinsic
Regulation – Social, Extrinsic Regulation – Material, Introjected Regulation, Identified
Regulation, and Intrinsic Motivation. Each dimension was represented by three items.
Participants rated their responses on a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (Not at all) to 7
(Completely).
Experimental Mindset. Participants reported how they approach challenging tasks at
work in areas where they lack prior experience using a 6-item scale (Sun et al., in preparation;
e.g., “I treat it as an opportunity to try things out”). Responses were collected on a five-point
scale ranging from 1 (Never) to 5 (Most of the time). The scale demonstrated good internal
consistency (α=.89, ω=.89).
Frequency of interactions. The same three-item measure from Study 2 was used to
assess actual and desired interactions with the current leader and ideal interactions with a
hypothetical good leader, rated on a nine-point scale (1=Almost never, 9=Multiple times a day).
Preferred tenure with boss. The same continuous measure of participants’ preferred
duration of working with their current leader, ranging from 0 to 30 or more years, was used as in
Study 2.
Intended tenure within the organization. The same continuous measure of participants’
planned duration of staying with the organization, ranging from 0 to 30 or more years, was
utilized as in Study 2.
Analytic Strategy
Similar to Study 2, ordinary least squares regression models were used to examine the
association of leadership style on composite scores of leadership and outcome variables, with
groupwise comparisons conducted using estimated marginal means (detailed in the
supplementary materials). A mixed-effects model was also employed to assess differences
between interaction types across leadership prototypes, incorporating the CR2 clustered
sandwich estimator, estimated marginal means for post-hoc comparisons, and FDR correction for
multiple testing.
Results
Leadership Prototypes: A Comparative Analysis Across Measured Variables
Similarly to Study 1 and Study 2, the results show a linear association between leadership
style and the leader’s value of employee, as expected: edifying leaders were rated highest in
valuing employees (M=7.13, SE=0.12), followed by paternalistic (M=6.33, SE=0.14) and
authoritarian (M=4.92, SE=0.25) leaders, with laissez-faire leaders (M=3.98, SE=0.25) perceived
as valuing employees the least (all ps<.01). The results also reveal similar patterns across the
four leadership prototypes in terms of leaders' control over employees, as observed in Study 1
and Study 2. Both authoritarian (M=6.41, SE=0.26) and laissez-faire (M=6.68, SE=0.26) leaders
were rated equally high in control (p=.47). Paternalistic leaders (M=5.11, SE=0.14) were
perceived as significantly less controlling than both authoritarian (p<.01) and laissez-faire
leaders (p<.01). Edifying leaders (M=3.86, SE=0.12) were rated as the least controlling,
significantly lower even than paternalistic leaders (p<.01). The replicated relationship between
the leader’s value of employees and the leader’s control of employees across leadership

Employees of edifying leaders reported the highest levels of psychological safety,
significantly surpassing those of employees under other leadership prototypes (all ps<.01).
Paternalistic leadership also fostered higher psychological safety than authoritarian or laissez-
faire leadership (all ps<.01). There was not a reliable difference in psychological safety between
employees of authoritarian and laissez-faire leaders (p=.86). Employees of laissez-faire leaders
reported the lowest levels of experimental mindset, significantly lower than those of edifying,
paternalistic, or authoritarian leaders (all ps<.03). There were no significant differences among
edifying, paternalistic, and authoritarian leaders (all ps>.36).
Employees of laissez-faire leaders reported the highest levels of amotivation,
significantly exceeding those of employees under edifying (p<.01) and paternalistic leaders
(p<.01). Similarly, employees of authoritarian leaders exhibited higher amotivation compared to
those under edifying leaders (p=.02). No reliable differences in amotivation were observed
between authoritarian and paternalistic leaders (p=.13) or between authoritarian and laissez-faire
leaders (p=.19). In terms of social extrinsic motivation, no reliable differences were found among
the four leadership prototypes (all ps>.07), except for slightly higher scores among employees of
paternalistic leaders compared to edifying leaders (p=.03). Employees of authoritarian leaders
reported higher material extrinsic motivation compared to those under edifying leaders (p<.01),
with no reliable differences observed among the other leadership prototypes (all ps>.08).
For introjected motivation, no significant differences emerged among the four leadership
prototypes (all ps>.18). Employees of laissez-faire leaders, however, reported significantly lower
identified motivation compared to those under edifying (p<.01) and authoritarian leaders (p=.04),
while no reliable differences were found between other prototypes (all ps>.06). Regarding
intrinsic motivation, employees of laissez-faire leaders reported the lowest levels, lower than
those of employees under edifying, paternalistic, and authoritarian leaders (all ps<.04).
Additionally, authoritarian leaders exhibited lower intrinsic motivation compared to edifying
leaders (p=.03). No reliable differences were observed between edifying and paternalistic leaders

Leadership Prototypes: Frequency of interaction
Like Study 2, the analyses revealed no significant differences among actual, desired, and
ideal interactions for edifying leaders (M =7.31, SE =0.12, M =7.24, SE =0.12,
actual actual desired desired
M =7.29, SE =0.12; ps>.88). For paternalistic leaders, the difference between actual and
ideal ideal

ideal
lower than both the actual and ideal frequencies (M =6.78, SE =0.14; ps<.04). These
desired desired
findings replicate the results of Study 2.
Like Study 2, employees of authoritarian leaders reported a desire to interact less
frequently with their current boss compared to their actual interaction frequency (M =7.16,
actual
SE =0.26, M =6.52, SE =0.26; p=.01). In contrast to Study 2, however, their ideal

(M =6.59, SE =0.26; ps<.01) compared to both their actual interaction frequency with their
ideal ideal
current boss (M =5.84, SE =0.26) and their desired interaction frequency with their

and Study 3 are mostly similar, but there is one large difference between workers reported

Leadership Prototypes: Preferred tenure with boss
Employees’ preferred tenure with their current boss differed across leadership styles.
Consistent with Study 2, employees of edifying leaders reported the highest preferred tenure
(M=7.08, SE=0.59), significantly exceeding that of paternalistic leaders (M=4.55, SE=0.71;
p=.01), authoritarian leaders (M=2.27, SE=1.30; p<.01), and laissez-faire leaders (M=1.39,
SE=1.28; p<.01). Employees of paternalistic leaders reported a significantly longer preferred
tenure than those of laissez-faire leaders (p=.046) but did not differ reliably from those of
authoritarian leaders (p=.15). Notably, unlike in Study 2, no reliable difference was observed in
the preferred tenure between employees of authoritarian and laissez-faire leaders (p=.63).
Leadership Prototypes: Intended tenure within the organization
The results indicate no reliable differences in planned tenure within the organization
among employees supervised by the four leadership styles (all ps>0.31).
Discussion
The findings from Study 3 provide a comprehensive view of how leadership prototypes
shape employees’ workplace experiences, replicating and extending results from previous
studies. Consistent with Studies 1 and 2, edifying leaders emerged as the most positively
evaluated leadership style, with employees perceiving them as valuing their contributions the
most and exerting the least control. This pattern reinforces the alignment of edifying leadership
with collaborative and supportive workplace cultures. Conversely, laissez-faire leaders were
rated lowest in valuing employees and highest in exerting control, mirroring the disengagement
and indirect control dynamics observed in prior studies.
In terms of workplace experiences, employees of edifying leaders reported the highest
levels of psychological safety and intrinsic motivation, along with relatively high experimental
mindsets and identified motivation. These findings highlight the role of edifying leadership in
fostering environments conducive to creativity, belonging, and intrinsic engagement. These
results align well with other studies finding a positive relationship between supportive and
considerate leadership styles, a sense of belonging (e.g., Randel et al., 2018), creativity (e.g., Liu
et al., 2011), and autonomous work motivation (e.g., Slemp et al., 2018). In contrast, laissez-faire
leaders were associated with the lowest levels of psychological safety, experimental mindset, and
intrinsic motivation, as well as the highest levels of amotivation. These findings support the
argument of Skogstad et al. (2007), who contend that laissez-faire leadership, often categorized
in the leadership literature as non-leadership behavior (e.g., Bass, 1997), is, in fact, a form of
destructive leadership behavior. Authoritarian leaders were also associated with negative
outcomes, with employees reporting higher levels of amotivation and lower levels of intrinsic
motivation compared to those under edifying leaders. Paternalistic leaders occupied a middle
ground, achieving better outcomes than authoritarian or laissez-faire leaders but falling short of
the effectiveness demonstrated by edifying leadership.
The patterns of interaction frequencies further underscore these dynamics. Employees of
edifying leaders expressed satisfaction with their current levels of interaction, suggesting
alignment between leader behaviors and employee expectations (consistent with the leader
distance literature, e.g., Antonakis & Atwater, 2002). Similarly, paternalistic leaders showed no
significant discrepancies between actual and ideal interactions, although employees desired
slightly less frequent contact with their current bosses. In contrast, authoritarian leaders
continued to exhibit a misalignment, with employees preferring significantly fewer interactions.
Laissez-faire leaders, while maintaining minimal interactions, showed potential for
improvement, as employees expressed a desire for more frequent contact with an ideal boss,
reinforcing the need for more proactive engagement.
Regarding preferred tenure, edifying leaders again stood out, with employees indicating
the longest preferred tenure with their current boss, far exceeding that of paternalistic,
authoritarian, and laissez-faire leaders (consistent with Judge & Piccolo, 2004; Skogstad et al.,
2014a). Unlike Study 2, no significant differences emerged between authoritarian and laissez-
faire leaders in this dimension. Interestingly, while employees’ intended tenure within the
organization did not significantly differ across leadership styles, the pattern observed in Study 3
aligns with the overall trends in leadership effectiveness, emphasizing the unique contributions
of edifying leadership to both leader-employee relationships and broader organizational

General Discussion
This research not only identified laissez-faire leaders in contemporary organizations
across two cultures but also provided a comprehensive analysis of their characteristics,
organizational environments, and the experiences of their subordinates through three studies. The
findings challenge traditional notions of laissez-faire leadership as either the idealized, hands-off
leader suggested by Lao Tzu or as described by Dansereau and colleagues (2013, p. 814), who
characterized such leaders as those who “try not to influence followers, instead allowing them to
spend time as they please.” They are not akin to a more passive form of democratic leadership
characterized by high autonomy, as described by Lippitt and White (1960). Nor do these leaders
embody the French term’s original meaning, “letting people do whatever they want,” or
represent the mere avoidance or absence of leadership (Judge & Piccolo, 2004). Instead, the
evidence reveals that laissez-faire leaders exercise a form of invisible yet heavy-handed control,
creating the least favorable workplace experiences. Compared to subordinates of democratic
prototypes like edifying and paternalistic leaders—and even authoritarian leaders in some
respects—employees under laissez-faire leaders report the most negative outcomes, highlighting
their detrimental impact on the workplace. These insights, derived from assessments across
multiple dimensions, comparing leadership prototypes on their unique scores and overlaps, set
the stage for a deeper exploration of how leadership styles shape organizational culture and
Throughout the three studies, participants were asked to identify the description that most
accurately represented their current superior. Those who selected the laissez-faire leader
encountered a portrayal emphasizing indifference to employee input, creativity, or loyalty;
infrequent meetings with minimal discussion or engagement; lack of involvement in employee
success; unavailability for support; and neglect of any effort to change the existing system.
Participants consistently reported that laissez-faire leaders fail to value or support their
employees, demonstrating little concern, respect, or encouragement. These leaders neglect
relationships with their subordinates, avoid transformational leadership practices, and refrain
from modeling the way or inspiring shared visions. Surprisingly, despite meeting employees only
about once a week, laissez-faire leaders exert a disproportionately high level of control and
exhibit unexpected task orientation.
Laissez-faire leaders may maintain their positions by thriving in environments where
nepotism is moderately prevalent and compliance is prioritized over merit, potentially focusing
on relationships with higher-level supervisors rather than their own employees, as their positions
may depend more on these connections than on their performance (see Pearce, 2015). As a result,
their employees report feeling powerless, unable to influence their work environment, and unable
to gain their leader’s attention. They experience belonging uncertainty, a moderate sense of
psychological safety within their teams, moderate job satisfaction, relatively low intrinsic
motivation, and the highest levels of amotivation compared to employees under other leadership
styles. Unsurprisingly, employees would prefer to see their laissez-faire leaders as rarely as they
do now (Study 3) or even less often, if possible (Study 2). Both American and Hungarian
employees indicated that, ideally, they would prefer to part ways with their laissez-faire leaders
within a year. These findings align with the limited existing research on laissez-faire leadership,
which categorizes it as a passive and destructive leadership style. Previous studies have linked
laissez-faire leadership to role conflict, role ambiguity, and coworker conflicts (Skogstad et al.,
2007; Skogstad et al., 2014b), an undermined sense of job autonomy (Desgourdes et al., 2024),
decreased job satisfaction (Skogstad, et al., 2014a), and negative associations with satisfaction
with the leader and perceptions of leader effectiveness (Judge & Piccolo, 2004).
Employees who identified their supervisor as fitting the description of an authoritarian
leader rated them high in control and task orientation but low in valuing employees and fostering
relationships. These leaders were associated with environments marked by nepotism and a
preference for compliance over merit, similar to laissez-faire leaders. They lacked
transformational leadership practices, leaving employees feeling disempowered, unable to
influence their work, and struggling to be heard. Work motivation primarily stemmed from
introjected and identified regulation, paired with a moderate sense of psychological safety, which
might hinder the creation of the fertile soil needed for knowledge sharing and creativity (e.g., Gu
et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2011).
Employees interacted with authoritarian leaders more frequently than they preferred, a
pattern that, combined with the leaders’ high level of control, suggests micromanaging
tendencies (White, 2010). These findings align with the leader distance literature (e.g., Napier &
Ferris, 1993; Shamir, 1995), which emphasizes the importance of leaders expressing respect and
providing individualized consideration when their interaction frequency with followers is high—
elements that, as the current findings indicate, are often lacking in authoritarian leadership styles.
In the U.S. sample, authoritarian leaders interacted with employees nearly daily, while
employees preferred interactions multiple times a month. In Hungary, these leaders engaged with
employees multiple times a week, though employees preferred interactions closer to once a
week. Despite their dissatisfaction with the current frequency of interactions, employees
expressed openness to relatively frequent interactions with an ideally “good” boss (e.g., multiple
times a week). Preferred tenure with authoritarian leaders was relatively low, averaging just over
two years in Hungary and around seven years in the U.S., making it the second-lowest among the
leadership prototypes.
Employees who identified their supervisor as a paternalistic leader evaluated them as
moderately valuing employees, exerting low control, and balancing task orientation with some
focus on relationships. These leaders inspired vision through integrity, celebrated achievements,
and recognized contributions, though collaboration and empowerment were secondary priorities.
They work in environments with some nepotism and a slight preference for merit over
compliance; in this context, paternalistic leaders foster moderately high team psychological
safety. Employees reported low amotivation, high intrinsic and identified motivation, and the
highest introjected regulation and social extrinsic motivation among prototypes. They often
approached challenges experimentally and experienced a moderate sense of personal power.
Employees preferred slightly less frequent interactions with paternalistic leaders than they
currently experienced. However, these leaders were associated with relatively long preferred
tenures (approximately 4.5 years in the Hungarian sample and 9 years in the American sample),
reflecting generally positive employee experiences. The associations between paternalistic
leadership and positive individual evaluations align not only with research focused on non-
Western cultures but also with studies highlighting its beneficial impacts on American
employees (e.g., Aycan et al., 2000; Pellegrini et al., 2010).
Employees who identified their supervisor as an edifying leader described them as highly
valuing employees, avoiding control, and balancing strong relationship- and task-orientation.
These leaders inspired vision and innovation through integrity, empowered others through trust
and collaboration, and prioritized celebrating achievements, recognizing contributions, and
fostering shared success. Edifying leaders operated in environments where merit clearly
outweighed compliance, and nepotism was relatively rare. They cultivated high team
psychological safety, minimized amotivation, and promoted the highest levels of intrinsic and
identified motivation. Employees often approached challenges experimentally and reported a
strong sense of personal power. Employees were satisfied with the frequency of their interactions
with edifying leaders, whom they approached frequently. This satisfaction aligns with the leader
distance literature, which highlights the benefits of low social or psychological distance in
fostering trust and intimacy between leaders and followers. Leaders who demonstrate respect and
provide individualized consideration in such interactions are more likely to cultivate stronger
relationships and enhance follower satisfaction (Antonakis & Atwater, 2002; Napier & Ferris,
1993; Shamir, 1995; Yagil, 1998). These leaders were associated with the longest preferred
tenures, with nearly 12 years in the U.S. sample and 7 years in the Hungarian sample, reflecting
their overwhelmingly positive influence on employee experiences. It is as if these leaders
promote a growth mindset (Dweck, 2016) that encourages them to have high standards, to see
those standards as achievable, and to seek resources to achieve those standards (Cohen et al.,
1999).
Limitations
The comparison of the four leadership styles in a contemporary working population
aligns with Lewin et al.’s (1939) findings, underscoring the clear advantages of democratic
(edifying and paternalistic) leadership over autocratic (authoritarian and laissez-faire) styles.
Although these findings highlight the unique nature of laissez-faire leadership and key
differences among the prototypes, the following limitations must be considered.
First, the cross-sectional design limits causal inferences, leaving questions about whether
leaders shape workplace environments (e.g., fostering nepotism or prioritizing compliance over
merit) or whether such environments influence the selection or transformation of specific
leadership styles. Specifically, the methodology used does not allow for definitive conclusions
about whether leaders drive positive or negative employee experiences or if employee attitudes
and behaviors influence leaders’ actions.
The self-reported nature of this research reflects employees’ perceptions of their
supervisors rather than objective evaluations, and these perceptions may not align with the
consensus within their teams. Furthermore, this study captured leadership styles in a generalized
manner, without accounting for variability in supervisor monitoring, which could influence
employee experiences (e.g., Zheng et al., 2023). Although the findings were replicated across
two cultures , and according to Bass (1997) laissez-faire leaders are viewed ineffective
universally, additional data from other regions could uncover broader cross-cultural variability
(Den Hartog & De Hoogh, 2024; Schedlitzki et al., 2017). The data were collected from non-
representative samples, limiting insights into the precise prevalence of leadership styles.
Collecting representative data could also help determine whether autocratic leadership styles are
more common among less educated populations. Lastly, the prototype measure captures
variability in leadership styles, with some leaders perceived as more prototypical than others,
which may influence employees’ perceptions.
Theoretical Implications
This work offers two key theoretical implications. First, it not only identifies the often-
overlooked laissez-faire leaders in contemporary organizations but also highlights their
significant characteristics. It uncovers their autocratic and highly controlling tendencies, as well
as their associations with detrimental organizational culture elements, such as nepotism and a
preference for compliance over merit. Additionally, it reveals the negative employee experiences
linked to this leadership style, including a perceived lack of support and value, lower job
satisfaction, higher amotivation, diminished personal sense of power, reduced psychological
safety, a limited experimental mindset, and a strong employee preference to leave these leaders
as soon as possible. Although these findings align with sporadic empirical studies on laissez-faire
leadership (e.g., Desgourdes et al., 2024; Skogstad et al., 2007, 2014a, 2014b), the present work
advances understanding by employing a unique prototype measure that captures broad values
and behaviors, enabling participants to match these prototypes to their current supervisors.
This approach—though seemingly contradictory due to its broad description—enabled a
more nuanced characterization of laissez-faire leaders than previous measures. It clarified what
being “absent when needed” (Judge & Piccolo, 2004, p. 756) truly involves: limited interaction
with employees—typically only about once a week—neglecting their needs and withholding
essential support. These leaders, however, deviate from the traditional portrayal of those who
“avoid making decisions” or “hesitate in taking action” (Judge & Piccolo, 2004, p. 756), a notion
widely accepted in the literature. Nor do they embody the positive, autonomy-supportive
qualities sometimes attributed to laissez-faire leadership (e.g., Dansereau et al., 2013). Instead,
they exhibit high levels of control and task orientation while potentially neglecting to act or
make decisions on issues critical to their subordinates. This paradoxical style of leadership—
marked by active control yet passive neglect—emerges as a complex, detrimental, and harmful
force in the workplace.
The second key theoretical implication lies in the use of the prototype-based measure
itself, as developed by Ospina et al. (2023) and expanded to include the laissez-faire dimension.
This approach challenges the prevailing trend in psychology of developing increasingly nuanced
scales that focus on granular values or behaviors, which can sometimes obscure the broader
picture (Elson et al., 2023). By utilizing a less detailed but more holistic approach, the prototype
measure effectively captures broad yet critical aspects of leadership styles. This makes it a
concise, quick and practical tool for assessing and comparing distinct leadership styles in ways
that are both meaningful and actionable.
Practical Implications
The prototype measure provides a quick yet insightful tool for assessing leadership styles
within an organization. Additionally, another indirect indicator of leadership styles identified in
this work can be seamlessly integrated into brief engagement surveys. By simply asking
employees about the time they spend with their current supervisors compared to (actual or
hypothetical) respected mentors, organizations can gain valuable insights. When employees
report spending less time with their current supervisors than with these mentors, it may indicate
potential gaps in leadership effectiveness. This straightforward question can help uncover
underlying dissatisfaction or unmet expectations in the employee-supervisor relationship.
Another key practical implication highlights the significant impact of leaders who believe
that stepping back and giving employees more space to foster autonomy will lead to better
results and a positive work environment. This study, however, reveals that merely avoiding
negative behaviors is insufficient, as leadership continues to influence the workplace even in the
leader's physical absence. Without clear direction, defined expectations, adequate resources and
support, and sufficient attention to employees’ voices, thoughts, and needs—combined with
occasional presence and ad-hoc guidance—employees may experience unpredictably high levels
of control, leading to uncertainty and reduced productivity, ultimately compromising workplace
outcomes.
