Abstract
This study proposes an approach to describing personality dynamics through mathematical
modelling of introversion, extroversion, and ambiversion processes. Introversion is interpreted as
a recursive process characterized by deep self-awareness and inner reflection; extroversion is
presented as an iterative process of accumulating and processing external stimuli; and ambiversion
is considered transitivity, integrating the interaction of these two opposing processes. The
developed model is based on principles of complex systems theory, nonlinear dynamics, and
synergetics, enabling the perception of personality as an adaptive and multilayered system.
The results include analytical equations describing the interaction of internal and external
factors. Parameters regulating personality dynamics, such as sensitivity coefficients, weighting
factors of stimuli, and synergy parameters, are also explored.
The practical significance of the proposed model lies in its application in psychotherapy,
education, personnel management, and other areas where it is necessary to consider personality
traits and their dynamics. The model provides new opportunities for diagnosing, forecasting, and
correcting personality changes, enhancing methods of working with individuals.
The findings open some prospects for quantitative personality analysis, providing a
theoretical understanding of its structure and dynamics. They also create a foundation for further
interdisciplinary research in psychology, the cognitive sciences, and social systems.
Specifically, the formalization considered in the context of program algorithms allows for
the creation of functional procedures for AI and robots with differentiated psychological archetypes
(introvert robots, extrovert robots, and ambivert robots).

1. Introduction
Introversion, extroversion, and ambiversion are well-studied and ancient
archetypal constructs. However, paradigms are changing. Modern science moves
beyond the natural, trivial scientific activities of individuals and transitions into the
realm of total formalization of all scientific entities on the basis of quantum models
and artificial intelligence. Consequently, old archetypes begin to exist in a new reality,
requiring their reevaluation from the perspective of evolving descriptive science into
algorithmic and strictly formalized science.
The study of human personality is one of the most complex and multifaceted
tasks in psychology, sociology, and philosophy. Traditional personality models, such
as the Big Five theory or Jungian typologies, provide valuable insights, but they are
often limited by static representations of personality traits and fail to account for the
dynamic nature of human behavior and self-awareness. In a rapidly changing world,
there is a growing need for more flexible and adaptive personality models that can
reflect personality evolution over time and interaction with the environment.
Modern personality research seeks to move beyond traditional typologies and
static characteristics, viewing individuals as complex, multidimensional, and dynamic
systems. Personality is no longer reduced to a set of constant properties; instead, it
emerges as an evolving configuration of processes generating self-awareness,
interaction with the external world, and adaptation to changing conditions. In this
paradigm, integrating philosophy, psychological theory, mathematics, and complex
systems theory becomes particularly significant. This approach allows not only the
interpretation of the phenomena of introversion, extroversion, and ambiversion on a
deeper level but also the creation of a formal model capable of describing their
nonlinear dynamics.
In this study, introversion, extroversion, and ambiversion are presented not as
static traits but as fundamentally different yet interconnected dynamic modes of
personality functioning. The proposed concept suggests the following:
Introversion is recursion, reflecting in-depth internal analysis and a sequential
reinterpretation of one's thoughts and experiences. Introverted processes are
represented as recursive schemes where the current state of the personality depends
on revisiting its previous states, forming a kind of "internal loop" of self-reflection.
Introversion fundamentally represents a process of self-immersion and
reinterpretation of accumulated experiences. It describes the ability of an individual
to turn to their past, analyse previous states, and deepen self-awareness. This process
can be described through recursion, where the current state of the personality is a
function of its previous state. Unlike the static perception of introversion as
"reservedness," here, it is interpreted as a mechanism of deepening and repeated
rethinking, which is consistent with recursive logic.
Extroversion, on the other hand, is associated with the perception and
integration of new external stimuli. It reflects a personality's ability to interact with
the external world, accumulate experiences, and respond to environmental changes.
In mathematical terms, extroversion is described as an iterative process: each new
step adds external influence without deeply altering internal states but rather
expands horizons. Iteration forms the basis of extroversion, allowing personality to
develop through the accumulation of new experiences.
Extroversion is seen as an iterative process that involves the ability of
individuals to expand their experience through the sequential addition of new
external data, social interactions, and cognitive and cultural stimuli. Extroverted
behavior is interpreted as an iterative process of "accumulating" external
information, which acts as the building material for forming new system states.
Ambiversion is understood as transitivity, the ability of the individual to flexibly
switch between recursive (introverted) and iterative (extroverted) modes. It acts as a
mechanism setting the conditions for transitioning between internal reflection and
external expansion, optimizing behavioral strategies depending on the context.
Transitivity provides the necessary adaptability, enabling the individual to avoid
being stuck in one mode and selectively combining internal and external resources to
maximize functional efficiency.
Ambiversion, often viewed as a balance between introversion and extroversion,
is treated in this study as a transitive process. It does not merely balance the two poles
but actively connects the internal and external aspects of personality, allowing flexible
transitions between recursion and iteration. Transitivity ensures system adaptability,
enabling the personality to find optimal behavioral strategies depending on the
context.
The scientific understanding of personality requires the integration of
philosophy, psychology, complex systems theory, and mathematics to create
formalized models capable of explaining behavior. This study is based on a
philosophical foundation linking internal reflection, external interaction, and
adaptive flexibility, manifesting in three key concepts: introversion as recursion,
extroversion as iteration, and ambiversion as transitivity.
This perspective transcends classical approaches, which are predominantly
descriptive and static. In the proposed paradigm, personality is a nonlinear dynamic
system with multiple attractors and transitional states, where introversion,
extroversion, and ambiversion are not merely traits but also dynamic patterns
emerging from the complex interplay of internal and external factors. From the
perspective of complex systems theory, such a model enables the consideration of
personality as a self-organizing structure that maintains dynamic equilibrium
between competing tendencies for self-immersion and outwards expansion.
In terms of applications, this formalization allows the creation of functional
algorithms and procedures for AI and robots with differentiated psychological
archetypes (introverted robots, extroverted robots, and ambiverted robots).
From a methodological point of view, relying on mathematical formalizations
(using recursive and iterative equations, as well as transitive operators), paves the
way for quantitative analysis of personality behavior, enabling the prediction of
transitions from one dynamic mode to another under changing conditions. This
approach has potential for the development of predictive and optimization models
applicable in psychotherapy, coaching, organizational consulting, educational
programs, and other practical areas.
The novelty and originality of this study lies in a radical paradigm shift—from
describing personality in terms of stable factors to viewing it in terms of dynamic
processes. Introversion, extroversion, and ambiversion are no longer considered
substantial attributes but rather become operators that transform internal and
external experiences. This understanding provides deeper insights into the essence of
human psychological life, taking into account the multilevel integration of cognitive,
emotional, and sociocultural influences.
Thus, this work lays the philosophical, conceptual, and methodological
foundation for developing a new scientific paradigm for studying personality—as a
system in which the recursion of introversion, the iteration of extroversion, and the
transitivity of ambiversion form a complex and adaptive dynamic picture of self-
awareness, behavior, and development.
The introduction of an original philosophy and the development of a formalized
model of introversion as recursion, extroversion as iteration, and ambiversion as
transitivity open new horizons in personality research. This approach makes it
possible to describe complex processes of personality dynamics at a deeper level,
creating a theoretical and practical foundation for studying, predicting, and
developing human potential.
Of course, psychological archetypes and our formalization are merely imagos
(images) of the individual (Jung, 1971). They cannot authentically and adequately
reflect the real psychological architecture and construction of personality. However,
formalization can provide opportunities for analysing behavioral structures as a first
approximation and for modelling in artificial intelligence systems.
2. Literature Review
Approaches to studying personality have undergone significant changes over
recent decades. From traditional theories, such as Jung’s concepts, to contemporary
models incorporating complex systems theory and synergetics, each step in
personality research has opened new opportunities for deeper understanding.
If we avoid delving too deeply into distant history, Carl Jung (1971) was
undoubtedly the first to clearly and systematically classify psychological archetypes
(extroversion, introversion, and ambiversion). His groundbreaking ideas laid the
foundation for later theories on personality traits and became an essential part of
psychoanalysis and cognitive psychology. The studies by Eysenck (1967) and Gray
(1981) demonstrated that extroversion and introversion are linked to differences in
cortical arousal levels and responsiveness to stimuli. These works emphasize the
neurobiological basis of personality traits, which is crucial for their mathematical
modelling.
The works of Izard (1991) and Lazarus (1991) highlight the importance of
emotions and their relationships with personality traits. These studies provide deeper
insights into how emotional regulation affects the balance between introversion and
extroversion and personality ability to adapt to changes.
A structured approach to archetypes is addressed in the "Big Five" model (Costa
& McCrae, 1992). A sociocultural perspective has been developed in studies
investigating the influence of context and environment on psychological archetypes
(Markus & Kitayama, 1991). However, these models are static and fail to account for
the dynamics of change, necessitating their further development.
Cognitive theories of personality, such as models of parallel information
processing (Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986), view personality as a system that
processes external and internal stimuli through complex cognitive mechanisms.
These approaches enable the development of dynamic personality models that can
integrate various factors influencing behavior.
The systemic approach to describing archetypes as dynamic and adaptive
phenomena was advanced in formal models by Prigogine (1984). Recursive models
are widely used in cognitive psychology to describe memory and learning processes
(Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986). Iterative approaches, such as models for processing
external stimuli, are used to analyse responses to the environment (Rescorla &
Wagner, 1972).
Synergetics, developed by Haken (1983), describes the interaction of internal
and external processes in systems, finding application in modelling ambiversion. The
concept of transitivity in personality processes involves enhancing adaptability by
integrating opposing processes.
Psychotherapeutic practice has long focused on diagnosing personality traits
and working with them. Studies in psychotherapy have shown that the use of
personality models can improve diagnostics and the development of personalized
treatment methods (Beck et al., 1990). The application of mathematical models allows
for deeper analysis of personality dynamics.
Biggs (1993) highlights the importance of adapting teaching methods to
individual student characteristics, including their tendencies toward introversion or
extroversion. Research aimed at identifying students’ inclinations toward
introversion and extroversion helps optimize teaching methods and improve their
effectiveness.
In corporate settings, understanding employees' personality profiles is a critical
aspect of enhancing team efficiency and productivity (Goleman, 1995). Mathematical
modelling can form the basis for creating more balanced and successful teams.
Understanding how different personality types (introverts and extroverts) interact
helps create balanced groups that consider their strengths and weaknesses.
The studies of Hofstede (1984) and Triandis (1995) show how introversion and
extroversion manifest in different cultures. For example, collectivist cultures (e.g.,
Japan) emphasize introversion, whereas individualist cultures (e.g., the United States)
encourage extroversion.
Thus, individuals can be effectively described via mathematical models that
integrate concepts from psychology, the cognitive sciences, and complex systems
theory. This study builds on and extends these approaches, proposing new ways to
analyse personality dynamics through the interaction of internal and external
processes.
3. Results
3.1. Introversion as Recursion
At one point, Niklas Luhmann defined the attribute of autopoiesis (Maturana,
1980) as follows: “Autopoiesis is recursive, hence symmetric, and thus a
nonhierarchical event” (Luhmann, 1987). The principles of how basic processes
sustain a system’s integrity can similarly be applied to specific cases of psychological
archetypes, particularly introversion.
Considering the processes of self-immersion, internal analysis, and
reinterpretation, which are strongly expressed in introversion, we can interpret
introversion as recursion. Indeed, introverts often turn inwards, analysing external
environments, internal emotions, and their thoughts. An introvert delves deeper and
deeper into layers of consciousness during reflection and analysis. Thus, in
psychological processing, the connection between various layers of personal
experience and the subconscious is essential for an introvert.
It is evident that an individual does not change instantaneously; their
perception and thinking are rooted in prior experiences. Hence, each new
psychological or intellectual state of a personality depends on its previous state. While
this is also true for extroverts and ambiverts, for introverts, past experiences are
dominant in shaping and achieving new states. This recursive dependency on the
dynamics of states can be expressed as:
𝐼(𝑛 − 1, 𝐷),
where:
n - time step (a discrete moment in time when the state is observed),
D - depth level of the state.
The variable n indicates the discrete time index, which describes sequential
changes in the state of the individual. For example, n=0 can correspond to the initial
state of the system (the starting point of analysis or observation), and n=1,2,3…
represent subsequent steps describing the evolution of the state.
This reflects the recursion of introversion, where each new state is formed on
the basis of the prior state. Overall, the numerical sequence mirrors the process of
personality formation, state by state. Suppose that we know only one state of an
individual at the initial moment, I(0,D), which is strictly fixed (e.g., 1 for all D).
Subsequently, at each following step (n=1, n=2,…), the current state is calculated on
the basis of the previous state I(n−1,D), considering internal and external factors.
Here, D represents the depth level of the state, which corresponds to the
layered position in an individual’s multilayered structure, reflecting the personality's
complexity, from superficial to deep layers of self-awareness. Higher values of D
correspond to deeper levels of self-awareness, whereas lower values of D reflect more
superficial states.
In our interpretation, D is the current level of introversion I(n,D), which
interacts with the underlying levels. The deeper the level (D), the more it relies on the
cumulative influence of all preceding levels. Naturally, all levels are interrelated.
Higher levels (D) depend on the evolution of lower layers, creating a hierarchical
structure where changes at the lower levels significantly impact the higher ones and
vice versa.
Superficial levels are associated with sensory perceptions of reality, such as
reactions to external stimuli or irritants. In contrast, deeper levels correspond to
fundamental aspects of personality, such as self-contemplation, worldview, beliefs, or
core memory structures. Changes at these levels occur more slowly.
Thus, the concepts of n and D allow us to describe an individual as a
simultaneously evolving (through changes in nnn) and interacting (through changes
in D) multilayered mental and psychophysical system.
Since individuals do not change instantaneously and rely instead on their past
experiences, each new state depends on the previous state. This recursive dependency
is expressed as I(n−1,D). However, each new state also carries a proportion of the past
state. This principle resembles blockchain technology, where each new block carries
specific information about the previous block.
The influence of the previous state can be represented as:
(𝑘 (𝐼(𝑛 − 1, 𝐷)) ),
where:
m>1 - degree of amplification of the influence of past states,
k - amplification coefficient determining the "intensity" of the influence of the
previous state.
Here, the influence of past states is amplified when the power m>1. This
enables the modelling of various scenarios where accumulated internal experience
(e.g., deep reflection) significantly alters the current state. The coefficient k, in a
psychological context, might correspond to the depth of introversion or its "energy
resource." Clearly, an individual's level of introversion is not a universal constant but
varies for different introverts.
The influence of lower levels can be expressed as:
𝐷−1
𝑤 ⋅ ∑ 𝐼(𝑛, 𝑑)
𝑑=1
where the weight coefficient w determines the strength of influence that
foundational levels exert on the current state. This allows modelling scenarios where
the impact of "simpler" processes on higher levels is either significant (w is high) or
minimal (w is low).
This expression can be interpreted as the interconnection of various layers of
individual experience, which is consistent with Jung's works and cognitive psychology
studies emphasizing the multilayered structure of personality and the interaction of
its elements.
Thus, the general equation for introversion as recursion can be written as:
𝐷−1
𝐼(𝑛, 𝐷) = 𝑘 (𝐼(𝑛 − 1, 𝐷)) + 𝑤 ⋅ ∑ 𝐼(𝑛, 𝑑)
𝑑=1
This recursive introversion equation is based on the idea of personality's
multilayered nature, its capacity for self-reflection, and the influence of external levels
on internal states.
3.2. Extroversion as Iteration
In our notation, extroversion is interpreted as iteration. Broadly speaking,
extroversion is understood as the ability of an individual to perceive and accumulate
external stimuli through interaction with the surrounding environment. This process
is characterized by the linear accumulation of information, meaning that the
individual responds to external stimuli sequentially, adding their influence to the
current state. Essentially, this is the iteration operation.
In this case, the individual is considered a system that interacts with the
external environment. The influence of external factors is integrated iteratively,
aligning with approaches from the theory of dynamic systems.
In the first approximation, extroversion is largely determined by external
signals and their significance. Each new state of personality is built upon the previous
state, taking into account the current external influences. Accordingly, the state of an
individual at time n depends on their state at the previous time n−1:
𝐸(𝑛) = 𝐸(𝑛 − 1) + 𝛥𝐸,
where ΔE is the change in state over a single step. This change depends on the
external stimuli acting at time n, i.e., during the transition from one state to the next.
The change ΔE is determined by the cumulative effect of external factors. Each
external stimulus influences the individual's state, with the degree of this influence
being regulated by a weight.
This process of change can be formalized as follows:
𝛥𝐸 (𝑛) = 𝑠 ⋅ ∑ 𝑐𝑅
𝑚=1
where
R - the value of the external stimulus at time nnn,
c - the weight of the influence of the external stimulus, characterizing its
significance for the individual,
s - the susceptibility coefficient, reflecting the individual's overall sensitivity to
external influences,
M - the number of factors contributing to state changes.
In its full form, the equation for extroversion as iteration can be written as:
𝐸(𝑛) = 𝐸(𝑛 − 1) + 𝑠 ⋅ ∑ 𝑐𝑅
𝑚=1
The component E(n−1) reflects the fact that the individual retains their current
state, accumulated from previous steps, highlighting the idea of the linear
accumulation of experience. The susceptibility coefficient s regulates how strongly the
individual responds to external stimuli. Higher values of s correspond to higher
inverted sensitivity. The summation of the product of the external stimulus and its
weight accounts for all the external stimuli acting at time n, weighted by their
significance. Summation over M implies that multiple distinct factors may contribute
to the change in state, each adding to the transition.
This equation describes extroversion as a process of accumulating external
experience, which is consistent with classical views on the social and cognitive aspects
of extroverted behavior. Its structure reflects the key properties of extroversion, such
as the linear accumulation of experience, dependence on the external environment,
and individual differences in sensitivity to stimuli.
Extroversion is analogous to the process of learning—an individual
accumulates external stimuli and updates their state on the basis of their significance
and strength.
3.3. Ambiversion as Transitivity
Ambiversion is not merely a transitional state between introversion and
extroversion. It is an independent balanced state characterized by an individual's
ability to adapt to internal conditions and external environments, which can be
entirely synergistic.
This balanced state, in its simplest representation, can be interpreted through
the influence of two factors:
1. Proportional influence of introversion and extroversion. An individual
integrates internal analysis through introversion I(n) and external influences
through extroversion E(n).
2. Synergy of processes. The interaction between introversion and extroversion
enhances overall adaptability, creating a nonlinear influence of both factors.
In ambiversion, introversion and extroversion coexist in a specific proportion.
Therefore, a proportionality coefficient γ can be introduced, which represents the
relative weights of introversion and extroversion within the individual. Using γ, the
expression for ambiversion A(n) can be written as a transitive function:
𝐴(𝑛) = 𝛾 𝐼(𝑛) + (1 − 𝛾)𝐸(𝑛)
where
γ∈[0,1] - proportionality coefficient regulating the dominance of one process
over the other.
The coefficient γ describes the "tuning" of the individual at a given moment in
time. The personality may lean toward introversion, extroversion, or a mixed state.
When γ=1, the individual's state is entirely determined by introversion. When γ=0,
the state is fully defined via extroversion. Intermediate values of γ reflect a mixed
influence of both processes.
This introvert–extrovert balance is a linear combination of the two processes.
Using a distant analogy, this is not the case for Jekyll and Hyde, which exist separately,
sequentially, and at different times. Ambiversion is a case where Jekyll and Hyde
coexist simultaneously and proportionally within the individual. Ambiversion is not a
disorder; it is an inherent property of personality.
The interaction of these two processes (introversion and extroversion) reflects
the principles of synergy in complex systems, where the interaction of components
leads to new systemic properties.
The synergistic transitivity of ambiversion is interpreted through adaptive
behavior arising from the simultaneous interaction of introversion and extroversion.
Accordingly, the equation of synergistic transitivity is defined as:
𝑇(𝑛) = 𝛿 ⋅ 𝜙 ⋅ 𝐼(𝑛) ⋅ 𝐸(𝑛)
where:
δ - synergy coefficient describing the strength of interaction between the
processes and its impact on the individual's overall state.
ϕ - interaction amplification parameter, reflecting the intensity of the mutual
influence between introversion and extroversion. This component introduces
nonlinearity into the model, accounting for effects such as increased
adaptability when both processes are at high levels and a reduced influence of
one process if the other is weakened.
By combining the linear balance γ and the transitive component δ⋅ϕ, the final
expression for ambiversion A(n) becomes:
𝐴(𝑛) = 𝛾 ⋅ 𝐼(𝑛) + (1 − 𝛾) ⋅ 𝐸(𝑛) + 𝛿 ⋅ 𝜙 ⋅ 𝐼(𝑛) ⋅ 𝐸(𝑛)
In this ambiversion equation, the synergistic component δ⋅ϕ adds nonlinearity,
enhancing the individual's adaptive properties when both processes (introversion and
extroversion) are at high levels. For example, when an individual simultaneously
analyses internal experiences and responds to external stimuli, the interaction
between these processes creates a new quality.
Thus, the equation for ambiversion as transitivity is derived from the a priori
assumption that an individual integrates two opposing processes—introversion and
extroversion—in a specific proportion and amplifies their interaction through a
synergistic effect. It describes not only the basic balance between internal and external
processes but also their adaptive interaction, making it suitable for modelling the
flexibility and complexity of an individual in changing conditions and in applications
that simulate psychological archetypes.
3.4. Integration
Combining recursive introversion, iterative extroversion, and transitive
ambiversion, the comprehensive model of an individual's psychological archetype can
be expressed as:
𝑃(𝑛) = 𝐼(𝑛) + 𝐸(𝑛) + 𝐴(𝑛)
or more explicitly:
𝐷−1
𝑃(𝑛) = 𝑘 (𝐼(𝑛 − 1, 𝐷)) + 𝑤 ⋅ ∑ 𝐼(𝑛, 𝑑) + 𝐸(𝑛 − 1) +
𝑑=1
+ 𝑠 ⋅ ∑ 𝑐𝑅 + 𝛾 ⋅ 𝐼(𝑛) + (1 − 𝛾) ⋅ 𝐸(𝑛) + 𝛿 ⋅ 𝜙 ⋅ 𝐼(𝑛) ⋅ 𝐸(𝑛)
𝑚=1
Recursive introversion contributes to exponential growth because of its
nonlinear component (m>1). The balance between depth (D) and the influence of
lower levels (w) stabilizes the process. External factors ensure the linear
accumulation of new experiences, which defines extroversion. The transitive
component (δ⋅ϕ) enhances the interaction between internal and external processes,
increasing adaptability.
This model integrates internal and external processes, offering the flexibility
and adaptability necessary to understand the complex structure of human behavior
and self-awareness. Recursion, iteration, and transitivity serve as metaphors that
reflect profound internal processes, external interactions, and their integration.
This model promotes a deeper understanding of personality, adaptability, and
growth potential, providing a foundation for further research and practical
applications in psychology, sociology, and related sciences. It is particularly relevant
for algorithmic implementations of psychological archetypes in artificial neural
networks and large language models.
4. Discussion
We introduced three key processes: introversion as recursion, extroversion as
iteration, and ambiversion as transitivity. These processes were formalized through
mathematical expressions, enabling a transition from qualitative description to
quantitative analysis.
The presented archetypal model is based on the simple thesis that an individual
is a complex dynamic system. Introversion, extroversion, and ambiversion are
interpreted and interact through recursive, iterative, and transitive processes,
respectively. This approach characterizes the individual not as a mechanical set of
static traits but as a system capable of dynamic self-reflection, adaptation, and
expansion.
The recursive component I(n,D) describes the process of profound self-
awareness and reinterpretation of internal experience. The expression for I(n,D)
enables a quantitative evaluation of how previous states influence the current state,
considering the nonlinearity of the process (m>1) and the interplay between different
levels of self-awareness depth (w).
High values of k and m lead to the exponential growth of introverted processes,
reflecting intensive internal analysis and active self-development. In real life, the
process of self-awareness and self-reflection often leads to internal deepening and
rethinking of past experiences, which frequently results in qualitative changes in
one’s perception of self and the world.
The nonlinearity of this process illustrates that small changes in perception or
behavior can result in significantly larger shifts in personal dynamics.
The iterative component E(n) reflects the accumulation of external influences
and the expansion of external interactions. The formula for E(n) demonstrates how
external factors and their weights affect the state of extroversion. The susceptibility
coefficient regulates the degree of an individual's reaction to external stimuli.
This is analogous to the linear accumulation of external experience, enabling
individuals to broaden their horizons through sequential steps of interaction with the
external ecosystem.
The iterative nature of extroversion signifies a linear process of accumulating
new external data, which nonetheless plays a vital role in adapting the individual to
changing environmental conditions. In a psychological context, this aligns with the
concept of social adaptation, where a person accumulates new social interactions,
experiences, and impressions.
Ambiversion, represented by A(n), integrates both internal (introversion) and
external (extroversion) processes, balancing their influence through the
proportionality coefficient γ and amplifying their interaction via the synergistic term
δ⋅ϕ. This transitive component ensures adaptability and creates new systemic
properties that emerge from the interaction of opposing forces.
The combined model reflects the dynamic nature of personality and provides a
mathematical foundation for studying the flexibility and adaptability of individuals.
Its potential applications extend to psychology, artificial intelligence, and the
simulation of human-like behavior in technological systems.
The ambivert component A(n) is interpreted through a transitive function
integrating introversion and extroversion. The parameters γ and δ⋅ϕ regulate the
balance between introversion, extroversion, and their synergy. This component
provides flexibility, allowing the individual to adapt to changing conditions and find
an optimal equilibrium between internal analysis and external interactions.
In a psychological context, this corresponds to a higher level of adaptability and
the ability of an individual to balance various aspects of their existence.
High values of γ (closer to 1) - the psychological archetype leans toward
introversion, which may result in reduced external interactions and increased
inwards focus. Low values of γ (closer to 0) - extrovert processes dominate,
promoting active engagement with the external ecosystem. The transitivity
parameter δ⋅ϕ reflects the individual's dynamic adaptability, enabling transitions
between introverted and extroverted modes depending on the current conditions.
High transitivity values correspond to flexible transitions, preventing extremes and
maintaining stable balance.
The presence of nonlinearity (m>1) in the recursive component of introversion
introduces complex dynamic effects into the model. This allows the psychological
archetype system to exhibit exponential growth of introverted processes under stable
external conditions, corresponding to intensive internal analysis and self-
development.
The iterative component of extroversion E(n) interprets the linear
accumulation of external influences. This means that individuals can expand their
experience and interactions with the external ecosystem.
The combined effect of recursion and iteration, mediated by the transitive
component, generates complex dynamic patterns. This includes the possibility of
attractors and chaotic regimes under certain parameter combinations. Psychological
or archetypal attractors represent a separate topic; understanding how trajectories of
archetypes change or attract allows exploration of more complex interactions
between recursive, iterative, and transitive properties of psychological archetypes.
The proposed model significantly differs from traditional approaches to
studying personality, such as Big Five theory or Jung’s typologies, which focus on
static traits. In contrast, this model views personality as a dynamic system capable of
change and adaptation through the interaction of internal and external processes.
It enables an interpretation of an individual's dynamism, describing changes
over time by considering both internal reflective processes and external stimuli.
Additionally, the model integrates processes by unifying introversion, extroversion,
and ambiversion into a single system, demonstrating their interconnections and
mutual influences.
Overall, this model provides a quantitative description of individual dynamics
as a first approximation, allowing predictive analysis and process optimization for
personality development.
Naturally, this model is relatively primitive and thus limited. More precise
definitions and parameter adjustments based on large empirical datasets are needed.
A rigorous validation process is needed, relying on real-world data obtained from
long-term studies and comprehensive psychological measurements. The development
of recursive, iterative, and ambitious computational models for interpreting
psychological archetypes is a complex task.
Hypothetical practical applications:
Personal balance assessment and correction—The model can be used to assess
and adjust an individual's personality balance. For example, a client with dominant
introversion might focus on developing social skills. A person with excessive
extroversion could work to enhance self-reflection.
Educational environment—the model could help design individual learning
strategies tailored to the dominant processes of a student’s personality. For example,
introverted students might benefit more from independent projects. Extroverted
students might perform better in group assignments.
The corporate environment model could assist in evaluating employees'
personality profiles and assigning optimal roles within teams. For example, introverts
could focus on analytical tasks. Extroverts could excel in client-facing roles.
This model, which offers a mathematical description of personality dynamics
through recursion, iteration, and transitivity, provides promising tools for analysing,
predicting, and optimizing personality changes. Unlike traditional static models, it
dynamically describes personality as a self-developing system capable of deep
adaptation and flexibility.
Despite existing limitations, the model has significant potential for scientific
research into archetype algorithmization in AI environments and practical
applications in psychotherapy, coaching, education, and personnel management.
Future studies aimed at empirical validation and model expansion will make
this method even more universal and precise.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, we summarize the findings and implications of this study:
The models are based on comprehensive theoretical concepts from psychology,
complex systems theory, and the cognitive sciences. Introversion, extroversion,
and ambiversion have been translated from qualitative concepts into
quantitative parameters through logical algorithms, enabling the study of their
interactions and mutual influences.
The developed models of introversion as recursion, extroversion as iteration,
and ambiversion as transitivity represent tools, algorithms, and paradigms for
describing individual dynamics. Introversion is not merely a tendency toward
inner reflection but also a dynamic process of deepening experience.
Introversion, interpreted as a recursive process, describes profound inner
reflection that is dependent on accumulated experience.
Extroversion is formalized as an iterative accumulation of external influences,
and extroversion represents the sequential interaction of an individual with the
external environment. It involves not only social activity but also systematic
interaction with external stimuli.
Ambiversion is mathematically expressed as a synergistic interaction of these
processes, and ambiversion provides flexibility and adaptability in changing
conditions. It is not a static intermediate state but an active integration of two
processes.
The model accounts for nonlinear effects, such as the exponential influence of
internal experience (m>1) or the synergistic effect of introversion–extroversion
interactions (δ⋅ϕ).
Interaction between depth levels (D) ensures multilayered dynamics, reflecting
the complex nature of personality.
The introduction of parameters γ, δ, ϕ, w and s allows the model to adapt to a
wide range of individual profiles and situations.
The model is capable of approximating extreme states (pure introversion or
extroversion) as well as the balanced state of ambiversion.
The model can be used for diagnosing and adjusting personality balance. For
example, individuals with dominant introversion can be guided to utilize more
external resources, and extroverts can focus on developing internal reflection.
The model supports the adaptation of teaching methods to individual
characteristics, optimizing the learning process by accounting for personal
predispositions; introverted students may benefit more from independent
projects, and extroverted students might thrive in group-based assignments.
The model allows for assessing employee personality profiles and selecting
optimal roles in teams. For example, introverts might excel in analytical tasks,
and extroverts could succeed in client-facing roles.
Practical application of the model requires validation with real-world data.
Research and testing using psychological methods are necessary.
The model does not yet account for emotional, cognitive, and cultural factors,
which can significantly impact personality.
Research is needed to calibrate model parameters on the basis of data from
psychological testing.
The model can be extended to include additional processes, such as emotional
dynamics, cognitive aspects, or the influence of social factors.
Creating software for visualizing and analysing personality dynamics on the
basis of this model is essential. Additionally, the model can be expanded to
describe group and collective dynamics.
Models based on recursion, iteration, and transitivity describe personality as a
dynamic and multilayered system where internal and external processes
interact and evolve over time.
The full, expanded model integrates introversion, extroversion, and
ambiversion into a single dynamic system capable of describing a wide
spectrum of personality states, from introversion to full social activity, with
adaptive mechanisms.
The formalization presented here can be implemented in programmatic
algorithms, enabling the creation of functional procedures for AI and robots
with differentiated psychological archetypes (introvert robots, extrovert
robots, and ambivert robots).
