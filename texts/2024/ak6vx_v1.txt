Abstract
Personality and psychopathology share a hierarchical dimensional structure, developmental
trajectories and correlations with varied outcomes. However, quantifying the extent and details
of their direct empirical overlap has been hindered by over-reliance on self-reports and broad
construct domains. Using multi-method data, we estimated the Big Five personality domains’
and nuances’ (items’) “true” correlations (r ) with, and true predictive accuracy (r ) for,
true truePRED
various psychopathology state domains, free of single-method and occasion-specific biases,
random error, and direct content overlap. Our sample included Estonian Biobank participants (N
= 16,226) who completed psychopathology and comprehensive personality questionnaires, and
whose personality traits were also rated by close informants. Personality nuances out-predicted
the Big Five domains for psychopathology, with items’ r = 0.31…0.58 for specific
truePRED
psychopathology domains of distress, fear, inattention, hyperactivity, insomnia and fatigue, and
r = 0.52 for the general p-factor. Individual items had various meaningful r s with the
truePRED true
psychopathology domains. Among the Big Five, neuroticism was the strongest correlate of
distress (r = 0.29) and fear (r = 0.13), while inattention was most correlated with
true true
conscientiousness (r = –0.56), hyperactivity with extraversion (r = 0.25), fatigue with
true true
openness (r = 0.12), and insomnia with conscientiousness (r = 0.12). Associations based
true true
on self-reports alone were weaker. We argue for multi-rater and finer-grained assessments of
both personality and psychopathology to fully reveal the extent and details of their overlap. This
association is likely stronger than typical self-report data suggest, yet psychopathology is not
empirically redundant with personality traits.

General Scientific Summary
Personality traits and mental health problems are treated as intertwined yet distinct concepts,
with the former ostensibly more and the latter less stable. This study suggests that if we account
for people’s biases in reporting on their personality and mental health by combining self- and
informant-reports and map personality comprehensively, personality traits and psychopathology
overlap more strongly than typical single-method-studies show. Yet, they are not redundant.
1. Introduction
Personality research primarily focuses on adaptive and presumably more stable processes within
and differences among people, while psychopathology research usually addresses non-adaptive
and ostensibly more temporary processes. Yet, they overlap empirically and conceptually
(Hopwood et al., 2022; Andersen & Bienvenu, 2011), although the overlap’s full extent and
details remain unclear. We argue that accurately describing it requires comprehensive multi-rater
data that allows controlling for systematic biases and random error and considering the
associations’ details. Here, we combined multiple assessment methods to estimate correlations
between various personality traits – domains and nuances – and psychopathology constructs –
internalizing psychopathology domains as well as inattention and hyperactivity symptoms – and
to calculate the multivariate predictive accuracy of personality traits for psychopathology. We
used data from 16,226 biobank participants whose Big Five personality domains and nuances
were rated by themselves and their informants, and who rated their psychopathology symptoms.
1.1 Shared basis of personality and psychopathology
Personality psychology has coalesced around the Five-Factor Model (FFM) to describe normally
distributed individual differences in the general population (McCrae & John, 1992), while
psychopathology has often been treated as a set of discrete and thresholded disorder categories
(Hyman, 2010). However, many argue that this categorical view of psychopathology should be
replaced by a personality-like hierarchical dimensional approach to account for the (co-
)occurrence of symptoms, syndromes, vulnerabilities and maintenance factors (Fried & Nesse,
2015; Chmielewski et al., 2015).
This alone shows how personality and psychopathology are similar. The FFM describes
individual differences as a hierarchy, with five broad domains – neuroticism, extraversion,
agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to experience – composed of lower-level facets
that are, in turn, made up of nuances – the most specific personality traits, often indexed by
single items (McCrae, 2015; Mõttus et al., 2017). Dimensional psychopathology models are
similarly hierarchical, with spectra-level constructs like internalizing and externalizing made up
of more specific subfactors, syndromes, and symptoms (Kotov et al., 2017; Caspi et al., 2014).
For example, in the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology, the internalizing spectrum
comprises subfactors of fear, distress, eating pathology and sexual problems, which encompass
specific symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety (Kotov et al., 2017). Some have also
postulated a general p-factor of psychopathology to account for the constructs’ shared variance
(Caspi et al., 2014; Laceulle et al., 2015), while others question its meaningfulness (Watts et al.,
2023).
Similarities between personality and psychopathology extend beyond their structure (Widiger et
al., 2019; Rosenström et al., 2019). First, the FFM dimensions’ extremes align with personality
pathology, e.g., high neuroticism relates to emotional instability, low conscientiousness to
disinhibition and low agreeableness to antisocial tendencies (Andersen & Bienvenu, 2011; for a
discussion of FFM’s alignment with categorical personality disorders, see Samuel & Widiger,
2008). Second, while common forms of psychopathology, like depression, anxiety disorders and
substance use disorders, have traditionally been considered state-based disturbances, they also
reflect relatively stable personality trait-like continua (Markon et al., 2005; Sellbom et al., 2020).
Moreover, while “state disturbances” can persist over time (anorexia nervosa, Davis et al., 2020;
depression, Kivelä et al., 2023), “trait disturbances” can be alleviated (Wright et al., 2015;
Roberts et al., 2017). Likewise, personality is often modelled in terms of both state- and trait-
components (Sosnowska et al., 2020). In fact, in direct rank-order stability comparisons, some
psychopathology symptoms appear only slightly less stable than personality traits (Goldstein et
al., 2022). Therefore, personality and psychopathology cannot be distinguished based on their
temporal patterns (Hopwood et al., 2022). Third, personality traits, personality disorders, and
common mental health disorders share genetic (Sanchez-Roige et al., 2018; Lo et al., 2017;
Polushina et al., 2021) and neuroanatomical (Hyatt et al., 2019) correlates. Fourth, there are
similarities in their normative developmental trajectories with most changes appearing in young
adulthood (Morey & Hopwood, 2013; Oldehinkel & Ormel, 2023).
1.2 Underpinnings and extent of shared variance
Various mutually non-exclusive theories can account for these similarities. Certain personality
traits could dispose people to develop psychopathology (vulnerability model), or
psychopathology could leave a mark on one’s personality (scar model). Alternatively,
personality and psychopathology could share etiological roots (common cause model), or reflect
a joint continuum (spectrum model; Krueger & Tackett, 2003; Tackett, 2006). According to all
these models, personality and psychopathology dimensions should be correlated to some extent,
but only the spectrum model postulates near-perfect empirical overlap between the constructs.
Empirical evidence regarding the overlap is mixed. For example, when a general personality
factor (GFP) is related to a general p-factor of psychopathology, associations range widely
between r = |0.43…0.87|, likely due to assessment and modelling choices (Oltmanns et al., 2018;
Littlefield et al., 2021; van der Linden et al., 2021). As for specific personality and
psychopathology domains, average correlations between FFM domains and common mental
disorders ranged between r = –0.02…0.39 in a meta-analysis by Kotov and colleagues (2010),
with the strongest associations for neuroticism (r = 0.28…0.49). FFM domains have shown to be
correlated with specific personality disorders at a very similar magnitude (r = 0.02…0.30), with
neuroticism demonstrating the strongest links (Samuel & Widiger, 2008). In later studies, the
neuroticism-psychopathology association has emerged consistently, although with varied
magnitude: from near-perfect (neuroticism and internalizing psychopathology, r = 0.98 in
Griffith et al., 2010), to somewhat (e.g. neuroticism and depression, r = 0.34 in Yoon, 2013) or
much (e.g. neuroticism and internalizing psychopathology, r = 0.17… 0.23; Watts et al., 2019)
weaker overlap. Studies of other psychopathology and FFM domains are fewer, but similarly
mixed. For example, conscientiousness was strongly correlated with anhedonia (r = –0.53),
depressivity (r = –0.52) and distractibility (r = –0.63) in Watson and Clark (2020) and more
weakly in other studies (e.g., with p at r = –0.25 in Castellanos-Ryan et al., 2016; with
internalizing at r = 0.01…–0.10 and externalizing at r = –0.25…–0.28 in Watts et al., 2019,
depending on the measurement model).
1.3 Why these associations may be misrepresented
Two common methodological issues could explain why evidence regarding the empirical overlap
between personality traits and psychopathology is inconsistent and potentially misleading. First,
representing the associations using broad personality and psychopathology constructs may be
uninformative or even spurious. For example, links with general psychopathology factors might
offer limited explanatory value due to being driven by any number of their component constructs
(Smith et al., 2020; Watts et al., 2023). Likewise, constituent traits of the FFM domains often
vary in links with other variables (Stewart et al., 2022), making the findings difficult to interpret
(Mõttus, 2016). For example, only one or a few neuroticism facets might tack internalizing
disorders (depression facet in Lyon et al., 2020; depression and vulnerability in Hayne et al.,
2022). Moreover, facets can have more varied correlations across psychopathology domains,
offering greater specificity for differential diagnoses. For instance, in Walton et al. (2018),
neuroticism was related to substance use, distress and fear dimensions at r = 0.30…0.49, while
facet-level correlations ranged between r = 0.16…0.51; agreeableness was related to distress at r
= –0.09 but its facet trust was correlated with distress at r = –0.28. Lower-level analyses can also
differentiate personality disorder features, for example a r = 0.04 correlation between antisocial
personality disorder and extraversion masked stronger negative (r = –0.13 for warmth) and
positive (r = 0.25 for excitement seeking) associations with extraversion’s facets (Samuel &
Widiger, 2008). Further, even facets might conceal meaningful variability in how their
constituent nuances are associated with psychopathology (Hang et al., 2023).
Second, while many studies investigating the overlap between personality and psychopathology
rely exclusively on self-report measures, others use clinicians’ diagnoses. Both designs have
problems. Valid personality assessments transcend a single perspective (McCrae et al., 2019,
Wiedenroth et al., 2024): trait measurements should capture the “true” trait score as they exist
independently of particular sources of information. Besides random error, stable respondent-
specific biases can skew their answers systematically across all (e.g., response styles) or some
specific constructs (e.g., idiosyncratic item or trait interpretations; McCrae, 2018; McCrae &
Mõttus, 2019), thereby distorting constructs’ correlations. Comparing test-retest reliability (how
much people agree with themselves) and cross-method correlations (how much others agree with
them) shows that single-method biases can account for approximately 40% of self-report
variance (McCrae, 2018, McCrae et al., 2019). While some of this may represent information
uniquely available to one rater, stable rater-specific biases like response style and item
interpretations likely account for most of it (McCrae et al., 1998). Psychopathology measures are
subject to the same biases (Pavlova & Uher, 2020). Moreover, state effects (e.g. fatigue, mood,
pain) can impact all self-reports, creating spurious correlations (Podsakoff et al., 2012). So,
correlations observed in (cross-sectional or otherwise) single-method studies may either
substantially overestimate personality-psychopathology overlap (e.g., due to shared rating biases)
or underestimate them (e.g., due to random error or idiosyncratic item interpretations).
Moreover, the notoriously low reliability of clinical diagnoses (Levin-Aspenson, 2023) can
further contribute to attenuated associations with personality traits and inconsistencies across
studies.
These issues can only be addressed by “triangulating” multiple assessment methods of the same
constructs that don’t share biases and errors (Mõttus et al., 2024). For personality traits, the most
readily available, face-valid and scalable assessment method to complement self-reports is
ratings by knowledgeable informants such as partners, friends or close relatives. There is no
systematic evidence that informant-reports are less valid than self-reports, and independent raters
are unlikely to share many of the biases that plague single-method assessments (Connelly &
Ones, 2010; Mõttus et al., 2024). For psychopathology, informant-reports on adults are typically
limited to clinician assessments. However, if knowledgeable informants are instructed to assess
observable manifestations of pathology, instead of providing evaluations of diagnostic criteria,
they have also been found to meaningfully supplement self-reports, providing an account of
psychopathology that goes beyond diagnostic categories (van der Ende et al., 2021).
1.4 Current study
In this large, multi-trait, multi-informant study, we assessed the extent to which personality and
psychopathology overlap by calculating true correlations (r ) between various personality traits
true
and internalizing psychopathology constructs. We used a sample of 16,226 individuals who,
besides assessing their psychopathology states, rated their personality domains and nuances and
were rated by a knowledgeable informant for these same traits a few months later.
Specifically, we calculated correlations of informant-reported personality traits with self-rated
psychopathology. These cross-method correlations were not inflated by common-to-traits single-
method and occasion-specific biases; however, they were attenuated by random measurement
error and trait-and rater-specific biases (Mõttus et al., 2024). But since personality traits’ self-
informant correlations were similarly attenuated by these same factors, these could be used to
correct the cross-method correlations, so that the resultant correlations would reflect the
constructs error- and bias-free correlations (Schmidt & Hunter, 1996; Mõttus et al., 2017; Mõttus
et al., 2024).
We considered the Big Five personality domains to ensure robustness and comparability with
other studies as well as personality nuances, measured via single items, to avoid the domains’
ambiguities and ensure a comprehensive mapping of traits. For these same reasons, we also
modelled psychopathology at two levels of abstraction, the p-factor that captured poor mental
health generally (albeit being tilted towards internalizing pathology) and domain factors that
captured its details.
We also assessed the overall extents to which psychopathology could be (out-of-sample)
predicted from personality domains and nuances, controlling for error and single-method biases.
While the r s between individual constructs showed the personality-psychopathology overlap’s
true
details, the predictive approach provided estimates of the overlap’s full extent.
2. Method
2.1 Participants
Data were collected in Estonian Biobank’s (EstBB) Personality Study (PS; November 2021 to
March 2022) and Mental Health Online Survey (MHoS; March–July 2021; Ojalo et al., 2024).
The activities of the EstBB are regulated by the Human Genes Research Act, which was adopted
in 2000 specifically for the operations of the EstBB. Individual level data analysis in the EstBB
was carried out under ethical approval 1.1-12/626, 13.04.2020 granted by the Estonian
Committee on Bioethics and Human Research (Estonian Ministry of Social Affairs), using data
according to release application 3-10/GI/11571 from the EstBB.
In this study, we merged the PS and MHoS datasets to include participants who responded in
Estonian and had psychopathology and self- and informant-reported personality data (≤ 10
missing responses in any set of ratings), arriving at a final sample of N = 16,226. Participants’
mean age was M = 46.13 (SD = 13.76; range 19–91), 69.9% were assigned female sex at
age age
education were over-represented in the sample; more details on sample composition and how we
empirically mitigated imbalances are described in Supplementary Material 1.
2.2 Measures
2.2.1. Psychopathology. Current psychopathology was assessed via items of two self-report
questionnaires, the Emotional State Questionnaire-2 (EST-Q2; Aluoja et al., 1999; Ööpik et al.,
2006) and the modified Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS, Kessler et al., 2005; Ojalo et al.,
2024).
First, the EST-Q2 is a 28-item questionnaire with six subscales: depression, agoraphobia-panic,
anxiety, social phobia, fatigue and insomnia; symptom occurrence is rated over a one-month-
period and on a 5-point-scale. As such, the EST-Q2 mostly covers internalizing
psychopathology. It is a generally applicable measure of current mental health, with the assessed
symptoms widely endorsed beyond clinical samples and varying dimensionally among the
Estonian population (Laidra et al., 2023). In this study, we replicated the questionnaire’s original
factor structure, and its subscales had adequate internal consistency (α = 0.76…0.91).
Second, the modified ASRS is a 6-item measure to tap the DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. Items are
rated on a 5-point-scale based on symptom occurrence over the past 6 months (Kessler et al.,
2005). The measure was adapted into Estonian within MHoS (Ojalo et al., 2024) and had good
psychometric properties in our sample (one-factor structure, α = 0.75). While this screener is
insufficient for comprehensively capturing all externalizing psychopathology, we included it to
expand our psychopathology coverage beyond internalizing issues.
To empirically identify psychopathology domains, we performed hierarchical exploratory
bifactor analyses with Schmid-Leiman transformations (bifactor model; Revelle & Wilt, 2013;
Bonifay et al., 2017). For comparability with previous work not relying on bifactor models, we
extracted an exploratory model with obliquely rotated factors, using the algorithm developed by
ten Berge and colleagues (correlated-factors model; ten Berge et al., 1999). The p-factor was
obtained from the bifactor model (bifactor p), but we also developed a single-factor non-
hierarchical p for reference (single-factor p) by extracting a one-factor ten Berge solution.
2.2.2. Personality. Personality traits were assessed with the 198-item 100 Nuances of Personality
(100-NP; Henry & Mõttus, 2022). It was developed based on items from the International
Personality Item Pool (Goldberg, 1999) and the Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment
(Condon, 2017). The 100-NP aims to comprehensively, reliably and non-redundantly capture
traits represented in the FFM, HEXACO and Dark Triad and beyond (e.g., envy, humour,
sexuality, competitiveness; Henry & Mõttus, 2022). Items were selected based on iterative
empirical testing, preferring non-redundant items with high retest reliability and variance and
low social desirability (Henry & Mõttus, 2022). Response validity of both self- and informant-
ratings was tested through self-informant correlations of the respective 198-item response
profiles: the z-transformed profile correlations were close-to-normally distributed, with a Mdn =
th th th th th th
0.66 (5 , 10 , 25 , 75 , 90 , and 95 percentiles: 0.33, 0.40, 0.53, 0.79, 0.90, 0.97). A
substantial proportion of poor-quality responses from either participants or their informants
would have resulted in left-heavier distribution.
We excluded 39 100-NP items that overlapped with other items at the personality pool at r ≥
true
|0.75|, 14 items that overlapped with psychopathology items (r ≥ |0.75| and direct semantic
true
convergence), and seven items assessing general or domain-specific life satisfaction (Mõttus et
al., 2024). This left us with 138 items (Supplementary Material 2) that we took to capture
nuance-level variability within and beyond the Big Five domains.
To derive Big Five scores, we used domain estimates calculated for all 20,886 EstBB PS
participants by Anni and colleagues (2024) based on 100-NP items. Domains were composed by
(a) averaging standardized self- and informant-ratings of participants who had no more than 10
missing responses for personality items; (b) dropping the item with less variance from each pair
correlating above 0.50 and dropping items with no correlation with any other item at least 0.30;
(c) running PCA in the remaining 119 items, extracting five varimax-rotated components and
retaining 12 highest-loading items for each component; (d) re-running PCA with the remaining
60 items and using the resulting varimax-rotated loading matrix to calculate participants’ Big
Five scores in self-reports and informant-reports. Here, included items were not filtered based on
semantic overlap with psychopathology, to ensure a substantial conceptualization of the Big
Five. This computation procedure ensured that Big Five scores were relatively orthogonal;
similarly calculated in self- and informant-reports; and based on diverse but not loose item
content. The components’ item loadings resembled typical Big Five content; they explained
37%, 42% and 44% of items’ variance in self-, informant and combined ratings, respectively,
and their cross-rater correlations were 0.45…0.59 and test-retest reliabilities 0.85…0.88. They
correlated highly with several other scales designed to measure the Big Five and had meaningful
correlations with a range of criterion variables (Anni et al., 2024). This evidence attests to the
scores’ reliability and construct validity.
2.3 Data analysis
2.3.1 True correlations
Following Mõttus and colleagues (2024; algebraic proof in Supplementary Material), we
calculated r as the ratio between two correlations: (a) the correlation between self-reported
true
psychopathology and informant-reported personality trait, and (b) the correlation between the
self- and informant-rated personality trait. These calculations rest on the reasonable assumption
that (a) arises from informants rating targets’ personality traits per se and not directly their
psychopathology states (which were assessed a few months earlier through self-ratings) and
therefore (a) represents (consensually) valid parts of personality trait variance correlating with
psychopathology. If so, the correlations between personality traits and psychopathology
dimensions were bounded by the amount of (consensually) valid variance in the constructs’
assessments. To adjust for that, we assumed (b) to represent the amount of consensually valid
information for both personality traits and psychopathology dimensions. The former was correct
by definition, while the latter was an assumption justified by a pilot study of 294 people (M =
age
30.21, SD = 11.91; 73.46% self-identified as women) who completed psychopathology items
age
themselves and were also rated by an informant. Cross-rater correlations for psychopathology
items ranged between 0.07…0.36 (Mdn = 0.23) and the correlation for a single-factor p was r =
0.43. These correlations are somewhat smaller but comparable to those of personality items
(Mdn = 0.30) and domains (Mdn = 0.51). Ideally, we would have included informant-reports of
psychopathology, allowing the r numerator to also contain the correlation of self-reported
true
personality traits with informant-reported psychopathology and denominator to also contain
cross-rater correlations for psychopathology. Still, this would have been unlikely to change
results much, as it similarly influences both the numerator and denominator and made little
difference for life satisfaction as a correlate of personality traits (Mõttus et al., 2024).
We calculated r s between personality items (markers of nuances) and domains on the one hand
true
and psychopathology domains and p-factor on the other hand; we also report respective single-
method correlations for reference. Standard errors were calculated as per Mõttus et al. (2024).
Since r s are error-free, they are directly comparable for items and domains.
true
2.3.2 True predictive accuracy
To predict self-reported psychopathology from informant-reported personality traits, we divided
our data into training (67%) and testing (33%) subsamples and created a series of elastic net
regressions (alpha parameter set to 0.5; Zou & Hastie, 2005) using the glmnet R package
(Friedman et al., 2010). To find the best model for each set of outcomes (psychopathology
domains and p-factor) and predictors (personality domains or items), we trained the model with
10-fold cross-validation within the training sample, constraining the regularization strength
parameter lambda to a minimum (Zou & Hastie, 2005). For validation, we used the best-
performing model to predict the outcome variable in the validation sample, using the correlation
between the outcome’s predicted and observed values as a measure of prediction accuracy. We
repeated the procedure across 10 random training-validation splits for each outcome-predictor set
combination and averaged the respective prediction accuracies for more robust results (Yarkoni
& Westfall, 2021). To calculate true predictive accuracies (r ), we divided the cross-rater
truePRED
prediction accuracies by cross-rater agreement on the combination of personality traits used to
predict the respective psychopathology outcome, which was calculated by applying the
prediction model created in informant-reports to self-reports and correlating the predictions from
self- and informant-reports (Mõttus et al., 2024).
2.4. Transparency and openness
We have reported how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions, all manipulations, and
all measures in the study. PS and MHoS data are not publicly available due to being part of a
large ongoing EstBB study, but researchers can apply for access subject to an ethics board
registered. All analyses were carried out in R, version 4.3.1 (R Core Team, 2023), scripts are
available in an online repository (Soodla et al., 2024).
3. Results
Full results of main analyses are in Supplementary Material 3, with single-informant
comparisons presented in Supplementary Material 4. Largely similar findings on a
demographically more balanced subsample are reported in Supplementary Material 5.
3.1 Psychopathology models
Based on the Schmid-Leiman-rotated bifactor algorithm, a 6-factor solution of psychopathology
data fit best based on interpretability, a drop in eigenvalues, and favourable fit indices compared
h t
six domain-level factors: distress, fear, fatigue, insomnia, hyperactivity, and inattention. The
correlations ranging from 0.21 to 0.69, being highest for distress and fatigue; we retained factor
scores for further analyses. Additionally, we fit an exploratory non-hierarchical single-factor
model and saved factor scores.

3.1.True correlations between personality items and psychopathology
from r = |0.22| to |0.58| and being, on average, strongest for inattention, followed by fear and
true
distress and the weakest for insomnia and fatigue. The strongest item-level correlations were
usually intuitive but not trivial. For the correlated-factors domains, the associations’ relative
pattern was similar, but correlations were higher, especially for the distress factor (four most
strongly associated items r > 0.60). For comparison, the self-report-only correlations between
true
personality items and psychopathology ranged between –0.37…0.37 and were, on average,
notably lower than r s.
true
Items were usually strongly associated with only one psychopathology domain, except for “Am
not embarrassed easily” that was a top correlate of both distress and fear. When we correlated the
z-transformed vectors of items’ r s with psychopathology, we also found the correlates of fear
true
and distress to be strongly associated (r = 0.62). The correlations-vector for inattention was
significantly inversely associated with that of insomnia (r = –0.62), and the vector for
hyperactivity with those of distress (r = –0.45) and fear (r = –0.66). However, near-zero
correlations arose for several domain pairs, e.g. fatigue and inattention, and insomnia and
distress. This shows that items offered discriminant validity for psychopathology domains
(median absolute correlation among the domain-item r vectors 0.13). For comparison,
true
psychopathology domains’ self-report personality correlates overlapped more, showing less
differentiation (median absolute correlation among domain-item correlation profiles 0.23).
Double-entry inter-class correlations (see McCrae, 2008; Furr, 2009) between domain-
personality item correlation vectors based on r s and single-method correlations ranged
true
between 0.43…0.65 (Mdn = 0.60).
embarrassed easily” (r = –0.59), “Often need help” (r = 0.58), “Need reassurance” (r =
true true true
0.49). Corresponding self-report-only correlations were lower, ranging between r = –0.24…0.35.
Five highest correlates of p were also highly correlated with distress and fear, items with strong
associations with other domains were less correlated with p, further underscoring items’
discriminant validity for psychopathology. Similar items emerged as top correlates of p under the
correlated-factors model, but associations were stronger, relative to bifactor domains.

only elastic net prediction: 0.24…0.55). Differences between the bifactor and correlated-factors
model were mostly marginal. We also tested r based on the top five mostly strongly
truePRED
correlated personality items for each bifactor domain and found that distress was predicted at
0.40 (SE = 0.02), fear at 0.33 (SE = 0.01), fatigue at 0.38 (SE = 0.02), insomnia at 0.24 (SE =
0.02), inattention at 0.57 (SE = 0.01) and hyperactivity at 0.46 (SE = 0.01). The r of
truePRED
personality items for the bifactor p was 0.52 and 0.80 for single-factor p. If only the top ten
highest correlated items were used as basis for predicting bifactor p, r remained 0.52 (SE
truePRED
= 0.01). Hence, much of the psychopathology-related personality trait variance could be
represented with only a few narrow traits.
3.4 True predictive accuracies of personality domains

0.09…0.48). While the predictability of inattention remained similar to item-based predictions,
the prediction accuracy for distress and fear was reduced by half and the overall predictive
accuracy of domains was significantly lower for most psychopathology factors. Predictions for
general factors showed less differences, with personality domains predicting bifactor p at
r = 0.49 and single-factor p at r = 0.76. Generally, thus, five personality items
truePRED truePRED
could provide comparable or even more accurate out-of-sample predictions than five broadly
defined personality domains.
4. Discussion
The hierarchical structure, content and development of personality traits and psychopathology
align but one key question has remained unanswered due to methodological limitations:
empirically, how much are they simply two sides of the same coin? Using a very large sample,
we quantified their true correlations and the overall predictability of psychopathology from
personality traits by triangulating personality trait self- and informant-ratings. The empirical
overlap estimates varied from r = 0…0.9, with three notable trends in their strengths and
true
patterns.
4.1. The overlap is larger…and smaller than previously estimated
First, accounting for methodological biases, personality items allowed predicting
psychopathology domains at Mdn = 0.45 and p at r = 0.52. These estimates
rtruePRED truePRED
exceeded the self-report-only estimates, suggesting that the typical findings based exclusively on
self-reports underestimate the personality trait-psychopathology overlap. For example, based on
single-method correlations, no Big Five domain correlated with insomnia, fatigue or fear at r ≥
0.10. Similarly, except for inattention, no psychopathology domain had item-level correlates r ≥
0.25 in self-report data.
Yet, unlike some previous studies, we did not to find the near-perfect overlap between
personality traits and p (Oltmanns et al., 2018; Southward et al., 2023) or neuroticism and
internalizing disorders (Griffith et al., 2010). The smaller estimates likely resulted from assessing
psychopathology and personality at a more detailed level and splitting facets of internalizing into
uncorrelated factors. While our (desirably) more orthogonal Big Five domains could reduce
inflated associations with psychopathology, the associations’ magnitudes were still comparable
to Kotov and colleagues’ (2010) meta-analysis and even surpassed some previous estimates
derived on bifactor (Castellanos-Ryan et al., 2016) and correlated-factors (Watts et al., 2019)
psychopathology models.
Although different methods and samples complicate direct comparisons among studies, our
results make one thing clear: single-method studies and lumping constructs together can result in
association magnitudes that are not replicable and stem from different methodological choices,
instead of true overlap between constructs.
4.2. Different domains of pathology have different personality correlates
Second, both overlap estimates and association patterns varied across psychopathology domains.
Although we found neuroticism to partly overlap with both distress and fear (Ormel et al., 2013;
Kotov et al., 2010, Griffith et al., 2010), and personality items associated with these domains
moderately coincided (r = 0.62 between correlation profiles), our results did not support
neuroticism as a single or even dominant correlate of psychopathology. Actually, the strongest,
most robust correlation pertained to conscientiousness and inattention, and this psychopathology
domain was predicted most accurately from all considered personality traits combined. Notably,
while Kotov et al. (2010) found controlling for neuroticism to limit association strengths with
conscientiousness, we showed strong correlations for near-orthogonal Big Five domains.
Additionally, hyperactivity overlapped the most with agreeableness, not neuroticism, and,
overall, personality correlates of hyperactivity were inversely related to those of distress and
fear. So, not all psychopathology has similar personality-level vulnerability factors. Personality
traits’ correlations with insomnia and fatigue remained lower, presumably because these are less
indicative of people’s stable psychological characteristics. Interestingly, while insomnia and
fatigue have also shown to be correlated, their personality-level correlates often showed inverse
relations (r = –0.27 between items’ correlation profiles; inverse association with domain-level
openness). So, personality-wise different people tend to report these conditions. Notably,
domains’ personality correlates’ uniqueness was comparably less pronounced when using only
self-report data.
In sum, these findings do not support p-factor as a particularly meaningful construct in relation to
broader psychological risk as captured by personality traits. Instead, different psychopathology
forms correspond to sufficiently and meaningfully distinct psychological traits. This has
implications for both future research and clinical applications, highlighting the benefits of using
lower-level psychopathology constructs, even if there is data analytic support for extracting
general factors. This, too, marks a similarity between psychopathology and personality (Mõttus,
2016).
4.3. Nuances are better predictors and offer more granular insights
Third, personality nuances predicted psychopathology more accurately than domains and
revealed meaningful associations with psychopathology. Top nuances had higher correlations
with pathology domains (Mdn = 0.40 across domains for top item-level correlates vs Mdn = 0.19
for top Big Five correlates) and median predictive accuracy increased from Mdn = 0.25 (domain
aggregate) to Mdn = 0.45 (item aggregate). Perhaps the best indicator of nuances’ benefits is that
median predictive accuracy for psychopathology domains only dropped by 13.3% when the pool
of 138 predictor items was limited to the five highest correlates for each pathology domain. So,
by using items like „Start tasks right away“, „Hardly ever finish things on time“, „Often stop
working if it becomes too hard“, „Avoid responsibilities“ and „Am always prepared“, inattention
was predicted at r = 0.56. This results in significantly more accurate predictions than
truePRED
based on the Big Five domains. Furthermore, the use of lower-level constructs highlighted
variety within one personality domain, such that some neuroticism items (e.g., “Worry about my
health”) did not correlate with distress at all (r < 0.01), while others (“Often feel that others
true
misunderstand me”) did. Additionally, some significant correlates of specific personality
domains, such as „Push myself very hard to succeed“ for hyperactivity, showed no association
with the p-factor.
This helps make sense of the interaction between psychopathology and personality. We found
that – controlling for methodological biases and using more comprehensive and detailed
measurements – there is substantial empirical overlap between psychopathology and personality
traits, but it is not perfect. So, personality traits and psychopathology appear not only
theoretically, but also empirically distinct (Rönkko & Cho, 2022), inconsistent with the spectrum
model. Moreover, some psychopathology domains were more like personality trait
manifestations than others. So, one pathology-personality model is likely insufficient for
describing this complexity (Ormel et al., 2013). Since substantial but non-perfect overlap can be
interpreted as evidence for the scar, vulnerability and common-cause models, other (e.g., genetic
or biomarker) data are required to test causal hypotheses. Moreover, intensive longitudinal data
could help compare nomothetic and idiographic models (Hopwood et al., 2022).
Limitations and future directions
While our study is unique with its large sample, multi-informant design and comprehensive
personality assessments, some limitations deserve attention. First, we indexed psychopathology
using measures that cover internalizing psychopathology and various ADHD symptoms. While
we believe these symptoms to represent prevalent mental disorders and allow addressing many
of the commonly postulated personality-psychopathology relationships, it is not clear that our
associations would replicate on externalizing and thought disorder features. This was illustrated
by both hyperactivity and inattention having divergent personality correlates compared to other,
more internalizing-specific domains. To assess the benefits of a wider psychopathology
coverage, indicators of, for example, antisocial behaviour, problematic substance use and/or
neurodevelopmental and/or psychotic disorders should be added, as these domains of
psychopathology might be differently related to personality compared to those indexed in our
study (e.g, agreeableness with antisocial behavior in Etkin et al., 2020; openness with thought
disorder symptoms in Begemann et al., 2020) or have more trait-like qualities based on the
duration and stability of symptoms or breadth of resulting impairments (Jacobsson et al., 2021,
Cicero et al., 2019). The limited psychopathology coverage also means that our p-factor was not
directly comparable to those based on different content (Watts et al., 2023).
Second, the associations’ generalizability should be tested cross-culturally, including in more
ethnically heterogenous samples. Previously, however, Mõttus and colleagues (2024) have
shown personality traits’ associations with life satisfaction – a personality correlate closely
related to psychopathology – to be reliably replicable across diverse samples, and the same
appears true for various other outcomes (Stewart et al., 2024).
Third, to increase clinical applicability and bridge categorical and dimensional accounts of
psychopathology, we suggest comparing continuously assessed psychopathology domains’
overlap with personality traits to that of specific psychopathology diagnoses.
Conclusions
We found that the overlap between presumably relatively stable personality traits and ostensibly
less stable psychopathology states is likely underestimated in typical self-report data.
Psychopathology was moderately to highly predictable from personality traits, and bias- and
error-free multi-informant correlations exceeded single-method associations. Moreover,
personality nuances out-predicted broader Big Five domains, and psychopathology domains had
distinct personality correlates, especially with nuances. For example, the item-nuance “Start
tasks right away” was highly correlated with inattention but showed weak associations with other
pathology domains; “Am usually active and full of energy” was a top correlate for both
hyperactivity and fatigue but in opposite directions. While our findings underscore strong
overlap between personality traits and psychopathology, psychopathology remains empirically
distinct from both broad and narrow personality traits.
