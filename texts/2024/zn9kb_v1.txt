Abstract
The mind constantly roves through the landscape of thought. Why does the mind spend so much time
wandering, daydreaming, ruminating, feeling, and spontaneously thinking? And what are the
consequences when the stream of thought runs astray? To answer these questions, much of prior work has
focused on the content of thought—what people think about when their mind is free to explore. This work
has identified several potential functions of spontaneous thought in the domains of memory, goal pursuit,
and emotion regulation. However, the content of spontaneous thought is only one piece of the puzzle. To
understand the functions of spontaneous thought, we also need to study the dynamics of thought—how
the mind jumps, near and far, fast and slow, with direction and at random. Advances in natural language
processing now allow researchers to track thought dynamics on ever larger behavioral datasets. We
propose that tracking the dynamics of thought opens new opportunities for understanding how and why
thought enables memory optimization, goal pursuit, and emotion regulation. We describe how to apply
approaches from computational modeling and network science to think-aloud data to test hypotheses
about the function of thought. Finally, we review how tracking thought dynamics can offer insight into
the maladaptive patterns that define clinical and affective disorders, and the adaptive patterns that
contribute to creativity. Broadly, this review offers an integrative, generative, and testable approach for
discovering new principles that govern how thought flows and discusses its practical applications in
mental health and creativity research.
As our bodies sit still, as we walk, as we work, eat, and socialize, our minds rarely sit still.
Instead, the human mind constantly roves through the landscape of thought. It wanders, daydreams,
ruminates, senses, feels—it engages in spontaneous thought. Why does the mind spend so much time
engaging in internal chatter?
Why do people think?
To answer this question, researchers have examined what people think about (Smallwood &
Schooler, 2015). The mind has a vast landscape of possible thoughts to visit. And yet, the mind reliably
drifts towards certain parts of the landscape more than others. The mind gravitates toward content that is
related to the self, personal goals, the social world, and happenings in the past or future (Andrews-Hanna
et al., 2013; Klinger, 2013; Klinger & Cox, 1987; Song & Wang, 2012). Understanding where the mind
stops as it moves through the vast landscape of thought could provide insight into why it moves in the
first place. For example, if people mostly think about recent experiences, this might suggest that thoughts
function to encode experiences into memory; if people constantly think about threats, this might suggest
that thoughts function to prepare people to ward off such threats.
The content of spontaneous thought only partly answers the question of why people think. There
is more to thought than where the mind lands. To understand the functions of spontaneous thought, we
also need to study the dynamics of thought—how the mind jumps, near and far, fast and slow, with
direction and at random from thought to thought. For example, a mind that helps people regulate negative
emotions might try to take quick, large steps away from negative thoughts and toward positive ones; a
mind that functions to encode experiences should resample memories in a particular order. Emerging
research is beginning to reveal these evidentiary dynamics (Mildner & Tamir, 2024).
Knowing how people think may say more about the function of thought than knowing what
people think about. This review identifies new tools in natural language processing (NLP), computational
modeling, and network science that researchers can use to track thought dynamics to reveal thought’s
function.
How do people think?
Thoughts are dynamic. A framework for modeling the flow of thoughts needs to explain how
thoughts move—when do thoughts jump from one topic to the next, and why do they move in the
particular directions they move? Several prominent models of spontaneous thought center dynamics. For
example, Mildner & Tamir (2019) propose a framework based on computational models of memory with
four layers, including parts that independently account for both dynamics and content. The bottom layers
represent the episodic memory content of thought, scaffolded by semantic memory. Thoughts traverse
semantic and episodic memories in a clustered fashion, drawing thoughts from one topic at a time before
jumping to a new topic cluster. In the top layers of the model, one’s current state and a drifting thought
context determine which parts of memory space thoughts explore and which topic to select next. These
dynamics rely on associative structures that organize possible thought content.
Christoff and colleagues (2016) offer a neurally grounded model of spontaneous thought that
centers dynamics as the defining feature. Spontaneous thought is defined by the degree to which it is
dynamic vs. constrained. Constraints on motion can arise from two forces: Deliberate forces constrain the
freedom of thought through cognitive control. Automatic forces constrain thought dynamics by drawing
the mind toward highly salient content, either affective or sensory. The amount of constraint imposed by
neural networks for cognitive control or salience, respectively, determines the dynamics of the mind.
Quantifying these dynamics will be essential to understanding the key players that determine spontaneous
thought.
Quantifying Spontaneous Thought Dynamics
Emerging methods enable researchers to quantify the thought dynamics proposed by these
theoretical frameworks. Think-aloud protocols, where participants verbalize their thoughts as they occur,
are invaluable for capturing the full content in a thought stream (Mildner & Tamir, 2021, 2024; Raffaelli
et al., 2021; Sripada & Taxali, 2020). Natural language processing makes it possible to quantify this
content. For example, researchers can automatically transcribe the stream, parse it into individual
thoughts, and quantify how one thought relates to the next as semantic distance, a proxy for the
magnitude of the conceptual leap between thoughts. New analytic tools make it possible to model these
data, and in doing so, uncover the factors that determine the motion of this stream over time. We can
develop empirically tractable models that allow us to predict the flow of thoughts; we can analyze the
structure of thought networks and paths through these networks to accurately describe the flow of
thoughts. Below, we introduce these two approaches for quantifying spontaneous thought dynamics using
computational modeling and network science, respectively, to reveal its function.
Modeling Spontaneous Thought
Here we describe one instantiation of a neural network model that can arbitrate between different
possible functions of thought. Prior work has modeled the motion of free thought as people sample
content from memory in service of making a decision (Zhao et al., 2022). This search process is similar
to, albeit more constrained, than the process of spontaneous thought. At each time point, the decision
model receives information about a decider's current thought. These thoughts are drawn from a
circumscribed bank of thoughts generated by all participants (e.g., a positive feature of an option),
clustered by their support in favor of the decision options (e.g., yes, no, or neutral). It then learns how to
predict the decider's next thought. The critical component of this model is a context representation or
memory buffer, inspired by models of memory retrieval (J. R. Anderson et al., 2004; Howard & Kahana,
2002; Polyn et al., 2009; Raaijmakers & Shiffrin, 1981). This context tracks which thought clusters have
been sampled, and their associated features. Until the model makes a decision, it continues to sample
thoughts. This model allows researchers to test which features maximally enable it to correctly pick the
next thought. By including or excluding specific features, or mechanisms, into the context layer, they can
quantify which formulation best fits human data. Models that incorporated decay in the memory context,
such that the most recent thought is more influential in the memory context than preceding thoughts,
performed very well. This finding suggests that we are more likely to sample thoughts similar to recent
thoughts than those dissimilar to recent thoughts.
One could model the flow of thought in a similar way. In the proposed setup, a model of
spontaneous thought would receive information about a thinker's current thought at each timepoint. These
thoughts can be drawn from a large but still circumscribed bank of possible thoughts. The model then
needs to learn how to predict the thinker's next thought. It makes these predictions based on features of
the current thought and a running tally of previous thoughts. Thus, there are two layers: the context layer
reflects features of the current and recent thoughts, which serve as input to the model, and the output layer
thoughts. The number of recent thoughts and their effects are weighted by a decay parameter. The context
layer keeps track of relevant features of the input thoughts. Some features relate to content, while others
relate to the dynamics of the input thoughts. A weighted combination of the features in the context layer
determines the output: the features of the next thought. This output then becomes the current thought and
the process starts again.
First, the prior thought(s) comprise the input to the model. For the purpose of this model, we
define each thought as a set of features based on psychologically relevant dimensions that capture the
content and abstract features of thoughts. While there are an infinite number of possible thoughts in
theory, in practice, people tend to think only a smaller subset of them (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2013;
Smallwood & Schooler, 2015). We can reduce the dimensionality of the possible thoughts layer by
extracting relevant thought features from real-world data. By analyzing a large dataset of spontaneous
thoughts we can quantify the most typical topics and features of their content. For instance, while your
thoughts may be unique in the sense that nobody else is thinking about cuddling up with your fluffy dog
on your comfy couch after work, many people likely have thoughts that are positive, about the near
future, in their home, related to their pets. We can use these features as input to a model trained to predict
subsequent thoughts from current ones.
The context layer summarizes features of the current thought and active preceding thoughts. In
this way, this layer keeps track of where in thought-space the mind is currently. The extent to which
preceding thoughts are represented in the context layer depends on a decay rate. If decay is low, context
will take into account the current thought and several preceding thoughts weighted according to the decay
rate; if decay is high, it will encode only the current thought. The context can encode features related to
both content and dynamics. Content features impact what content is prominent in all thoughts (e.g.,
relevance to ongoing goal pursuit, temporal orientation, level of abstraction or detail, and valence).
Dynamics features impact the distance and direction of a subsequent thought (e.g., a momentum
parameter determining the direction of the next thought). Both types of features can be used to predict
how a mind jumps from the current thought to the next.
The output layer uses these features to decide which thought to sample next. This decision is
based on learned weights between the features encoded in the context layer and features in the output
later. For example, if the mind chooses thoughts that are similar in valence, then an activated positive
valence node would have a high weight on other thoughts similar in valence to the current thought; if the
mind considers momentum, then a positive momentum node would add weights to thoughts that are more
positive than the current one. Figuring out how to weigh each feature is key to modeling thought flow.
This decision—and the features in the context layer that drive it—can help reveal the function of
spontaneous thought.
We can use this model to formalize and test hypotheses about how different functions shape
spontaneous thought. By adding or removing features in the context layer, we can test which set of
features is important for accurately predicting the flow of spontaneous thought. If a feature of current
thought content influences subsequent thoughts, we can infer that that type of content may be relevant to
the function of thought; if a thought dynamic does shape the direction of thoughts or the timing of a
thought jump, this tells us something about why thoughts move at all.
More complex versions of this model are also possible. For example, the input layer could
include nodes for all possible clusters of thoughts; a middle layer could represent the learned
psychologically relevant dimensions; the output layer could decide whether to stay in the current cluster
or switch clusters in addition to deciding on the next thought. However, for this review, we focus on the
richness of insight that can be extracted from the simpler implementation.
Each hypothesis about why people think entails predictions about which features of thought shape
its flow. We can capture these hypotheses by using different instantiations of the model that include
different subsets of features, each associated with a particular function. We can then compare the
accuracy of these models—which features enable the most optimal predictions? Answering this question
can thus elucidate the function of spontaneous thought.
Spontaneous Thought as a Network
Innovations in network theory offer a second approach for testing the function of thought.
Networks offer a means to quantify the relationships and interactions of interconnected systems. Thoughts
could operate like nodes in a spatially-embedded network. How nodes of thought are arranged relative to
each other gives us insight into the shape of the landscape of thought. Thoughts can be close to each
other—because they are semantically similar or strongly linked in memory—or far from each other.
Distance is reflected in the edge strength between the nodes. How people traverse these edges gives us
insight into how people move through that landscape. We can thus quantify an individual’s thought space
by constructing graphs of individuals’ thought streams. The dynamics of thought are reflected in each
impacts memory optimization. During a recall task, sparse and dense links in the low- and high-clustered
networks, respectively, can lead to repeated paths limiting discovery of new animals. B) Activation
patterns impact emotion regulation. A weak regulator may be able to only activate nodes close to the
current affective states while a strong regulator can activate more distant, positive nodes. C) The
centrality of goal relevant thoughts impacts goal pursuit. Central, highly connected goal-relevant thoughts
would support sustained attention on goals by making it more likely that the thought stream revisit goal-
related ideas.
Finally, if certain nodes can shift the activation dynamics of the network, we can test how
regulation abilities might be activating nodes that drive activation of other nodes that are very far from the
current affective state nodes. During moments of affective homeostasis, people might activate nodes that
drive activation of other nearby nodes, creating more focused or rigid flows of thought. As thoughts shift
from one function to the next (e.g., from emotion regulation to goal pursuit) either over time within
individuals or across individuals–we might also see these parameters shift between prioritizing thought
jumps along high edge weights and moving more liberally along lower edge weight paths.
We can quantify the features of the structure. For example, we can extract metrics such as the
clustering coefficient, which quantifies the extent to which nodes are interconnected. A high clustering
coefficient indicates a tightly connected network of thoughts. A lower clustering coefficient might
indicate a more diffuse and exploratory thought process. The path length quantifies the number of steps or
distance between thoughts. Shorter path lengths suggest that thoughts are closely related and easily
accessible, while longer path lengths might indicate a broader search. We can quantify these features for
an individual walk, or alternatively for repeated walks to probe the underlying structure of a person’s
thought space. Some structures will be more optimal for certain functions. To test how well a thought
network is optimized for each function, we can compare summary metrics from thought networks to those
extracted from networks optimized for specific functions of thought, like efficient memory search or goal
pursuit (Hills et al., 2012).
In addition to quantifying the properties of networks as a whole, graph theory also captures the
qualities of individual nodes. For example, each node can be attributed an eigenvector centrality or
betweenness centrality that reflects how connected a node is to other highly connected nodes and how
often a node lies in the shortest path between other nodes, respectively. Influential thoughts should have
high centrality. By quantifying the relation between centrality and function-relevant features of thoughts,
we can learn about the function of thought. That is, variation of within-network metrics can help elucidate
the functions of spontaneous thought.
Finally, certain nodes might change the activation pattern of the network, or the way in which
people walk through the network. The dynamical framework of network control theory suggests that
some nodes will drive activation of only nearby nodes, while others will drive activation of nodes that are
further away (Parkes et al., 2024). This possibility aligns with the dynamic framework of spontaneous
thought (Christoff et al., 2016). Identifying nodes that, when activated, can push the whole system into a
different dynamical regime (e.g., low variability or high variability) has implications for understanding
the function of spontaneous thought.
The Functions of Thought
Spontaneous thought may have multiple concurrent functions. Here we focus on three: memory
optimization, emotion regulation, and goal pursuit. For each function, we discuss how it is reflected in the
contents and dynamics of spontaneous thought. We then discuss how it can be tested in a neural network
model and using network theory.
Memory Optimization
One possible function of spontaneous thought is memory optimization, where useful episodes are
encoded more deeply, and useful abstractions are extracted across related episodes. There is a clear link
between spontaneous thought and memory. Spontaneous thought during waking rest often looks like
memory replay, specifically of episodic memories. Experience sampling studies estimate that up to 60%
of spontaneous thought is episodic in nature (Mills et al., 2018; Song & Wang, 2012). These episodic
thoughts occur as replay of recent memories, as episodic simulation of future events, and as unique
fantastical combinations of episodic details (Schacter et al., 2007).
Such offline processing, or memory replay, during waking rest has been shown to aid in memory
consolidation (Wamsley, 2022). During memory replay, memory traces in the hippocampus
spontaneously reactivate. Memory traces do not reactivate in their original order, however; replaying past
events as they occurred is not the most effective way to improve memory. Instead, they reactivate in
novel sequences. According to the Default Variability Hypothesis, the variability of spontaneous thought
is key for memory optimization (Mills et al., 2018). This variability can help optimize memory in two
ways. First, novel sequences help decorrelate related episodic memories. During episodic simulation,
people flexibly recombine episodic details from memory. By recalling episodic details in different orders
and contexts, overlapping episodic memories are decorrelated into separate representations to preserve
and strengthen important features of each memory. Second, novel sequencing facilitates extraction of new
semantic knowledge from across multiple experiences. Extracting semantic knowledge is a gradual
process that relies on revisiting experiences multiple times, preferably jumping between different
experiences to identify commonalities and differences, as in interleaved learning. Spontaneous thought,
with its ceaseless wandering from one topic to the next, may provide the perfect conditions for both of
these memory processes.
Emerging research suggests that spontaneous thought dynamics may be tailored to optimizing
memory (Mildner & Tamir, 2024). Researchers tracked the dynamics of episodic detail during
spontaneous thought to see if it followed patterns predicted by optimal foraging theory. Originally
developed as a model for how animals forage for food, optimal foraging theory suggests that to maximize
food intake over time, an animal should switch to a new food source when the current one becomes less
productive. This concept has been adapted to explain how people search through semantic space during
semantic fluency tasks. For example, during these tasks, people take longer to find words within a single
cluster until they decide to switch to a new cluster, at which point search times drop again. Predicting
when a person will switch clusters can be accomplished by setting a threshold on the search time variable.
These dynamics also appear in spontaneous thought, where thoughts tend to cluster around a
single topic until a thought jump moves the mind to a new topic (Mildner & Tamir, 2024). Thoughts
should jump away from a cluster when it no longer serves its purpose, and land on a new one that does.
Because memory optimization relies on recalling episodic details, the dynamics of thought should
prioritize episodic detail, jumping to a new topic when detail dips too low. Indeed, this study found that
the first thought after a topic jump typically contained the most episodic detail, with detail gradually
decreasing until the next jump. By using natural language processing and hierarchical clustering to
identify thought jumps, this work offers a first peek into how the dynamics of thought may optimize
memory by maximizing episodic detail.
Modeling the Memory Optimization Function. Together, these findings on the content and
dynamics of spontaneous thought suggest that it may serve to optimize memory. We can further test this
hypothesis using a neural network model of spontaneous thought by testing the importance of the
following features: the amount of episodic richness or the temporal orientation of a thought.
First, if the mind spontaneously recalls the past or recombines memory traces into possible future
events, episodic content should be a key feature of our model. As in the work above, we can test if, in an
optimal model of spontaneous thought, the context layer keeps a running average of the amount of
episodic detail in the stream of thought and executes a large jump, akin to a topic switch, when the current
thought contains less episodic detail than the running average of prior thoughts. This mechanism would
maximize the amount of episodic detail in thought while at the same time ensuring a certain amount of
variability by triggering larger jumps regularly.
Second, if memory optimization is a function of spontaneous thought, the mind may choose to
prioritize the recall of similar experiences. For instance, thinking about a conversation with a friend in the
near past may lead to a related thought from another conversation in the recent past. We would see
evidence for this as high weights on the content variables reflecting memory-relevant features, and a slow
decay rate over context.
Thus, we can test the role of spontaneous thought in memory optimization by tracking the
dynamics of features such as the temporal orientation or amount of episodic detail of a thought, and fine-
tuning its switching mechanism to be attuned to these features. If our model parallels human data, then
memory optimization may serve as a function of spontaneous thought. In that case, spontaneous thought
patterns that match the memory-optimization mechanisms specified in our model should lead to enhanced
memory for recalled experiences.
Memory Optimization in a Network of Thought. Some thought landscapes, and the routes
overlaid on them are more conducive to memory optimization than others. Network science can offer
insight into whether typical spontaneous thought dynamics prioritize features important to memory
optimization as well as the effect of spontaneous thought on memory consolidation.
spontaneous thought network has a highly organized or clustered structure, then thoughts would primarily
walk over strong edges between similar concepts in a semantic network or experiences in a memory
network. This dynamic might promote efficient recall within those clusters. However, tight clustering
could limit the flexibility needed to abstract away from specific instances or to recall information in new
contexts. In contrast, if an individual’s network has random, loosely connected thoughts characterized by
low clustering and low edge-weights, then thoughts would primarily walk over weaker edges in the
semantic or memory network. This might lead to inefficient memory retrieval. The ideal spontaneous
thought network may strike a balance between these two extremes of randomness and clustering.
Moderate clustering, where related memories form loosely connected clusters, would support recall by
maintaining strong, associative links within clusters while allowing enough flexibility to retrieve
information across contexts. Indeed, semantic network are built in this way, balancing local clustering and
randomness, with high utility for memory (Benedek et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2016;
Marupaka et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2013; Steyvers & Tenenbaum, 2005).
Second, the centrality of certain nodes might indicate the importance of memory optimization
function in spontaneous thought. If thought dynamics prioritize revisiting key anchor points in memory,
we would expect thoughts to frequently traverse edges connecting concepts rich in episodic detail. This
would result in those detail-rich thoughts becoming more central within the network, suggesting their
importance in guiding memory retrieval and providing cues that facilitate associative thinking, helping
people link related memories more efficiently.
Third, if certain nodes can shift the activation dynamics of the network, we can test which content
drives such shifts. For example, thoughts low in episodic detail might serve as triggers for shifting to a
higher variability state to increase the likelihood of finding richer detail; thoughts high in episodic detail
might cool that variability, allowing thoughts to more thoroughly explore clusters of episodic detail.
Finally, the relation between thought network structure and the trajectory of thought is dynamic:
the structure of a network shapes thought trajectory, and thought trajectories shape the network structure.
Edges can be loosened (decrease in edge weight) or strengthened (increase in edge weight) depending on
how they have been walked in spontaneous thought. Analyzing how the structure of these networks
evolve over time can therefore offer insights into how spontaneous thought aids consolidating, retaining,
and abstracting away from specific episodic experiences.
Emotion Regulation
Our minds may wander to help us regulate our emotions. Emotions are a fundamental part of the
human experience. They weave through every moment in life, influencing how we perceive the world,
how we act, and how we interact. It’s crucial to regulate emotions effectively. Disturbances in this ability
at both clinical (e.g., mood disorders) and subclinical (e.g., difficulties with emotion regulation) levels can
have devastating consequences for wellbeing. For example, not being able to regulate one’s emotions can
lead to heightened negative affect and mood disorders, can strain interpersonal relationships, and disrupt
sleep (Eagleson et al., 2016; Gross & John, 2003; Hoag et al., 2016; Ray et al., 2010, p. 201). Given the
import of emotion regulation, if spontaneous thoughts helped to maintain affective homeostasis, this
would be a powerful tool for maintaining overall wellbeing. If emotion regulation is a key function of
spontaneous thought, a couple of prerequisites should be met.
First, thoughts should offer a window into the unfolding effects of emotions. The content of
spontaneous thought is inextricably linked to emotion experience. Emotional content is ubiquitous in
thought: it is present in roughly 50-67% of waking self-generated thoughts and 75-90% of dream reports
(Fox, 2016; Fox et al., 2013; Killingsworth & Gilbert, 2010). At baseline, self-generated thoughts tend to
be rated as mildly pleasant, positive, and enjoyable, although the valence of thoughts varies widely from
person to person and at any given time (Fox et al., 2018). When a person is feeling positive, their thoughts
tend to be positive, future-oriented, less personally significant and more specific (Andrews-Hanna et al.,
2013). When a person is feeling negative, their thoughts are typically more negative, past-oriented, self-
focused, and less specific (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2013; Raffaelli et al., 2021).
Emotions also change thought dynamics. Positive emotions broaden our awareness and encourage
novel, varied and exploratory thoughts and actions (Huppert et al., 2004). Negative emotions cause
repetitive thoughts with less dynamic conceptual associations (Kim et al., 2022; Smith & Alloy, 2009). A
variety of mental health conditions alter thought dynamics, in particular. Mania can trigger racing,
fleeting thoughts; while ruminative thinking is transdiagnostic of depression, anxiety, and OCD
(Marchetti et al., 2016). The dynamics of spontaneous thought thus reflect different affective experiences.
Second, the content and dynamics of spontaneous thought should impact our affective
experiences. That is, if thoughts function to facilitate emotion regulation, then they should do more than
just reflect affective experiences, they should also cause emotions to change. We see several ways in
which thought content can influence emotions. First, studies using lag analyses show that the emotional
content of thoughts predicts subsequent mood (Ruby, Smallwood, Engen, et al., 2013). Past or other-
related thoughts are associated with subsequent negative mood, even if the content of the thought was
positive, while the opposite holds true for future and self-directed thoughts (Ruby, Smallwood, Sackur, et
al., 2013). Second, emotion regulation strategies directly intervene on what individuals are thinking in
order to improve mood. For example, cognitive reappraisal and positive thinking reframe thought content
to increase positive and decrease negative affect (Eagleson et al., 2016; Ray et al., 2010). Linguistic
distancing (i.e,. reducing the use of first person pronouns and present-tense verbs) decreases the severity
of internalizing symptoms and leads to better outcomes in therapy sessions (Nook et al., 2022).
Distraction and suppression propose avoiding certain thought content in order to temporarily diminish the
intensity of an emotional experience.
Thought dynamics too can influence emotions. The way in which thoughts flow from one to the
next at slower or faster paces, covering smaller or larger distances, moving in a single direction or a
circular one, can facilitate movement through conceptual space and change how a person construes
situations, in turn, regulating emotion. For example, expansive thinking triggers positive emotions.
Manipulating thoughts to occur faster or with greater variety improves mood and decreases depression
(Pronin, 2013; Pronin & Jacobs, 2008). The more free moving thought is, the more positive valence in the
moment and in the future. On the flip side, as thoughts become more negative, they tend to become more
semantically similar to the next thought (Raffaelli et al., 2021). This leads to a narrowing of conceptual
scope following negative thoughts, which may, in turn, increase negative emotions.
Taken together, these insights highlight emotion regulation as a potential primary function of
thought. Affective experience shape what we think about and how we think, and our spontaneous
thoughts may likewise govern our emotional experiences.
Modeling the Emotion Regulation Function. These findings of a bidirectional relationship
between emotions and the dynamics of spontaneous thought suggests that thoughts may help individuals
maintain affective homeostasis. We can test this hypothesis with a neural network model of spontaneous
thought by testing the importance of emotion-relevant content (e.g., emotionality, valence) and
momentum in the context layer. In particular, we expect to see certain dynamics when the valence of the
current state is highly negative, such that thoughts maximize the likelihood of moving away from
negative towards positive states.
First, we can test if an optimal model of spontaneous thought accounts for thought momentum.
Momentum can be captured by tracking the valence of the current thought, a running average (via a decay
function) of past thoughts, and choosing subsequent thoughts that maintain movement in a particular
direction. These features would allow for momentum-like dynamics, such that adjacent thoughts maintain
a similar valence, while also moving thoughts in the direction of more regulated emotions. Further, we
could characterize the content level variables that determine the force of propulsion behind this
momentum.
Second, to regulate emotions, people may need to make quick, large jumps away from distressing
content. If spontaneous emotion regulation capitalizes on this kind of dynamic, an optimal model of
thought should have an emotion or valence threshold that triggers a large jump. This dynamic would be
reflected in the output layer of our model, where after a distressing thought, the next selected thought
should be semantically distant rather than similar in extreme negative valence.
In all, we can test the role of spontaneous thought in emotion regulation by tracking the dynamics
of features such as the valence or emotional intensity of thoughts, and fine-tuning its thresholds to be
attuned to these features. If our model accurately mirrors human data, then emotion regulation may serve
as a function of spontaneous thought. In that case, spontaneous thought patterns that align with the
emotion-regulation mechanisms specified in our model should lead to improved emotional stability and
quicker recovery from negative emotional states. This would suggest that spontaneous thought plays a
critical role in maintaining affective homeostasis, providing a self-regulating system for emotional well-
being.
Emotion Regulation in a Network of Thought. Emotion regulation should affect the trajectory
of spontaneous thought. Successful emotion regulators should move away from negative conceptual
spaces towards positive ones, while unsuccessful regulators might ruminate on negative ideas. These two
types of individuals should exhibit thought dynamics–quantified by walks on existing semantic
networks—that differ in meaningful ways.
First, differences in the clustering coefficients, characteristic path length, or average edge weight
of semantic networks likely shape the way thoughts move, influencing emotion regulation. A network
with a low clustering coefficient might be especially well suited for emotion regulation as its structure
allows thoughts to travel along weaker semantic connections, helping individuals escape a negative
headspace. By reducing the tight association between similar concepts, this network structure supports
more expansive thinking, allowing thoughts to cover a broader range of ideas. Successful emotion
regulators may benefit from traversing fewer tightly connected clusters of negative thoughts, where
longer distances between clusters enable movement away from negative conceptual spaces. In contrast, a
network with high clustering and strong connections may constrain thought trajectories, possibly leading
to ruminative patterns. In such cases, ineffective regulators might find themselves trapped in densely
connected clusters of negative thoughts, with higher edge weights and shorter path lengths, limiting their
ability to break free from negative thought patterns.
Second, the centrality of positive, negative, and neutral thoughts within the network likely plays a
key role in emotion regulation. If negative thoughts hold higher centrality, they may act as attractor states,
pulling individuals back to negative ideas more frequently. This could make it harder for someone to shift
away from negative conceptual spaces, reinforcing ruminative patterns. In contrast, for successful
emotion regulators, we would expect to see negative thoughts with lower centrality, indicating they are
less influential and less likely to dominate the thought network. Instead, thoughts with positive or neutral
content may be more central, guiding individuals toward more adaptive, emotionally balanced thought
trajectories. This distinction highlights how the structure and dynamics of an individual's thought
processes can shape their ability to regulate emotions.
Finally, if certain nodes can shift the activation dynamics of the network, we can test how
regulation abilities might be activating nodes that drive activation of other nodes that are very far from the
current affective state nodes. During moments of affective homeostasis, people might activate nodes that
drive activation of other nearby nodes, creating more focused or rigid flows of thought. As thoughts shift
from one function to the next (e.g., from emotion regulation to goal pursuit) either over time within
individuals or across individuals–we might also see these parameters shift between prioritizing thought
jumps along high edge weights and moving more liberally along lower edge weight paths.
Goal Pursuit
People pursue a variety of goals, both large and small, in their daily life. While deliberate thought
can provide a straightforward path to addressing these goals, spontaneous thought also plays an important
role in goal pursuit. Early research on daydreaming and mind wandering highlighted the prevalence of
current concerns in spontaneous thought (Klinger, 2013; Klinger & Cox, 1987), and more recent studies
indicate that nearly half of all spontaneous thoughts are relevant to one’s goals (Stawarczyk, 2018). For
instance, you might find yourself imagining the taste of a home-cooked meal on the bus, or brainstorm
new solutions to a work problem while waiting in line at the grocery store. A key function of spontaneous
thought may be to help individuals attend to and actively pursue their goals.
Spontaneous thoughts helps with goal pursuit in several ways. First, they can help one keep track
of multiple concurrent goals. Environmental cues associated with a goal amplify spontaneous thoughts
about it (Jordão & St. Jacques, 2022), meaning that thoughts about goals can arise at any time, as the
environment introduces stimuli related to current concerns. This may help ensure one is ready to act on
current concerns, even while deliberately focusing on a different goal (Klinger et al., 2018).
Second, spontaneous thought can facilitate planning for the future (Klinger et al., 2018). While
deliberative planning–such as making a grocery list–is not classified as spontaneous thought, spontaneous
thought can contain fragments of goal-oriented ideas that aid in future decision-making (Cole &
Kvavilashvili, 2021). For instance, when your home-cooked meal comes to mind on the bus, you might
also imagine friends and family enjoying it, which can help you later decide what to cook for a dinner
party. Indeed, spontaneous thought is often about the future rather than the past or present (F. T.
Anderson & McDaniel, 2019; Baumeister et al., 2020; D’Argembeau et al., 2011; Warden et al., 2019), in
particular, about events coming up within the next few days (Berntsen & Jacobsen, 2008; Kvavilashvili &
Rummel, 2020). Goal relevant thought often takes the form of imagining goal-relevant scenarios, and
planning in particular (Kvavilashvili & Rummel, 2020; Mazzoni, 2019; Plimpton et al., 2015). This
prospective bias offers evidence that spontaneous thought helps us prepare to achieve our goals.
Goals clearly shape the content of spontaneous thought. There is also emerging evidence that
goals shape the dynamics of thought, albeit in a distinct way from how memory shapes dynamics. In
particular, goal-related content seems to ramp up before a topic jump and then decline after the jump
(Mildner & Tamir, 2024). The more one is concerned about a topic, the more pronounced this dynamic.
This dynamic suggests that goals may serve as attractors in thought space. As the mind wanders closer to
a current concern, or as cues in the environment prime thoughts about a current concern, movement
towards this concern ramps up. If spontaneous thought serves as a reminder of current concerns that have
been temporarily placed on the backburner, the dynamics of thought should be geared to jump between
different current concerns and not linger on a single one for too long. Thus, once reactivated, thoughts
about a current concern can ramp down again. Features of current concerns themselves may affect which
current concerns serve as the strongest attractors. For instance, it may preferentially select goals that are
important, require imminent action, or are congruent with a current or desired emotional state.
Modeling the Goal Pursuit Function. A wealth of evidence suggests that spontaneous thought
may help people to pursue their goals. We can test for this function of spontaneous thought by evaluating
the importance of goal-related features and temporal orientation to an optimal model of spontaneous
thought. Goal-related features include the relevance of each thought to a goal and goal importance. We
can measure goal relevance using large-scale data to catalog common goals and then natural language
processing to assess the similarity between these goals and each thought. We can measure goal
importance as the overall frequency with which goals occur in spontaneous thoughts.
First, if goals are relevant to the content of spontaneous thought, then the mind should prioritize
activating thoughts about similar goals in adjacent thoughts. For example, if the current thought is most
highly related to the goal of eating healthily, then subsequent thoughts are also likely to be related to that
goal. This can be captured as binary (i.e., the same or different goal) or continuous (e.g., the amount of
relevance to each goal) similarity, which the model accounts for in a decay function over goal-relevance
and a weight on goal-related similarity, within a cluster.
Second, goal pursuits may affect which topics the mind gravitates to. If spontaneous thought
serves a planning function, the model should preferentially jump to thoughts that address the most
important goals, particularly those salient in the near future. If spontaneous thought helps the mind
maintain awareness of multiple concerns, an optimal model should keep a running tally of recent goal-
related thoughts, and prioritize moving to an undersampled goal. This mechanism would help a mind stay
attuned to current concerns on the backburner, by making sure to cycle through current concerns rather
than focusing on a small subset.
Spontaneous thoughts need to balance sampling both important goals and currently undersampled
goals, and individuals may place different weights on these factors. Modeling these individualized
weights may help explain why some people’s minds get stuck in deep ruminative trenches, why others’
flit shallowly through to-do lists, and how others’ more optimally balance problem solving and goal
maintenance.
In sum, we can test whether the function of thought is to aid in goal pursuits by tracking the
dynamics of goal-relevant features, and fine-tuning weights in the output layer. If a model with these
mechanisms fits human data, then aiding in goal pursuit is likely to be a function of spontaneous thought.
In that case, spontaneous thought patterns that adhere very closely to this model should produce better
outcomes in terms of goal pursuit, such as more spontaneous planning and increased preparedness to act
on multiple different goals at any given time.
Goal Pursuit in a Network of Thought. We can test the hypothesis that one function of
spontaneous thought is to aid in goal pursuit by examining how the structure of thought networks reflects
behaviors associated with attending to and achieving goals. If spontaneous thought is optimized for goal
pursuit, we would expect certain network properties to reveal this focus.
First, we might expect that goal-relevant thoughts occupy nodes with higher centrality within the
thoughts, creating multiple pathways back to those nodes. This would allow spontaneous thoughts to
frequently return to goal-relevant ideas, increasing their influence within the thought stream. For example,
if a student is preparing for an important exam, thoughts about study materials, exam strategies, and
relevant subjects might hold higher centrality, making them more prominent in the student's thinking. The
centrality of these goal-related thoughts could reflect a hierarchy in goal-importance, with the most
important goals represented by the nodes with the highest centrality. These central nodes act as attractor
states, pulling thoughts back toward them and ensuring sustained attention on goal-directed actions. Thus,
the structure of the thought network, particularly the distribution of centrality, reveals how spontaneous
thoughts support or hinder the pursuit of goals.
Second, the structure of thought networks likely influences goal pursuit. If a thought network is
highly clustered, with strong connections (high edge weights) between goal-relevant nodes, this structure
should facilitate more focused and efficient goal-directed thinking. In such a network, thoughts are more
likely to follow paths that repeatedly link back to goal-related ideas, ensuring that attention stays centered
on achieving current concerns. The high clustering and shorter path lengths in these networks would
reflect a streamlined, goal-focused trajectory, where thoughts flow quickly between related concepts. On
the other hand, when the thought network has lower clustering, weaker edge weights, and longer path
lengths, it might signal a lack of goal-directed focus. In this case, thoughts may wander more freely,
covering less goal-relevant ground. This looser, more exploratory network structure could indicate that
the mind is not actively engaged in goal pursuit, allowing for more random and unstructured thinking.
Thus, the structure of the thought network—whether tightly or loosely organized—directly impacts the
mind's ability to pursue goals effectively.
By analyzing the structure of thought networks and the attributes of individual thoughts within
those networks, we can gain deeper insight into how our minds navigate the complex task of attending to
and pursuing goals.
Quantifying Individual Differences in Spontaneous Thought
The proposed approaches to studying spontaneous thought can also help capture individual
differences in patterns of thought. Quantifying thought motion, either using computational modeling or
network approaches, can help characterize and quantify these different thought patterns. Each individual
may have a different decay parameter that determines how much the context layer changes with each
subsequent thought; individuals may have different clustering coefficients, or different numbers of highly
central nodes. We can measure these kinds of parameters to model the contents and dynamics of
spontaneous thought for each individual and then test how these variations in spontaneous thought are
beneficial or maladaptive for individuals.
Creativity
Creativity consists of a combination of two processes: one to generate new ideas and one to
evaluate the quality and appropriateness of the new ideas (Finke et al., 1992). Creative generation is a
relatively unconstrained and associative form of thought that is similar to spontaneous thought (Girn et
al., 2020). The dynamics of thought are tightly linked to creativity, particularly the associative processes
that guide memory search (Beaty et al., 2023; Beaty & Kenett, 2023; Benedek et al., 2023; Mednick,
1962). For example, the speed and clustering of items during memory recall and the connectivity,
distance, and structure of individuals’ semantic networks have been linked to greater generativity (Kenett
& Faust, 2019; Tellez et al., 2024).
Future work that quantifies the dynamics of spontaneous thought directly will shed further light
on optimally creative processes. For example, highly creative individuals might find an optimal clustering
or context decay parameter that balances greater randomness (high decay, low clustering) with constraint
(low decay, high clustering). Creativity might be associated with more nodes that drive activation of other
far vs. near nodes. Finally, the iterative process of creativity might be defined by predictable variability in
these variables, as individuals oscillate between idea generation and evaluation, and by progressive
increases in the specificity and constraint applied during the generative process (Campbell, 1960; Pinho et
al., 2015).
Mental health
Spontaneous thought is tightly linked to mental health. Multiple mental health conditions are
characterized by divergent thought patterns. For instance, manic episodes are accompanied by racing
thoughts (Piguet et al., 2010), where the mind rapidly shifts from one idea to another. Depressive states
can be marked by ruminative thinking (Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008; Watkins, 2008), where the mind
repeatedly scrolls through the same negative thoughts. The link between spontaneous thought arises
because thoughts both reflect and drive changes in psychological well-being. For example, ruminative
dynamics can, in turn, can exacerbate feelings of hopelessness and sadness.
Quantifying spontaneous thought offers a deeper understanding of how these maladaptive
patterns arise and sustain themselves (Hudachek & Wamsley, 2024; Rostami et al., 2022). For instance,
we can test how adjustments to key parameters in a model of spontaneous thought simulate specific
thought patterns. Does having more nodes that switch the network into a high variability state mimic the
rapid shifts in content seen during mania or in ADHD? Does decreasing the amount of decay simulate the
persistent focus on a single theme seen in obsessive-compulsive disorder? Does altering the weights on
emotion-related variables produce thought patterns that resemble rumination or worry? By quantifying
clustering coefficients or path lengths, can we capture the severity of an individual’s ADHD (Kérébel et
al., 2024)? Additionally, maladaptive thought patterns may fail to contribute to the proposed functions of
spontaneous thought and thereby exacerbate other symptoms such as memory deficits or poor emotion
regulation. Some changes to key parameters in the model may also be self-reinforcing, for instance, if
there is momentum towards negatively valenced thoughts and the current thought is negative, it may
become almost impossible to spontaneously transition to a more positive thought space and all subsequent
thoughts will be more likely to be negatively valenced as well. We propose that fitting individual-level
parameters in these models and networks can identify meaningful, transdiagnostic differences in thought
dynamics, leading to more accurate identification of clinical conditions and more targeted interventions.
Conclusion
The mind moves, unbidden, through a vast landscape of thought. Here, we propose two methods
for tracking the motion of this movement, and revealing the topography of the landscape through which it
moves. In both cases, we aim to reveal the factors that determine where the mind goes, when the mind
moves from one place to the next, and how the mind enacts its leaps, large or small. The ultimate goal is
to understand why the mind moves.
Why do we think anything at all? We suspect that a roving mind serves a purpose, giving people
an advantage over a fully blank mind attending to the task at hand or the environment. In particular, the
mind’s motion may help people consolidate memories, regulate emotions, and pursue goals. The
parameters that define an individual’s thought stream may reflect the underlying knowledge space
available for a mind to sample, or the dynamics of how it samples this space. Tracking the stability of
dynamics over time will shed light on the relationships between mind, thoughts, and real-world
functioning (Shareef-Trudeau et al., 2024). The efficiency with which people move through this
landscape of thought may have implications for wellbeing, cognitive and affective functioning, and
beyond.
