RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 3
Abstract
This study explored narcissistic states using a hierarchical, trifurcated structure, examining
state variability and trait-state associations of agentic extraversion, self-centered antagonism,
and narcissistic neuroticism. The primary objective was to investigate whether the structural
composition of narcissism, well-established in trait data, could be replicated in state data. We
examined this structure at both between- and within-person levels in state data, including
situation-specific compositions of narcissism. The study used data from an experimental
study where participants (N = 189) met in groups of up to four people weekly over six weeks.
Multilevel confirmatory factor analyses revealed that the narcissism structure was largely the
same at both levels. However, within-person compositions of narcissism differed across
affiliative versus controversial situations. In affiliative contexts, grandiosity manifested
exclusively through agentic extraversion, with no expression through self-centered
antagonism. In controversial settings, agentic extraversion and narcissistic neuroticism
exhibited a slight negative association, contrasting the positive association observed across
all group meetings. Our results show that narcissistic states exhibited less variability
compared to the Big Five and rarely varied above their corresponding trait levels. This
research contributes to a refined understanding of narcissism, highlighting the interplay
between trait tendencies and situational factors in shaping narcissistic state expressions.

Relations among the Trifurcated Narcissistic Domains at Trait and State Level: Two of
a Kind?
Over the last decade, narcissism—broadly defined as a personality trait marked by an inflated
positive self-view, a sense of entitlement, and frequent efforts to validate and enhance self-
esteem (e.g., Campbell & Foster, 2007; Morf et al., 2017)—has received considerable
research attention. Findings suggest a complex nomological network, including many real-
life consequences of narcissism (e.g., Back, 2018; Crowe et al., 2019; Krizan & Herlache,
2018; Miller et al., 2016, 2017). Recent research on trait narcissism extends the traditional
unidimensional view, emphasizing the construct’s hierarchical, multidimensional nature
(Ackerman et al., 2019; Back et al., 2013; Cain et al., 2008; Crowe et al., 2019; Krizan &
Herlache, 2018; Miller et al., 2016; Morf & Rhodewalt, 2001; Wright & Edershile, 2018).
The hierarchical conceptualization splits narcissism into two higher-order domains:
grandiosity and vulnerability. These domains further subdivide into a trifurcated structure at
the lower order. One domain reflects the shared antagonistic aspects of grandiosity and
vulnerability, while the other two domains distinctly capture their related yet separate agentic
and neurotic aspects.
Considerable progress has been made in understanding trait narcissism. However,
despite recent efforts in personality research proposing investigating and integrating between-
and within-person approaches to personality (e.g., Baumert et al., 2017), much less is known
about narcissism at the state level (e.g., Edershile & Wright, 2022; Miller et al., 2022). Some
studies on narcissism have started to bridge this gap. These studies focused on the relation
between narcissistic traits and narcissism-relevant states, such as self-esteem (Bosson et al.,
2008; Du et al., 2024; Geukes et al., 2017; Heyde, Vergauwe, et al., 2023; Kroencke et al.,
2023; Mota et al., 2022; Scharbert et al., 2024), and others examined narcissistic states as
momentary grandiosity and vulnerability (Edershile et al., 2019; Edershile & Wright, 2021a,
2021b; Giacomin & Jordan, 2016b, 2016a; Heyde et al., 2023).
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 5
The later studies explored the established narcissism trait domains at the state level.
However, Molenaar (2004) showed that within-person dynamics do not always mirror
between-person associations. A recent study by Rogoza, Krammer, et al. (2024) explored the
structural composition of narcissistic states, focusing separately on the two higher-order and
three lower-order domains. Their findings suggest that narcissistic states—at either
hierarchical level—mirror the organization observed at the trait level.
The present study seeks to extend the work of Rogoza, Krammer, et al. (2024) by
examining whether the hierarchical model of narcissism—comprising two higher-order and
three lower-order domains—equally applies to state-level expressions. Our primary objective
is to explore whether momentary expressions of narcissism at the state level align with the
established trait structure. We aim to examine the structural composition of narcissism at the
state level across multiple situational contexts, providing a comprehensive view of how
narcissistic states manifest across situations. Moreover, due to the experimental design of our
study, we can investigate situation-specific narcissism state structures, allowing us to identify
potential variations in the hierarchical model based on particular circumstances. This
approach enables us to not only validate the existing trait-based model in state-level
expressions but also to uncover potential specifics in narcissistic states that may be situation-
dependent.
Narcissism Conceptualization
Though traditionally distinct, theoretical conceptualizations of narcissism from
personality science, clinical psychology, and psychiatry have been meaningfully integrated in
recent years (see Cain et al., 2008). These efforts suggest that narcissism can be differentiated
into at least two domains—grandiosity and vulnerability—with partially overlapping
nomological networks (Cain et al., 2008; Miller et al., 2011; Pincus et al., 2009; Pincus &
Lukowitsky, 2010). Grandiosity is characterized by high self-esteem, overconfidence,
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 6
sociability, assertiveness, and exhibitionism. In contrast, vulnerability typically involves
lower and contingent self-esteem, shame-proneness, social withdrawal, and emotional
instability (Back et al., 2013; Crowe et al., 2019; Krizan & Herlache, 2018; Miller et al.,
2011; Miller & Campbell, 2008). At the trait level, grandiosity and vulnerability are
positively associated (e.g., r = .42; Crowe et al., 2019), reflecting commonalities between the
two domains. In particular, vulnerability and grandiosity share interpersonally antagonistic
attributes, such as egotism and entitlement (Back et al., 2013; Krizan & Herlache, 2018;
Miller et al., 2011; Miller & Campbell, 2008).
Further elaborating the idea of conceptually overlapping yet distinct narcissistic
domains, recent literature suggests a hierarchical narcissism structure with three lower-order
domains (e.g., Crowe et al., 2019; Krizan & Herlache, 2018; Miller et al., 2016). This
framework elucidates the shared characteristics and distinctions between grandiosity and
vulnerability. Employing a bass-ackward approach1, Crowe et al. (2019) identified a three-
domain structure, branching off grandiosity and vulnerability, referred to as Trifurcated
Model of Narcissism (TMN). The TMN identifies a central antagonism domain and two
peripheral domains that distinguish narcissism into agentic extraversion and narcissistic
neuroticism. Similarly, the Narcissistic Spectrum Model (Krizan & Herlache, 2018) divides
narcissism into three domains: entitled self-importance at the center, along with reactivity and
boldness at the peripheries. The primary distinction between the TMN and the Narcissistic
Spectrum Model lies in their core aspect. In essence, the entitlement domain in the
Narcissistic Spectrum Model can be understood as a narrower component of the antagonism
1 The bass-backwards approach proposed by Goldberg (2006) uses factor analysis to examine the hierarchical
structure of a set of variables. This method facilitates the examination of single to multiple factors and provides
valuable insights into the relations between variables at different levels of analysis. Through this approach,
researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying structure and linkages within data.
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 7
domain in the TMN (Crowe et al., 2019). Despite this minor distinction and differing
terminologies, the models largely overlap conceptually (cf. Crowe et al., 2022). An additional
model that can be incorporated into these conceptualizations but focuses on grandiosity
differentiates between narcissistic rivalry and admiration (Back, 2018; Back et al., 2013).
Rivalry can be seen as a form of narcissistic self-defense closely associated with self-centered
antagonism. In contrast, admiration represents narcissistic self-promotion, essentially
equating to agentic extraversion. The current study utilizes the terminology of the TMN, one
representative of the hierarchical three-dimensional conceptualization of narcissism.
Within the TMN, self-centered antagonism is characterized by entitlement, arrogance,
exploitativeness, and a lack of empathy. In contrast, agentic extraversion is associated with
assertiveness, leadership, self-esteem, and a behavioral preference for activation and
approach. Lastly, narcissistic neuroticism is linked to lower and dependent self-esteem,
negative emotionality or emotional dysregulation, a desire for admiration, and other self-
conscious emotions, such as shame (e.g., Crowe et al., 2019; Krizan & Herlache, 2018;
Miller, 2016). Positioned hierarchically beneath the two-domain model, the TMN domains
reflect either one or both higher-order domains. According to Crowe et al. (2019), agentic
extraversion is loaded by grandiosity (α = .96), while narcissistic neuroticism is loaded by
vulnerability (α = .93). Self-centred antagonism, however, is influenced by both domains
(grandiosity α = .68; vulnerability α = .69) and thus, serves as a crucial link between the two.
This structural relation is also evident in the correlations among the TMN domains.
Crowe et al. (2019) reported more substantial associations between self-centered antagonism
and narcissistic neuroticism (r = .39) and agentic extraversion (r = .50) than the latter two
domains have with each other (r = .28). Again, these results highlight the central role of self-
centered antagonism and suggest that the other two domains occupy more peripheral
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 8
positions within the structure of narcissism. This trait structure seems well established.
However, it remains unclear whether the same relations can be observed at the state level.
A Dynamic Approach to Personality: Integrating States and Traits
Researchers are increasingly advocating a dynamic approach to personality (e.g.,
Sosnowska et al., 2021), conceptualizing personality as stable dispositional traits with states
that can vary from moment to moment (Baumert et al., 2017; Jayawickreme et al., 2021).
Personality traits can be defined as “an individual's characteristic pattern of thought, emotion,
and behavior, together with the psychological mechanisms hidden or not—behind those
patterns” (Funder, 1997, p. 2). Personality states have the same content domain as their
corresponding traits. However, they refer to how a person is in a given moment rather than
how that person is in general (e.g., Fleeson, 2001).
This view is substantiated by the Whole Trait Theory (Fleeson, 2012; Fleeson &
Jayawickreme, 2015), which provides a comprehensive framework for understanding
personality traits incorporating a descriptive and explanatory side. The descriptive side views
traits as density distributions of states, reflecting the variability of individual states over time.
Meanwhile, the explanatory side focuses on the psychological mechanisms that give rise to
these dispositional traits. The theory integrates both trait and state approaches, proposing that
personality is not a set of fixed characteristics but rather a dynamic system where individual
states vary around a central tendency, referred to as the trait level. This conceptualization of
traits will guide the present study. Consequently, we will investigate the structural
composition of narcissism at both the within-person and between-person levels, utilizing
narcissistic state reports.
Narcissism at the State Level: Variability and Trait Relations
Empirical studies examining personality at the state level have demonstrated their
variability from moment to moment. This phenomenon has been observed in personality
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 9
domains like the Big Five and associated constructs, such as self-esteem and interests
(Donnellan et al., 2012; Fleeson, 2001; Roemer et al., 2021; Sherman et al., 2015; Horstmann
et al., 2021). Moreover, in line with the suggestions by Whole Trait Theory, the Big Five
personality states have been proposed to form a distribution around their corresponding trait,
demonstrating state manifestations below and above the trait level (e.g., Fleeson &
Jayawickreme, 2015).
Intraindividual Variability in Narcissistic States
Few studies examined narcissistic state variability. Some have investigated narcissism
variability by associating trait grandiosity with variability in self-esteem states (Geukes et al.,
2017). Other studies explicitly examined grandiosity and vulnerability states, associating
them with other state variables, such as stress or well-being (Giacomin & Jordan, 2016a,
2016b). For instance, Giacomin and Jordan (2016b) explored daily variability in grandiosity
and vulnerability, demonstrating substantial intraindividual variability, which was
systematically linked to subjective well-being. Another example comes from the study by
Mota et al. (2022) examining intraindividual variability in rivalry and admiration, associating
it with perceived status success. These studies mainly focused on external correlates of
variability in narcissistic states.
Examining the variability of narcissistic states more directly, studies showed that
intraclass correlations (ICCs) ranged between .47 and .64 for vulnerability and between .51
and .74 for grandiosity (Edershile et al., 2019; Edershile & Wright, 2021a; Heyde, Wille, et
al., 2023; Maaß et al., 2018). Notably, prior research findings question the utility of
examining narcissism variability without considering the more nuanced theoretical model
(Rogoza, Zajenkowski, et al., 2024). Examining the more homogeneous narcissistic domains,
Heyde, Wille, et al. (2023) reported ICCs for the grandiosity facets of admiration and rivalry.
They reported an ICC of .60 for admiration and .66 for rivalry. Despite Rogoza, Krammer, et
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 10
al. (2024) not explicitly providing ICCs for narcissistic domain states, their supplementary
materials disclose ICCs for the three lower-order domains, as assessed by the super-short
form of the Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory (FFNI-SSF). The ICCs for agentic extraversion
items ranged from .81 to .84, for self-centered antagonism, the ICCs fell between .72 and .78,
and for narcissistic neuroticism items, ICCs ranged from .65 to .78.2 To conclude, all studies
substantiate that narcissistic states exhibit momentary variability.
Still, narcissistic state variability seems to be less pronounced than variability in other
personality domains. To compare, ICCs for the Big Five typically yield smaller values,
ranging between .20 and .40 (e.g., Horstmann et al., 2021; Sherman et al., 2015). Another
example comes from interest states, whose ICCs are higher (around .50 to .70; Roemer et al.,
2021). Yet, regardless of the absolute ICC value, all studies found substantial and meaningful
within-person variance for narcissistic domains. Hence, examining narcissism from a state
perspective—recognizing both person and situational influences on narcissistic expressions—
seems fruitful.
Focusing on the three lower-order domains, the current study aims to examine
variability in narcissistic states within a standardized longitudinal context. This approach
offers a unique perspective compared to previous daily diary or experience sampling studies.
While those methods capture a wide range of situations and allow for natural variability, their
lack of standardization makes it challenging to assess situational influences accurately.
Conversely, experimental studies provide greater environmental control and enhance inter-
individual comparability, albeit at the cost of reduced situational variability. Notably,
Edershile et al. (2023) combined both approaches and found that individuals exhibit similar

submitted for publication; hence, we did not derive hypotheses from the study’s findings.
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 11
levels and variability in their grandiosity and vulnerability across naturalistic settings and a
single experimental session. Building on these findings, we will examine ICCs in the three
lower-order domains—agentic extraversion, self-centered antagonism, and narcissistic
neuroticism—in a longitudinal, experimental setting. Our investigation will not only focus on
the extent of narcissism variability but also explore how these state distributions assemble
around the trait level—as assessed by a dispositional measurement. This controlled,
longitudinal approach aims to provide a more fine-grained understanding of narcissistic state
variability.
Correlations Between Narcissistic Traits and Aggregated States
Previous research indicates that trait grandiosity and vulnerability scores have
medium- to large-sized associations with their corresponding average state scores (Edershile
& Wright, 2021a; Giacomin & Jordan, 2016a, 2016b; Maaß et al., 2018). Using data from a
daily diary, Giacomin and Jordan (2016a) report a correlation of r = .79 between narcissistic
traits (primarily grandiosity) and the corresponding daily state average. Making use of an
experience sampling design, Edershile and Wright (2021a) observed r = .39 [90% CI: .33;
.44] for the correlation between the grandiosity trait and the mean aggregated state, and r =
.31 [90% CI: .24; .37] for vulnerability. These estimates align with findings by Maaß et al.
(2018), who also reported a correlation of r =.35 [90% CI: .23, .45] between narcissistic traits
and aggregated state scores derived from experience sampling data.
While these two studies examined the trait-state relations in the two higher-order
domains, a recent study by Rogoza, Krammer, et al. (2024) explored the relations between
narcissistic states and traits in the three lower-order domains (i.e., TMN). Across various
samples and measurement instruments examined in naturalistic settings (i.e., daily diary or
experience sampling), the correlations between the agentic extraversion trait and states
ranged from r = .23 to r = .81. Similarly, the correlations between the narcissistic neuroticism
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 12
trait and corresponding states varied between r = .21 and r = .76. For the self-centered
antagonism trait and states, the authors report an association of r = .53. Notably, these
associations did not involve aggregated states.
The current study aims to extend the understanding of trait-aggregated state relations
to the three lower-order domains within an experimental setting (i.e., standardized online
group environments). By employing a standardized setup, we aim to improve the clarity and
interpretability of our results.
Correlations between Trait and State Variability in Narcissism
Whole Trait Theory suggests a relation between the trait and the distribution of states
(Fleeson & Jayawickreme, 2015). This bears the question of whether, next to the trait-
aggregated state relation, the trait also relates to the variability of the state distribution.
Edershile and Wright (2021a) examined relations between trait grandiosity and vulnerability
and the variability of their corresponding states in an experience sampling design. They
found no relation between grandiosity and its state variability. However, they identified a
moderate positive correlation (r = .20) between trait vulnerability and the variability in its
corresponding state. Again, we aim to extend these findings to the trifurcated structure (i.e.,
the three lower-order domains) and a standardized context.
Structural Composition of Narcissism at the State Level
Whole Trait Theory (Fleeson, 2001; Fleeson & Jayawickreme, 2015) mostly focuses
on how a single domain state can be aggregated to provide insights into the corresponding
trait. Consequently, we can assume that the between-person structural composition of
narcissism should be observable from state data only.
However, Whole Trait Theory does not address the correspondence between the
interrelations of two or more constructs at the between-and matching within-person level.
Implicitly, it is often assumed that the personality state structures should mirror trait
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 13
structures (e.g., Fleeson & Jayawickreme, 2015). This is also reflected in the prior narcissism
investigations, which examined identical state-level narcissistic domains that have been
established at the trait level (Edershile et al., 2019; Edershile & Wright, 2021a, 2021b;
Giacomin & Jordan, 2016b, 2016a; Heyde et al., 2023).
More explicitly, this assumption can be derived from the TESSERA framework.
TESSERA highlights the connection between long-term personality trait development and
recurring short-term variability (Wrzus & Roberts, 2017). Notably, TESSERA proposes that
personality domains experiencing similar situations are more likely to show correlated
changes than those encountering different or conflicting situations and states. In other words,
if two constructs are prone to manifest in the same situations, this suggests a connection in
their development. It can be inferred that state co-occurrence ultimately results in covariance
at the trait level. As such, TESSERA serves as a valuable guide to investigate the
correspondence between the established structural composition of narcissism at the trait level
and the structural composition that needs to be explored at the state level.
Few studies examined state-level associations between narcissistic domains that are at
the same hierarchical level, such as vulnerability and grandiosity. The associations reported
range from small- (r = .10; Edershile et al., 2019) to large-size associations (r = .64;
Edershile & Wright, 2021b), likely influenced by different measurement tools and situational
factors that naturalistic settings cannot control for. Rogoza, Krammer, et al. (2024) also
investigated the two-domain and three-domain structures of narcissism using state-level data
collected in naturalistic settings. Their findings indicated that narcissistic states consistently
reflect a structure analogous to that observed at the trait level across the examined situations.
However, while they explored both hierarchical levels of the narcissism model, they analyzed
the two orders separately.
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 14
The present study builds on previous research by moving beyond the isolated
investigation of two- and three-factor models of narcissism. We aim to provide a more
comprehensive understanding of narcissism’s hierarchical structure by testing its full
structural composition at the state level. Specifically, we seek to clarify how the two higher-
order domains of narcissism branch into the three lower-order domains. Unlike the previous
naturalistic approaches, data was collected in an experimental setting, minimizing confounds
because of uncontrolled situational elements (i.e., different situations between individuals)
(Balliet & Van Lange, 2013; Robinson, 2007).
Structural Composition Across Different Situational Contexts
The TESSERA framework offers a robust theoretical basis for investigating the
structural composition of narcissism at the state level across a wide range of situational
contexts. However, the structural composition of narcissistic states may vary depending on
the specific context. Prior studies on narcissistic state relations are limited in their ability to
address this issue due to uncontrolled situational factors in daily diary or experience sampling
designs. In contrast, the controlled experimental setting of the present study enables us to
draw nomothetic conclusions about the structural composition of narcissistic states in
different situational contexts.
Evidence from Big Five research suggests that the structural composition of
personality domains can differ between the trait and state levels. Specifically, Ringwald et al.
(2022) demonstrated that, while the trait-level structure of extraversion includes facets such
as boldness, talkativeness, assertiveness, and excitability, not all of these facets manifest at
the state level. Specifically, in their study boldness and talkativeness remained indicators of
state-level extraversion, but assertiveness and excitability did not. Consequently, momentary
expressions of extraversion may not consistently involve all the facets that comprise the trait-
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 15
level construct, as, for instance, different situations may not afford opportunities for certain
expressions. However, their naturalistic design prevents examining such a hypothesis.
The current study seeks to extend this line of inquiry to narcissism by examining
whether its structural composition at the state level mirrors that of the trait level in different
situational contexts. For instance, at the trait level grandiosity is made up of agentic
extraversion and partially self-centered antagonism. Yet these two aspects of grandiosity may
not consistently co-occur at the state level. In competitive environments, grandiosity might
predominantly manifest through antagonistic behaviors, while in more affiliative social
settings, it could be expressed through agentic behaviors without antagonism. By employing
standardized experimental conditions, this study allows for the examination of how the
structural composition of narcissistic states varies across different situational contexts,
enabling us to draw nomothetic conclusions regarding these variations.
Research Objectives and Key Questions
The current study aims to gain a better understanding of narcissistic states, focusing
on the structural relations of narcissistic domains as they play out in online group
interactions. We aim to generalize and extend findings on variability and trait-state relations
using a standardized setting. We will investigate the variability within the three lower-order
narcissistic domains (RQ1. How much intraindividual variation exists in narcissistic domain
states in standardized social situations?), the correspondences between aggregated
narcissistic states and traits (RQ2a. How strong is the relation between trait narcissistic
domain scores and the corresponding aggregated narcissism state scores?), as well as the
relations between narcissism’s state-level variability and the corresponding traits (RQ2b.
How strong is the relation between trait narcissistic domain scores and the variability in the
corresponding narcissism state scores?). Moreover, we will examine the structural
composition of narcissism at the state and trait level using state data (RQ3a. Can the assumed
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 16
hierarchical narcissism structure be found at the state and trait level when modeling state
data only? RQ3b. Are the domain relations magnitude comparable across both the state and
trait level?). Specifically, while we are interested in examining this structure across all
measurement points, we will explore whether the structural dimensions of narcissism remain
consistent across affiliative and controversial contexts (RQ4: Does the structure of narcissism
differ between affiliative and controversial contexts?)
Experimental Design: Standardized Online Group Interactions
The current study uses data from an experimental, longitudinal study. Over the course
of six weeks, participants met once a week in groups of three to four via Zoom. The groups
were randomized so that participants did not know one another before the onset of the study.
The meetings lasted approximately one hour each and comprised predefined topics. During
the initial three meetings, participants engaged in affiliative tasks, such as posing
predetermined questions to foster closeness (e.g., “Who would you like to have dinner
with?”). Conversely, the last three meetings involved tasks that had a higher likelihood of
generating controversy, such as assigning positive and negative adjectives to group members,
thus aiming for less affiliative interactions.3 As such, participants were engaged in activities
mirroring the natural introduction process, from self-introductions and cooperative activities
to political debates and group decision games.
Intraindividual Variability in Narcissistic States
Based on the observed ICCs for various narcissistic domains, we anticipate finding
ICCs that align with previous studies (Crowe et al., 2018; Edershile et al., 2019; Edershile &
Wright, 2021a; Heyde, Wille, et al., 2023; Maaß et al., 2018; Rogoza, Krammer, et al., 2024).
Specifically, for agentic extraversion, we expect to find ICCs that fall within the moderate to
3 The exact tasks per session can be found in the project’s OSF.
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 17
high range, consistent with earlier findings on grandiosity and admiration. Similarly,
for narcissistic neuroticism, we expect ICCs to be comparable to the moderate to high
range previously documented for vulnerability. For self-centered antagonism, we predict
ICCs similar to those reported for this domain and rivalry, likely falling within the high
range. Importantly, in line with prior research, we expect to observe less within-person
variability in narcissistic states compared to the Big Five domains, which typically yield
lower ICCs. Lastly, we extend previous research by examining whether the observed
variability in narcissistic domains occurs around, above, or below the corresponding trait
score—as assessed by a one-time dispositional measurement. This investigation will offer
valuable insights into the interplay of narcissistic traits and states, and their manifestation
within individuals over time.
Correspondence Between Narcissistic Traits and States
We expect to find medium-size associations in the trait-aggregated state relations
within the three lower-order narcissistic domains, comparable to previous findings in the two
higher-order domains (Edershile & Wright, 2021a; Maaß et al., 2018). Moreover, we
anticipate that the relations between trait and state variability will exhibit a similar magnitude
as reported by Edershile and Wright (2021a), characterized by small effect sizes, across all
three lower-order domains of narcissism.
Hierarchical Structural Composition of Narcissism: Trait and State-Level Analysis
In line with Whole Trait Theory, we will use the same state data to derive structural
compositions of narcissism at the within- and between-person level (e.g., Wright et al., 2015).
At the between-person level, we anticipate deriving similar associations as previously
reported from trait data (Crowe et al., 2019). Specifically, we expect medium-sized
associations between grandiosity and vulnerability. Moreover, we expect to find medium-
sized associations between self-centered antagonism and narcissistic neuroticism, as well as
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 18
agentic extraversion, while the latter two domains should have slightly smaller associations.
Moreover, at the between-person level, we anticipate agentic extraversion to reflect
grandiosity and narcissistic neuroticism to reflect vulnerability, with large-sized loadings.
Self-centered antagonism is expected to exhibit medium to large-sized loadings with both
higher-order domains. In line with previous research (Edershile et al., 2019; Edershile &
Wright, 2021b; Rogoza et al., 2024) and the suggestion of the TESSERA framework, we
anticipate similar patterns at the state level when modeling the structure across all
measurement points.
Structural Composition of Narcissism: Affiliative vs Controversial Contexts
The experimental research design enables us to examine the nomothetic structural
composition of narcissism across two different standardized contexts. Consequently, we will
examine the between- and within-person narcissism structure in an affiliative and zero-
acquaintance setting and a more controversial, acquainted context. This analysis will be
exploratory, as suggested by an anonymous reviewer.
Methods
The current study used data from a larger project funded by the German Research Foundation
(ZI 1792/9-1). The general setup of the study followed the design by Paulhus (1998).
Participants met in groups of up to four people weekly and discussed pre-defined topics for a
total of six consecutive online meetings. Beyond the variables included in the current study,
other constructs were assessed, including other antagonistic personality traits (i.e.,
Psychopathy and Machiavellianism), situation perception, and interpersonal perceptions, such
as behavioral perceptions, likeability, similarity, and authority.4 These variables will not be

included here as our focus is on the manifestation of narcissistic domains at the trait and state
level.
Participants
A total of 385 participants provided trait data. State data were collected for 220
people. As pre-registered, data from participants who (i) had more than 25% missing
responses, (ii) had no variance across all narcissism questionnaires at one measurement point,
or (iii) participated in less than four group meetings (i.e., 12 assessment points) was
excluded. Furthermore, we excluded single reports if they had more than 20% missing
values. After applying our preregistered exclusion criteria, we included a total of 189
participants5 (72.49% female, 26.46% male, and 1.06% identifying as other) in the final
dataset. These participants contributed to a total of 3,131 measurement occasions (M
assessment
= 16.57, SD = 1.92). The average age of the final sample was 24.48 years
points assessment points
(SD = 3.88).
Participants were recruited through two different channels. Firstly, the experiment
was advertised on Facebook and different department websites of the University.
Additionally, we used an email list comprising individuals who had expressed interest in
participating in psychological research, to directly email participants. Second, potential
participants were approached on the University campus by research assistants distributing
flyers advertising the experiment. To be included in the study, participants had to be between
18 and 35 years old. This age range was chosen as it was assumed that people closer in age
are more likely to develop or be motivated to build friendships (of relevance to the bigger
project). Some additional inclusion criteria were applied: German language level had to be at

indicated a power of .99.

least C1 to enable participants to speak fluently and to discuss more difficult topics with their
group members. Participants were not allowed to know each other in advance of the study.
Participants received monetary compensation for their participation in the study. The ethics
committee of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Psychologie (MZ 012017_amd_052015_2)
approved all procedures.
Procedure
The study follows an experimental longitudinal design. For this, we followed the
design by Paulhus (1998). However, in contrast to this prior work, all meetings were held
online. During a first session, recruited participants were asked to complete a larger test
battery, including trait measures of narcissism. They were then assigned to a group depending
on their availabilities and fulfilling the condition that they did not know any other group
members prior to the first meeting. As outlined in the introduction, they met weekly for a
total of 6 group meetings. The sessions were designed in such a way that people were
engaged in more affiliative conversation topics and tasks in the first three sessions. In
contrast, the last three sessions entailed more controversial tasks to potentially elicit
discussions. Narcissistic state measurements were taken before, in the middle of, and after the
group sessions. All meetings were recorded.
Materials
The codebook containing all measures and items necessary for the replication of the
the data is available on request only, as further papers using the data are pending. As soon as
they are published, the data will be available in this project folder. To test the assumed
hierarchical structure, all state items had to be allocated to agentic extraversion, self-centered
antagonism, or narcissistic neuroticism. The detailed classification of scales and their items to
narcissistic domains was not pre-registered. However, we based this assignment on the
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 21
findings by Crowe et al. (2019).6 To measure agentic extraversion, we used the short version
of the Five Factor Narcissism Inventory (FFNI-SF; Sherman et al., 2015) subscales of
acclaim‐seeking, authoritativeness, exhibitionism, grandiose fantasies, indifference,
manipulativeness, as well as the admiration subscale of the Narcissistic Admiration and
Rivalry Questionnaire - Short Scale (NARQ-S; Leckelt et al., 2018). Despite originally being
constructed to assess grandiosity, we also made use of the Narcissistic Grandiosity Scale
(NGS; Rosenthal et al., 2007) as an indicator for agentic extraversion, as well as the
exploitative and self‐sacrificing self-enhancement 7 subscales of the Pathological Narcissism
Inventory (PNI-54; Pincus et al., 2009). To measure self-centered antagonism, we used the
FFNI-SF subscales of arrogance, entitlement, exploitativeness, lack of empathy, thrill-
seeking, and the NARQ-S rivalry subscale. Finally, to measure narcissistic neuroticism, we
made use of the FFNI-SF subscales of distrust, need for admiration, reactive anger, and
shame. In addition, we used the remaining PNI-54 subscales and the Narcissistic
Vulnerability Scale8 (NVS; Crowe et al., 2018) as indicators of narcissistic neuroticism.
Trait measures
The measures described below were used to assess narcissistic domains at the trait
level. Additionally, we assessed the Big Five to compare results for those constructs with
prior research and thereby augment the quality of our data interpretation. Specifically, we aim
to investigate whether the ICCs and trait-state correlations observed within the Big Five align
with previously reported values. This investigation enables us to ascertain whether the ICCs
supplement.
7 Although Crowe et al. (2019) reported a slightly higher loading of self‐sacrificing self-enhancement subscale
on agentic extraversion than on narcissistic neuroticism, the loadings were not significantly different. Hence, we
decided to allocate this sub-scale in line with how it was originally intended by Wright et al. (2010).
8 Although the NVS was not included in the main analysis by Crowe et al. (2019), their supplementary analysis
indicated that the 11-item NVS is appropriate to assess narcissistic neuroticism with r = .64.
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 22
and trait-aggregated state correlations detected for narcissism are not solely attributable to the
specifics of our sample and research design. Descriptives and reliability estimates for all
measures can be found in Tables 1 and 2.
Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory - short version (FFNI-SF; Sherman et al., 2015;
German translation by Wehner et al., 2021). The FFNI-SF is a self-report measure, which has
a total of 62 items across 15 sub-scales. The FFNI is an appropriate measure to assess the
trifurcated structure of narcissism (Crowe et al., 2019; Miller et al., 2016). Participants rated
the extent to which they agreed to different statements on a six-point rating scale, with the
end-point designations “strongly disagree” (1) and “strongly agree” (6). Items included were,
for example, “I only associate with people of my caliber” and “I often fantasize about
someday being famous”. The internal consistency estimates of the fifteen-facet sub-scale
scores ranged from ω = .62 for reactive anger and arrogance to ω = .91 for exploitativeness.
Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI-54; Pincus et al., 2009; German version by
Morf et al., 2017). The PNI is a self-report measure assessing seven dimensions of
Pathological Narcissism (Pincus et al., 2009). The scale includes a total of seven sub-scales to
assess vulnerability and grandiosity. Crowe et al. (2019) identified the exploitativeness and
self‐sacrificing self-enhancement subscales to be indicative of agentic extraversion, whereas
all the other sub-scales assess narcissistic neuroticism. We used the PNI sub-scales in
accordance with these findings. Participants rated the extent to which they agreed with
different statements on a six-point rating scale, with the end-point designations “not at all like
me” (1) and “very much like me” (6). Items included were, for example, “I sometimes need
important others in my life to reassure me of my self-worth” and “I can make anyone believe
anything I want them to”. The internal consistencies of the seven-facet subscale scores were
estimated to range between ω = .76 for self‐sacrificing self-enhancement and ω = .90 for
contingent self-esteem.
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 23
Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire - Short Scale (NARQ-S;
Leckelt et al., 2018). The NARQ-S is a six-item assessment tool that differentiates between
the admiration and rivalry dimensions of narcissism (Back et al., 2013). The NARQ-S has
one sub-scale per dimension, with three items each, reflecting narcissism’s affective-
motivational, cognitive, and behavioral processes. The scale captures the agentic and
antagonistic aspects of narcissism for which it was constructed (Crowe et al., 2019). The
current study included rivalry to define self-centered antagonism, while admiration assessed
agentic extraversion in the TMN. Participants rated the extent to which they agreed with
different statements on a six-point rating scale, with the end-point designations “not agree at
all” (1) and “agree completely” (6). Items included were, for example, “I deserve to be seen
as a great personality” and “Most people are somehow losers.” For each participant, a
narcissistic domain score was calculated, by averaging the items per person in each facet
subscale (i.e., the admiration subscale was used to assess the agentic extraversion domain,
and the rivalry subscale was used to assess the domain of self-centered antagonism). The
estimated internal consistency of the rivalry sub-scale scores was ω = .64 and of the
admiration sub-scale score ω = .79.
Big Five Inventory (BFI-2; Soto & John, 2017; German version by Danner et al.,
2019). The BFI-2 is a 60-item personality inventory to assess the Big Five: Extraversion,
Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Open Mindedness and Neuroticism. The inventory
assesses a total of 15 personality sub-domains, which are assigned to the five personality
domains. Participants rated the extent to which they agreed with different statements on a
five-point rating scale, with the end-point designations “disagree strongly (1) and “agree
strongly” (6). Items included were, for example, “I am full of energy” and “I am complex, a
deep thinker.” The internal consistencies of the different domain scale scores were estimated
to range between ω = .75 for agreeableness and ω = .90 for neuroticism.

State Measurements
We employed a planned missingness design for state assessments to reduce burden
but ensure content coverage (Silvia et al., 2014). Narcissistic trait measurements were
adapted to measure narcissism at the state level using all six items from the NARQ-S and a
total of 18 items from the FFNI-SF and PNI-54 (so 9 out of the initial 62 and 9 out of the
initial 54 items, respectively). To this purpose, participants were asked to complete the items
as follows: “Please provide your answer that best corresponds to your agreement or
disagreement AT THE MOMENT.” Two anchor items per narcissistic domain were
presented at each measurement occasion. The third item per domain was chosen randomly
from the remaining items. Anchor items were chosen based on their centrality and loading
(Crowe et al., 2019), as well as their theoretical importance for the narcissistic domain.
Random items were selected from the remaining items assessing the domain of interest. Due
to a technical error, the random item was not always chosen among the remaining items of
the same domain. This issue results in an unbalanced number of items per narcissistic
domain. Rogoza, Krammer, et al. (2024) validated abbreviated versions of the FFNI-SF and
PNI-54, specifically the FFNI-SSF (Packer West et al., 2021) and Super-Brief Pathological
Narcissism Inventory (SB-PNI; Schoenleber et al., 2015), in state-level data. Our data
collection and pre-registration preceded the publication of their study, resulting in only a
partial overlap between our items and those validated in their research. Nevertheless, the
results provided by Rogoza, Krammer, et al. (2024) provide support for the operationalization
chosen in the current study.
Narcissistic Grandiosity Scale (NGS; Rosenthal et al., 2007; Crowe et al., 2016).
The questionnaire was translated into German using back-translations by two individuals.
Any discrepancies were resolved with the assistance of one of the authors of this paper. The
NGS is a 16-item adjective-based narcissism scale. The questionnaire has a unidimensional
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 25
structure and only assesses agentic extraversion (Crowe et al., 2016; Rogoza, Krammer, et
al., 2024). The measure has been shown to perform well psychometrically at the state and
trait level, emphasizing its usefulness for momentary assessment (Edershile et al., 2019;
Rogoza, Krammer, et al., 2024). Participants rated the extent to which they related to
different adjectives at this moment in time on a seven-point rating scale, with the end-point
designations “disagree strongly” (1) and “agree strongly” (6). Adjectives included were, for
example, authoritative, unrivalled, brilliant, and extraordinary.
Narcissistic Vulnerability Scale (NVS; Crowe et al., 2018). The questionnaire was
translated into German using back-translations, as described for the NGS. The Narcissistic
Vulnerability Scale is an 11-item adjective-based narcissism scale. In line with a recent study
by Rogoza, Krammer, et al. (2024), we used the scale to examine narcissistic neuroticism.
The NVS has been validated for momentary assessment, indicating that the measure performs
well psychometrically at the state and trait level (Edershile et al., 2019). Participants were
presented with the adjectives with the instructions to rate the extent to which the term
described themselves at this moment on a seven-point rating scale, with the end-point
designations “disagree strongly” (1) and “agree strongly” (6). Adjectives included were, for
example, fragile, self-absorbed, irritable, and vengeful.
Big Five Personality State Scale (Ringwald et al., 2022). The Big Five personality
state scale is a 10-item daily Big Five questionnaire, with two items per domain. The
questionnaire was developed to assess personality states in intensive longitudinal studies.
Participants were presented with a rating scale that had one adjective at each endpoint. They
were asked to rate the extent to which the term described themselves at this moment on a
seven-point rating scale. For example, talkative describes extremely well (1), both describe
equally well (4), silent describes extremely well (7). Upper-end adjectives included were, for
example, energetic, tense, trustful, and curious.

Data Preparation and Analyses
The analyses outlined in this section were preregistered and all deviations from the
preregistration are made explicit in a supplementary document in the OSF.9 Statistical
analyses were conducted in R (v.4.2.2; R Core Team, 2022) with the packages tidyverse (v.
1.3.2; Wickham et al., 2019), lme4 (v. 1.1.32; Bates et al., 2014), lavaan (v. 0.6.15; Rosseel,
2012), and bootnet (v.1.5; Epskamp et al., 2018). The R code and supplementary material are
Data pre-processing and preliminary analyses. For the ICC, we computed multilevel
linear models for comparability with prior research. The ICC was calculated by dividing the
between-person variance by the total variance.
Multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA). To test whether state and trait
levels yield the same factor structures, multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA) was
used. MCFA accounts for the nesting of the measurement occasions (level 1) within
participants (level 2). Latent factors were identified by fixing the loading of the first indicator
to one, except for the hierarchical fitting where indicators were latent variables. Additionally,
when a latent factor only had two indicators, both were fixed to one. We did not person-mean
center the variables, as Ryu (2015) indicated that centering has little influence on the model
parameters in MCFA, particularly for the covariance structure. To account for non-normality,
the models were estimated using robust maximum likelihood (MLR) estimation. Moreover,
the use of MLR is deemed superior in cases where latent variable modeling involves ordinal
response variable data (Bandalos, 2014; Li, 2016).
Model specification and estimation. In the first step, we fitted individual MCFA
models for each instrument (i.e., FFNI-SF, PNI, NARQ-S, NGS, and NVS) and their
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 27
corresponding domains at the state (within-person) and trait (between-person) level.
Following, we fitted three measurement models, one for each of the lower-order narcissistic
domains (i.e., agentic extraversion, self-centered antagonism, and narcissistic neuroticism).
Next, we fitted models for the TMN conceptualization of narcissism, to examine the
correlations between the domains at the state and trait level. Moreover, we fitted the
hierarchical models of narcissism at both levels of analysis. Following the suggestion of an
anonymous reviewer, we proceeded to conduct separate analyses for the three affiliative and
the three controversial situations. Specifically, two models were examined for the first three
sessions, and two additional models were scrutinized for the last three sessions. The models
for the questionnaires were fitted with the single items, all other models were fitted with the
questionnaire means as indicators for the latent variables. Each model was fitted separately
for the state and trait level. As pointed out by Ryu and West (2009) this is relevant in MCFA
because the sample sizes differ considerably between levels. This was accomplished by
specifying the model at one level while saturating the model (i.e., estimating all possible
variances and covariances freely) at the other level.
Model evaluation. To evaluate the goodness of fit of the partially saturated models,
we followed Ryu and West (2009) and estimated the level-specific CFI, RMSEA, and
SRMR. We defined an acceptable model fit in terms of standard cut-offs for single-level
factor analysis (CFI > .95, RMSEA < .06 SRMR <.08; Hu & Bentler, 1999) in our pre-
registration.
Deviations from pre-registration
Next to the research questions addressed in this paper, we initially pre-registered our
intention to explore the role of situation perception. However, to maintain the focus of this
publication, we have chosen to defer the analysis of situation perception to a separate paper.
Furthermore, our approach to examining the relations between the two- and three-factor
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 28
models of narcissism—specifically, between grandiose and vulnerability and the TMN
domains—was pre-registered with slight variations. Initially, we chose to view these two
models as distinct conceptualizations, given their separate assessments. However, in theory,
they represent an intertwined hierarchical structure. Consequently, our modeling approach
deviated from the pre-registered plan. Instead of fitting separate models for grandiosity and
vulnerability, we analyzed hierarchical models encompassing both narcissism
conceptualization levels. Finally, RQ2b emerged from the suggestion of an anonymous
reviewer and therefore stands as the sole research question that was not pre-registered.

arrogance, entitlement, exploitativeness, lack of empathy, and thrill-seeking were used for self-centered
antagonism, and distrust, need for admiration, reactive anger, and shame were used for narcissistic neuroticism.
For the PNI-54, the exploitativeness and self‐sacrificing self-enhancement subscales were used to assess agentic
extraversion, with the remaining subscales assessing narcissistic neuroticism.

Note. N = 189. ICC = Intra-class correlation. No trait-aggregated state correlations can be indicated for the
NGS and NVS, as they have only been used to assess states. The weighted omegas were computed in the MCFA
at the within-person level. All trait-aggregated state correlations are significant at p < .001.
RQ1: Intraindividual Variation in Narcissistic domain States
First, we investigated the variance at the within- and between-person level. For
comparability with prior research, we examined the ICCs making use of a multilevel model
approach. We computed ICCs for every domain and questionnaire mean score, as well as for
variance is more determined by differences between persons than within persons. For the Big
Five states, reported here for comparison reasons, the opposite holds true. Confidence
intervals for the narcissism ICCs do not always overlap, yet differences seem negligible as no
because the inclusion of the collapsed random item slightly attenuates the total ICC.
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 30
lower bound CI lies below .5, supporting the conclusion that most variance is observed at the
between-person level in this context. This is in line with our expectations and supports the
notion that prior findings can be generalized to a video-based online social situation.
As an illustration of the within-person variability and how it varies across
participants, we display the momentary reported scores for agentic extraversion and
Neuroticism from a Randomly Drawn Subset.
Note. The narcissistic domains displayed were assessed by the FFNI-SF. The subscales of acclaim-seeking,
authoritativeness, exhibitionism, grandiose fantasies, indifference, and manipulativeness assessed agentic
extraversion, while the subscales of distrust, need for admiration, reactive anger, and shame were used for
narcissistic neuroticism.
RQ2a: Trait-Aggregated State Relations
Correlations between domain traits and corresponding aggregated states can be found in
(mean r = .43). This relation for trait-aggregated states for narcissism align with our
expectations. The relations between traits, aggregated states, and non-aggregated states are
defined by multiple questionnaires) can be found in Appendix A.
12 The average correlation is computed across all three domains and all instruments, including the NGS and
NVS. The specific trait-state correlation for agentic extraversion (including the NGS) was r = .58, for self-
centered antagonism was r =.61, and for narcissistic neuroticism (including the NVS) was r = .59.
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 31
most, but not all, of the individual state ratings, vary below their corresponding trait levels.
On the contrary, when it comes to extraversion—a component of the Big Five personality
traits—a different pattern emerges: the aggregated states appear to vary both below and
above their corresponding trait level. The same trend holds true for the remaining Big Five
personality traits.
Note. Bold black dots indicate person-aggregated states, and thin gray dots indicate single, single non-
aggregated state reports. All narcissism measurements were assessed on a six-point scale; hence, we could plot
the graphs making use of all the instruments assessing the displayed domain on the trait and state level. For the
Big Five, the trait measures were on a six-point scale, while the state measures were on a seven-point scale. For
the graphical representation, the state scale was transformed from a seven-point scale to a six-point scale by
merging the lower-end ratings together.
RQ2b: Relation between Narcissistic Trait and State Variability
For research question two, we examined the associations between narcissistic domain
traits and their variability in state expressions, utilizing individual standard deviations to
assess variability. Our analysis revealed significant Pearson’s correlations: r = .50 for agentic
13 The not re-scaled graphs for all Big Five trait-aggregated states can be found in Appendix A.
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 32
extraversion, r = .49 for self-centered antagonism, and r = .53 for narcissistic neuroticism
(all p < .001). These correlations suggest that individuals with higher trait scores tend to
exhibit greater variability in state expressions across these domains. These findings closely
mirror the trait-aggregated state correlations, mentioned above. Furthermore, partial
correlations, controlling for aggregated state narcissism, showed reduced but significant
associations, indicating a relation between trait scores and state variability independent of the
average state level: r = .25 for agentic extraversion, r = .14 for self-centered antagonism, and
r = .25 for narcissistic neuroticism (all p < .001). This analysis highlights a correlation
between traits and the range of state expressions, separate from their average levels.
RQ3: Within- and Between-Person Structural Composition of Narcissism in State Data
In the final step, we fitted multiple MCFA models, as described in the methods
section. The measurement models, as well as the individual domain models, were fitted as
presented in the OSF materials. In the total hierarchical model at the trait level, we
encountered two Heywood cases in the upper boundary of the confidence intervals, most
likely due to multicollinearity (Rindskopf, 1984), which were fixed by setting the residuals of
all three TMN domains to (1-reliability estimate)*variance (Bollen, 1989). Tables 3 and 4
present the model fits. Hopwood and Donnellan (2010) have pointed out that in the context of
personality trait inventories, it is difficult to find well-fitting models. Their findings suggest
at least lowering the cutoff criteria to CFI ≥ .90 and the RMSEA < .10. Additionally, multiple
parameters, such as sample size, size of factor loadings, or the number of items per latent
variable, can affect cut-offs for fit indices (Heene et al., 2011). Our findings indicate that the
assumed hierarchical structure fits well at the trait level, further corroborating prior work.
Model fit at the state level was still satisfactory but less good. Overall, in line with our
expectation, this suggests that a similar structure can be observed at trait and state levels.

Further, we compared the relations among and across the two-domain and three-
vulnerability, as well as the TMN domain loadings on these two domains at the trait and state
level. At the trait level, the association between vulnerability and grandiosity is moderate
with r = .52. Across the higher- and lower-order narcissistic domains, the associations found
at the trait level are as follows: Narcissistic neuroticism appears to reflect vulnerability with a
loading of a =.94. Similarly, agentic extraversion reflects grandiosity (a = .97). Although
self-centered antagonism seems to be more related to grandiosity (a = .69), it also is
influenced by vulnerability (a = .34). At the state level, we made similar observations. The
association between vulnerability and grandiosity is moderate with r = .57. Again,
narcissistic neuroticism branches off from vulnerability with a = .97. In addition, agentic
extraversion seems to largely reflect grandiosity with a = .71, however, this loading is less
pronounced than at the trait level. Still, confidence intervals overlap. Similarly, to our
findings at the trait level, self-centered antagonism seems to be more related to grandiosity (a
= .79), than to vulnerability (a = .19). Notably, although the associations at the trait level
were all significant, the association between vulnerability and self-centered antagonism at the
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 34
state level was not. However, as before, the confidence intervals for the trait and state level
loading overlap. Besides the freely estimated models, we made attempts to integrate a state
model that imposed Level 2 estimates. In this process, we encountered several Heywood
cases, which we resolved by adjusting the residuals of all three TMN domains to (1 -
reliability estimate) * variance (Bollen, 1989). The outcome revealed a significant decline in
model fit, with a CFI of .24, RMSEA of .21, and SRMR of .37. This indicates that the
interrelations between the domains at these two analytical levels are not strictly identical.
In addition, we examined the correlations among the three lower-order domains at
centered antagonism is similarly associated with agentic extraversion and narcissistic
neuroticism. Though the point estimate indicates a slightly higher association with agentic
extraversion (r = .75 compared to r = .58), the confidence intervals between the two
associations suggest no significant difference. When it comes to agentic extraversion, our
results indicate that the domain has a stronger association with self-centered antagonism (r =
.75) than with narcissistic neuroticism (r = .48), with no overlapping confidence intervals. At
the state level, similar observations can be made. Self-centered antagonism is almost
identically associated with agentic extraversion (r = .64) and narcissistic neuroticism (r =
.62). Again, our findings indicate that agentic extraversion has a stronger association with
self-centered antagonism (r = .64) than with narcissistic neuroticism (r = .39), with no
overlapping confidence intervals. At both the trait and state level, self-centered antagonism
plays a central role within the TMN conceptualization.

Discussion
The present study examined narcissism state manifestations in online social group settings:
their level of variability, their relation to the corresponding trait, and their structural
composition. Drawing from recent research, we conceptualized narcissism hierarchically,
with grandiosity and vulnerability branching off into agentic extraversion, self-centered
antagonism, and narcissistic neuroticism. In line with our expectations and previous findings,
our results, derived from data obtained in standardized situations, show that narcissistic states
vary less than the Big Five. Moreover, the trait level often seemed to act as an upper
boundary for the average state levels. Lastly, we found moderate trait-aggregated state
relations and moderate associations between trait and state variability. These findings are in
line with our expectations. They show that narcissism variability and trait-state relations
reported from ESM data can be generalized to a standardized social setting.
Following Whole Trait Theory (Fleeson, 2001; Fleeson & Jayawickreme, 2015), we
employed state ratings to specify and test a multilevel confirmatory factor analysis, enabling
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 38
us to test whether the presumed hierarchical structural composition of narcissism emerges
from state data. The findings showed that the higher- and lower-order domain structures are
discernible in state data, at both the within- and between-person levels. Moreover, it can be
concluded that the hierarchical structure of narcissism—with the lower-order domains
branching off the higher-order domains—is also predominantly evident in state data. The
findings from the condition-specific analyses revealed slightly different results. While the
structural composition of narcissism at the between-person largely mirrored the structure
across all sessions, the narcissism state structure across affiliative versus controversial
situations differed. Specifically, in affiliative contexts, grandiosity manifested exclusively
through agentic extraversion, with no expression through self-centered antagonism.
Moreover, in controversial settings, agentic extraversion and narcissistic neuroticism
exhibited a slight negative association, contrasting the positive association observed across
all group meetings.
In sum, at least in the situational context of our study, the narcissism structure at the
within- and between-person level largely overlapped, however in more specific situational
contexts the state-level structures diverged from the trait-level structure in theoretically
reasonable ways.
Intraindividual Variability in Narcissistic States
For our first research question, we examined state variability in the three lower-order
narcissistic domains. In line with recent approaches in personality research (Horstmann et al.,
2021; Sherman et al., 2015), our findings indicate meaningful and substantial variability in
narcissistic states. More specifically, 20% to 44% of narcissistic state variance could be
explained by within-person differences. These findings replicate results of within-person
variance in grandiosity and vulnerability, as well as the TMN domains (Crowe et al., 2018;
Edershile et al., 2019, 2023; Edershile & Wright, 2021a; Maaß et al., 2018; Rogoza,
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 39
Krammer, et al., 2024). Notably, we could generalize these findings to a standardized
longitudinal context. Following, even subtle variations in situations within a standardized
environment relate to discernible changes in narcissistic domain states. This finding suggests
that habitual settings, despite their consistency, afford diverse expressions of narcissism. That
is, variability in narcissistic states is not contingent upon drastic changes in situations but
rather can manifest within repetitive (i.e., online meetings with the same interaction partners)
or routine contexts, highlighting the momentary and variable nature of narcissism.
Still, the observed within-person variance is lower than the variability in the Big Five.
Our results indicate that for the Big Five, 43% to 71% of state variance is at the within-
person level, which aligns with previous findings (e.g., Horstmann et al., 2021). This
replication of previous ESM findings demonstrates no general reduction in the variation of
personality states in our data, making it unlikely to solely be attributable to the standardized
situation. An interesting observation is that agreeableness, the Big Five dimension that shows
negative associations with all three narcissistic domains (Crowe et al., 2019), exhibits the
highest ICC of all Big Five dimensions. Our findings corroborate the concept that
narcissistic domains exhibit momentary manifestations with substantial within-person
variability. However, this variability is less pronounced compared to the Big Five personality
dimensions.
Narcissistic Trait-State Relations
For research question two, we examined the narcissistic trait-state relations. In line
with our expectations, our analyses revealed moderate trait-aggregated state relations and
moderate associations between trait and state variability for all three lower-order domains.
These findings illustrate the versatile role of narcissistic traits, influencing both consistent
state expressions, as reflected in aggregated states, and the variation in those expressions.
Notably, the correlations suggested that the mechanisms linking trait narcissism to variability
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 40
are, at least partially, different from those affecting the average expressions, and the other
way around.
The Goal Focus of Narcissistic State Expressions
Narcissism, particularly in its grandiose manifestations, is primarily characterized by
two key motivational goals: the pursuit of a grandiose self-image, associated with agentic
extraversion, and its protection, linked to self-centered antagonism (Grapsas et al., 2020;
Back et al., 2013; Morf & Rhodewalt, 2001). While vulnerable aspects of narcissism—
narcissistic neuroticism—also focus on self-protection, however, they are more oriented
towards safeguarding fragile self-esteem. Consequently, the underlying goal of narcissistic
behavior consistently centers on maintaining self-worth, whether through actively pursuing a
grandiose self-view or avoiding potential loss of status or esteem. This self-worth-focused
goal may be relevant across various situations, particularly for individuals who prioritize it.
According to narcissism theories, these individuals typically have higher narcissism scores.
In contrast, individuals with lower narcissism scores may not prioritize these goals,
regardless of the situation, and consequently seldom experience states aimed at their
achievement. This avoidance may be partly influenced by the predominantly negative
connotations associated with narcissistic traits (e.g., Carlson et al., 2011). A potential
explanation for both the reduced variation in narcissistic states (compared to the Big Five)
and the trait level boundary for state expressions may be the goal-focused (i.e., instrumental)
nature of narcissism.
Given the heterogeneity of narcissism, we propose the following reasonings for the
different narcissistic domains: Agentic extraversion primarily drives narcissistic behaviors
aimed at achieving a grandiose self-image (Back, 2018). The persistent need for self-
promotion and enhancement may explain the reduced within-person variability in agentic
extraversion. Maaß and Ziegler (2017) support this, showing that individuals high in
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 41
grandiose narcissism promote themselves favorably across various situations. Similarly, self-
centered antagonism involves protective behaviors to fend off criticism and protect the
grandiose self-image (Back, 2018). Once more, there may be a consistent baseline established
to maintain this grandiose self-image, resulting in reduced variability within this domain.
Despite the contrasting correlates observed in narcissistic neuroticism (Crowe et al., 2019;
Krizan & Herlache, 2018; Miller et al., 2016), it is similarly driven by a self-worth-focused
goal as the other two domains. This shared underlying motivation centered on self-worth,
albeit manifested through safeguarding fragile self-esteem, may similarly account for the
reduced variation observed in narcissistic behaviors across different forms of narcissism.
After all, narcissism’s momentary manifestations appear to be instrumental and contingent on
individual differences in the importance attributed to narcissism-related goals, as evidenced
in the trait level boundaries.
Trait-Level Boundaries in Narcissistic State Expressions
Our results show that narcissistic state expressions are largely constrained by their
corresponding trait level—as assessed by a one-time dispositional measurement. More
precisely, the aggregated states typically fall below the respective trait level. This pattern
contrasts the ideas of the Whole Trait Theory (e.g., Fleeson, 2001) and previous findings of
the Big Five, which have been shown to vary around their respective trait level. The
momentary expressions of the Big Five are shaped by an interplay of trait levels (representing
functional goals) and situational contexts (Horstmann et al., 2021). For instance, individuals
tend to display extraverted behavior when they aim to achieve extraversion-related
objectives, such as making new friends, and exhibit more introverted behavior when these
goals are not relevant (McCabe & Fleeson, 2012). Thus, extraverted behavioral expressions
(i.e. situational goals) are contingent on the individual’s traits and the immediate situation.
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 42
In contrast, narcissistic states seem to have a more consistent goal focus, with
expressions above the trait level rarely occurring. A similar “ceiling effect” has been
observed in other constructs, such as vocational interests (Roemer et al., 2021, 2023). This
effect has been interpreted using the instrumentality hypothesis, which posits that the trait
exerts a more substantial influence on momentary expression than the situational context. For
interests, this means that the situational specifics rarely override an individual’s inherent lack
of interest in a particular activity. This aligns with our suggestion that for narcissism, the
fundamental goal—whether or not it is important to the individual—plays a more crucial role
in determining behavior than the specific situation. In other words, the situational context
seldom overrides the significance dictated by the trait.
In summary, while the importance of narcissistic goals may vary between individuals,
narcissistic expressions are likely more consistent within individuals over time compared to
Big Five expressions. Further, we propose that the extent of narcissistic state manifestations
is limited by the importance attributed to these goals which is reflected in the trait level.
These findings suggest distinct psychological processes underlying the manifestations of
narcissism and the Big Five traits.
Contextual Constraints on Narcissistic State Variability
The variability in narcissistic states evidences an interactional process between person
and situational context. We prioritize explaining the limited variability—compared to the Big
Five—and the trait-level boundary by the goal-focused nature of narcissism. Especially, as
the observed variability aligns with findings from previous daily diary or ESM studies. Still,
it is important to acknowledge and address the potential role of the situational aspects of our
study as an alternative explanation for our findings.
First, the study’s setup among newly acquainted individuals may have restricted the
expression of certain narcissistic states. Specifically, the situational context of our study was
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 43
confined to online group sessions where participants progressively acquainted themselves
with each other. It can assumed that among those participants the emotional investment was
comparatively low (Edershile et al., 2023). The reduced emotional engagement might have
affected the manifestation of antagonism, potentially resulting in less frequent expressions of
combative behaviors, such as criticizing others (Kroencke et al., 2023).
Second, the limited situation selection may also have resulted in restricted narcissistic
state expressions. The Status Pursuit in Narcissism Model (i.e., SPIN model; Grapsas et al.,
2020) states that a pivotal aspect of attaining narcissistic goals is situation selection. In brief,
this model suggests that people with high narcissism scores tend to prefer public and
hierarchical environments and prioritize relationships that boost their status. In the current
study, selecting one’s situation was confined to the participants’ sign-up process. Although
the situations were tailored to afford narcissistic behaviors (e.g., by creating a social context
in which one can shine; Paulhus et al., 1998), the actual control over the situation itself was
limited.
Hierarchical Structural Composition of Narcissism: Trait and State Perspectives
To answer our third research question, we examined the hierarchical structure of
narcissism, considering its trait and state manifestations. In line with Whole Trait Theory
(Fleeson & Jayawickreme, 2015), we examined state- and trait-level structures using state
data. As mentioned above, based on theoretical frameworks, like the TESSERA model
(Wrzus & Roberts, 2017), correlations at the trait level might reflect co-manifestation in
situations. If this were true, we would expect a similar structural composition of narcissism at
the trait and state level.
Replicating Two- and Three-Domain Narcissism Structures
Initially, we examined the interconnections between the two higher-order (i.e.,
grandiosity and vulnerability) and the three lower-order domains separately. Our findings
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 44
showed moderate associations between grandiosity and vulnerability, evident at both trait and
state levels. This mostly aligns with previously reported associations (e.g., Crowe et al.,
2019; Edershile & Wright, 2021b). Within the TMN domains, we also replicated earlier
findings confirming our expectations (e.g., Crowe et al., 2019; Rogoza et al., 2024). Our
results highlight the central positioning of self-centered antagonism, which exhibited
moderately high associations with narcissistic neuroticism and agentic extraversion at both
trait and state levels. At the state level, the bivariate associations were very balanced. At the
trait level, self-centered antagonism displayed a stronger association with agentic
extraversion compared to narcissistic neuroticism, albeit with overlapping confidence
intervals. In summary, in line with the suggestions by Rogoza, Krammer, et al. (2024), our
findings support the applicability of the two- and three-domain structure in comprehending
narcissism at both trait and state levels.
Examining the Complete Hierarchical Narcissism Model
In the second step, we examined the hierarchical structural composition of narcissism.
Specifically, we explored how the three lower-order domains split off the two higher-order
domains. Our findings largely corroborated prior findings on trait narcissism (e.g., Crowe et
al., 2019). That is, in both the within- and between-person models, narcissistic neuroticism
reflected vulnerability, while agentic extraversion reflected grandiosity. However, the
emergence of self-centered antagonism appeared to be different than previously reported in
trait data (Crowe et al., 2019). Specifically, our findings indicate self-centered antagonism to
be more associated with grandiosity than vulnerability. Following, in our social group setting,
vulnerability appears to be primarily expressed through narcissistic neuroticism rather than
self-centered antagonism.
Although this latter finding does not align with our expectations based on the ideas
derived from the TESSERA framework (Wrzus & Roberts, 2017), prior research has
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 45
indicated that within multidimensional constructs, the loading patterns of lower-order
domains can vary across the trait and state levels. For example, research on the extraversion
dimension showed that while extraversion substantially loaded its sub-domain assertiveness
at the trait level (a = .62), this loading was considerably lower at the state level (a = .26;
Ringwald et al., 2022). This finding suggested differences in the manifestation of
extraversion at the state versus trait level. Specifically, while extraversion might be
manifested through assertiveness in general, not all situations seem to afford the expression
of extraversion through this domain.
A parallel argument can be made for narcissism. While trait data suggest that
vulnerability is generally expressed through both self-centered antagonism and narcissistic
neuroticism, our state data revealed that these manifestations may not always occur
simultaneously in the same situations. For instance, an individual with vulnerable tendencies
might express antagonism through combative behaviors (e.g., criticizing others) in one
context, and display neurotic traits through avoidant behaviors (e.g., being reserved) in
another (Kroencke et al., 2023). This dual expression of vulnerability may unfold across
various situations over time, but not necessarily concurrently.
Structural Composition of Narcissism: Affiliative vs. Controversial Settings
Despite our study not capturing a large variety of situational contexts, it offers a
unique opportunity to examine the structural composition of narcissism across two distinct
experimental conditions. Following, addressing our fourth research question, we expanded
our analysis beyond the overall structural composition of narcissism to investigate how the
narcissism structure manifests in affiliative versus controversial settings. This comparative
approach allowed us to examine narcissistic expression across varying social contexts.
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 46
At the between-person level, our models demonstrated consistent patterns across both
conditions, underscoring the robust overarching dispositional structure of narcissism.
However, some differences emerged at the within-person level.
In the initial, affiliative sessions, grandiosity and self-centered antagonism did not
show a significant relation. In other words, it seems that in our affiliative condition,
grandiosity was solely expressed through agentic extraversion and not through self-centered
antagonism. Although this finding contradicts our initial expectations and the overarching
structure we investigated earlier, it supports the ideas of the Dual-Pathway model (Back,
2018). Back (2018) suggests that grandiosity initially (in zero- and short-term acquaintances)
manifests as agentic extraversion, rather than antagonism, enhancing social popularity among
those with higher agency levels. This idea has received empirical support (e.g., Leckelt et al.,
2018).
In the more controversial settings, our findings showed that the three lower-order
domains—agentic extraversion, self-centered antagonism and narcissistic neuroticism—split
off from the two higher-order domains as expected. However, we could observe a slightly
negative association between grandiosity and vulnerability. This negative association
extended to the lower-order relation between narcissistic neuroticism and agentic
extraversion. We interpret this finding as follows: At the trait level vulnerability and
grandiosity share some overlapping features (i.e., antagonism). Moreover, in non-
controversial settings, individuals may balance grandiose and vulnerable manifestations
seamlessly. In contrast, controversial situations might force individuals to prioritize one set of
behaviors over another, resulting in the lack of co-occurrence between these domains. This
hypothesis revisits the ideas introduced in the preceding paragraph, suggesting that
individuals may not always be capable, nor would need to (i.e., to reach narcissistic goals)
experience all narcissistic domains simultaneously. Additionally, the later findings resemble
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 47
the results by Edershile et al. (2019), who reported a state-level association of r = .10
between vulnerability and grandiosity in ESM data. They noted that momentary grandiosity
is often linked to warmth and dominance, aiming to elevate status, while momentary
vulnerability is associated with coldness and negative affectivity, potentially leading to
withdrawal or conflict-avoidance behaviors.
Limitations and Directions for Future Research
Our study has several strengths, such as being preregistered, collecting data in a
standardized social setting, and combining multiple measurement instruments to assess
narcissism. However, we must also address certain limitations.
Primarily, some aspects may constrain the generalizability of the results. For instance,
we have a sample with a restricted age range, yet narcissism changes over the lifespan (e.g.,
Weidmann et al., 2022; Wetzel et al., 2020). Furthermore, despite the known gender
differences in narcissism (Grijalva et al., 2015; Weidmann et al., 2022), there was an
imbalance in gender representation, with a larger number of women compared to men.
Additionally, as emphasized multiple times, the findings need be interpreted in light of the
specific situational context. Following, there is the need for replications with a larger and
more balanced sample in terms of gender and age range, as well as across a wider range of
situational contexts.
Another limitation of this work is the potential imprecision in interpreting intraclass
correlations. ICCs weigh the proportion of within-person variance relative to between-person
variance, making them particularly sensitive to the composition of the sample. This sampling
effect could potentially obscure a clear understanding of the true stability of narcissism.
Importantly, our findings align with previous research showing less variability in narcissistc
examination of state variability across the narcissism spectrum. Consequently, the observed
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 48
ICCs do not appear artifacts of our specific sample composition but seem to reflect genuine
patterns of limited state variability across the narcissism continuum.
Finally, our study employs a “measurement stack” approach (Brunell & Buelow,
2018; Crowe et al., 2019; Miller, 2017; Schneider et al., 2023; Weiss et al., 2019) to capture
the full spectrum of narcissism, conceptualized as a dimensional construct without a
definitive clinical threshold. This approach integrates diverse strands of literature, advocating
for a unified perspective in the field. The inclusion of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory
(PNI) may be considered controversial by some. However, it is important to note that the PNI
has been validated for use in general populations, demonstrating stable factor structure and
high reliability (Pincus et al., 2009; Wright et al., 2010). From the Narcissism Spectrum
Model perspective, the PNI provides a comprehensive assessment of narcissistic
vulnerability, albeit with limited coverage of entitlement and grandiosity (Krizan & Herlache,
2018).
Laslty, we must acknowledge some limitations in our assessment approach. First, the
“measurement stack” method, while effective for capturing the triarchic structure of
narcissism, limits comparability with studies like Rogoza, Krammer, et al. (2024), which use
singular instruments to assess narcissism domains. Second, we adapted trait-level measures
for state-level assessments, which poses a challenge. Trait items are generally more abstract,
whereas state items tend to be more concrete. While the NGS (Crowe et al., 2016) and NVS
(Crowe et al., 2018) are validated state measures that capture this concreteness, not all of our
narcissism state items followed this approach. In contrast, the Big Five state-level items were
consistently more concrete. This discrepancy in the level of concreteness between the
narcissism and Big Five state assessments may have influenced our comparisons, with some
of the observed differences in state variability potentially stemming, at least in part, from
methodological artifacts.
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 49
To address this, future research should focus on measuring narcissistic states more
concretely. Specifically, given that current state assessments often emphasize emotional
states (e.g., NVS and NGS), we recommend broadening the scope of future assessments to
include interpersonal dynamics, such as momentary perceptions of status or relationships, as
well as cognitive elements (Wilt & Revelle, 2015), such as real-time self-perceptions and
thought patterns. This approach would offer a more balanced and comprehensive
understanding of narcissistic states.
Conclusion
This study investigated narcissistic states, conceptualized as a hierarchical three-
domain construct. Our findings reveal substantial and meaningful variations in narcissistic
domain states within a standardized longitudinal online group setting, largely replicating
patterns observed in daily diary and ESM research. These variabilities confirm that
narcissism can vary over time and across similar situations, albeit more subtly compared to
other personality states, suggesting a more goal-focused nature of narcissism. Our data
indicates that trait narcissism sets an upper boundary for state expressions, with momentary
manifestations typically deviating below this level. Regarding narcissism structure, we
successfully replicated previously established relations among higher-order domains
(grandiosity and vulnerability) and lower-order domains (agentic extraversion, self-centered
antagonism, and narcissistic neuroticism) using state-level data. However, at least in the
context of our study, we observed a nuanced hierarchical structure. Notably, vulnerability
predominantly loaded onto narcissistic neuroticism rather than self-centered antagonism in
the social context of our study. Additionally, the structural composition of narcissistic states
differed depending on the experimental condition.
In conclusion, this study provides a foundational framework for understanding the
hierarchical structure of narcissism in state-level expressions. Our findings reveal an intricate
RELATIONS AMONG THE TRIFURCATED NARCISSISTIC DOMAINS 50
interplay between trait-level tendencies and situational factors in shaping narcissistic
behaviors. Narcissistic domains show lower variability compared to the Big Five, suggesting
a stronger influence of the corresponding trait-level domain compared to the situation.
However, the structural composition of narcissism at the state level—characterized by
momentary relations between narcissism domains—demonstrates heightened susceptibility to
contextual influences. Specifically, these inter-domain relations exhibit distinct patterns
across varied situational contexts, underscoring the dynamic nature of narcissistic states.
