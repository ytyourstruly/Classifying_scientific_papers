Abstract
Empirical evidence is lacking on the effectiveness of grief telephone counselling,
particularly in Australia. This study addresses an important gap by evaluating the
effectiveness of the Integrating Grief Program – Victoria (IGP-V), an Australian telephone-
based intervention. A retrospective analysis of IGP-V session data was analysed with 197
former clients, examining change in psychological distress (Kessler 10; K10) across pre- and
post-treatment time points. Psychological distress significantly decreased at a group and
individual level; 48% of the participants showed a reliable reduction in their symptoms (n=
95) while 31.4% showed a change that was both reliable and clinically significant (n= 62).
Further analyses examined K10 subscales: Anxiety (comprising ‘nervous’, ‘agitated’) and
Depression (comprising ‘fatigue’, ‘negative affect’). Depression was significantly more
prominent in the sample than Anxiety, and both Anxiety and Depression decreased over time,
with a stronger reduction in depression. Of the depression subscales, fatigue was the most
prominent pre- and post-treatment, while negative affect reduced the most post-treatment. A
Latent Class Analysis (LCA) identified three subgroups (low, medium, and high distress)
based on K10 subscales. The medium distress group demonstrated the greatest treatment
responsiveness, with 41% (n = 41) showing reliable and clinically significant change. With
few studies exploring the effectiveness of grief counselling in Australian populations, this
research provides important preliminary evidence of IGP-V’s potential to reduce grief related
psychological distress. These findings are a vital first step toward improving grief support
and mental health services in Australia, with further studies set to expand on this promising
preliminary data.

Introduction
Introduction
Grief, a universal human experience, encompasses a range of emotional, cognitive,
physiological, behavioural, spiritual, social, and familial impacts (Jones-Eversley & Rice,
2022; Johannsen et al., 2019). While grief can arise from significant life events, such as job
loss, relationship breakdown, or a major health diagnosis, it is strongly associated with the
death of a loved one (bereavement) (Jann et al., 2024). Bereavement significantly impacts
individual and public health, with an estimated six to ten individuals considerably affected for
every death, particularly following unexpected or traumatic losses (Johannsen et al., 2019;
Zuelke et al., 2021).
While most individuals navigate grief with the support of family, friends, and
informal networks, the potential for significant mental and physical health consequences,
including increased mortality risk, underscores grief as a major public health concern (Seiler
et al., 2020). For individuals with limited social support, community bereavement programs
play a crucial role in providing access to essential services. These programs typically offer a
range of support, including individual and group counselling, emotional and social support,
information dissemination, and opportunities for social interaction among mourners (Maass
et al., 2022; Worden, 2018).
Little has been reported on the effectiveness of community counselling programs, and
even less on telephone counselling services. To date, no data exists on telephone grief
counselling services in Australia. Further, for grief counselling services in general, little is
known about factors which contribute to its effectiveness, such as different manifestations of
grief or certain risk factors.
Variations in grief experience and risk factors
Grief affects us on a cognitive, physiological, affective and behavioural level,
including through experiences such as emotional pain, preoccupation with the deceased,
yearning, social withdrawal, and even deterioration in physical health (Aoun et al., 2020;
Reime et al., 2024). While psychological experiences like this are a common part of grief
experience, the degree and nature of suffering experienced can vary widely. A recent
Australian study revealed that 26% of bereaved individuals experienced deteriorating
physical health, and 27% reported declining mental health (Aoun et al., 2020). Where grief is
complex or traumatic there is a high rate of co-occurrence of other mental health conditions
such as major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD;
Nakajima et al., 2012). Where the presentation warrants a diagnosis of prolonged grief
disorder, a person is likely to experience more pervasive or severe symptoms including
identity disruption, reminder avoidance, emotional numbness, and a sense of
meaninglessness. Somatic symptoms such as headaches and digestive issues often
accompany grief, particularly when emotional suppression occurs (O'Connor, 2019). Grief is
also linked to an increased risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease.
Factors influencing grief responses encompass personal, circumstantial, social,
cultural, and biological/psychological dimensions. A person’s grief will be experienced
differently depending on personal characteristics such as age (Schladitz et al, 2021),
personality traits (e.g., neuroticism, resilience; Peak et al., 2024), coping factors (Peak et al.,
2024), gender (Lundorff et al., 2020; Pop-Jordanova, 2021), pre-existing mental health
conditions (Rheingold et al., 2024), and attachment style (Eisma et al., 2023). For example,
the rate of depression increases as a person ages (Schladitz et al., 2021), using denial or
substance use as coping strategies predict symptoms of grief or health difficulties (Peak et al.,
2024), and being female is linked to a high probability of developing prolonged grief disorder
(Pop-Jordanova, 2021). Circumstances surrounding the loss include the type of loss e.g.,
sudden or unexpected (Szuhany, et al., 2021), the nature of the death e.g., traumatic or violent
(Jann et al., 2024), and the relationship with the deceased (Selman et al.,2022). Social and
cultural factors include the availability of social support, family dynamics, cultural norms
surrounding grief, religious beliefs, and socioeconomic status (Roberts et al., 2012;
Aeschlimann et al., 2024). Psychological and biological vulnerabilities include a history of
trauma (Jann et al., 2024), negative thought patterns (Komischke-Konnerup et al., 2023), and
neuroendocrine alterations (Hopf et al., 2020).
Implications for public health networks
Although grief itself is not a disease, bereavement is associated with morbidity and
higher mortality (O’Connor, 2019; Seiler et al., 2020; Stroebe et al., 2007). Unaddressed,
repressed, or maladaptive responses to grief are thought to instigate new health risks or
worsen existing physical and mental health issues (Jones-Eversley & Rice, 2022). Mortality
(including suicide), while rare, is more likely where an individual has chronic diseases,
depression, or complicated or traumatic grief, (Jones-Eversley & Rice, 2022 Stroebe et al.,
2007). Mortality in widowed populations is highest in the earliest months following death of
their spouse and decreases as bereavement time increases (Ennis & Majid, 2020). The
"widowhood effect" describes the heightened mortality risk within six months of
bereavement, especially among spouses (Rees and Lutkins, 1967; O'Connor, 2019; van
Boekel et al., 2021). A study by Aoun et al. (2020) reported that the overall physical and
mental health of Australian individuals deteriorated by 21.5% after they experienced a
bereavement, thus, placing a higher strain on public health networks (Lichtenthal et al, 2024).
Protective factors and the role of community bereavement programs
Adaptive coping with grief is influenced by various factors, including cultural beliefs
about mourning, family dynamics, and individual personality traits (Peña-Vargas et al.,
2021). Intrapersonal factors such as optimism, self-esteem, and attachment style, along with
religious beliefs and meaning systems, can significantly impact grief experiences (Stroebe et
al., 2007). Interpersonal factors, including social support, economic resources, and access to
professional intervention, also play crucial roles (Stroebe et al., 2007). Furthermore, an
individual's evolving understanding of death and grief throughout their lifespan shapes their
bereavement experience (Peña-Vargas et al., 2021).
Social support emerges as a critical factor in mitigating the impact of grief. Research
consistently demonstrates a strong association between social support and positive
psychosocial outcomes following bereavement (Aoun et al., 2020). While the availability of
social support diminishes over time, it remains vital for effective grief coping (Breen &
O’Connor, 2011; Worden, 2018). The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted access to
social support, increasing the risk of prolonged grief disorder due to restrictions on funeral
attendance and social gatherings (Carr et al., 2020; Mortazavi et al., 2020). While most
individuals rely on informal support from family and friends (Aoun et al., 2020), and formal
support services such as professional bereavement counselling and community support
groups are utilised by a smaller proportion of individuals, they can be crucial for those with
limited social support networks (Breen & O’Connor, 2011; Mortazavi et al., 2020; Worden,
2018). The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the delivery of community
bereavement services, necessitating a rapid transition from in-person to remote service
delivery models, including telehealth and telephone counselling (Murphy et al., 2021).
Fundamental elements of grief counselling
Grief counselling involves a multidimensional approach that integrates evidence-
based practices to support individuals navigating the complexities of loss. Central to this
process is the emphasis on fostering adaptive coping strategies, as outlined by Stroebe and
Schut (2008) in their Dual Process Model of coping with bereavement. This framework
emphasises the dynamic interplay between loss-oriented and restoration-oriented coping,
encouraging individuals to oscillate between confronting the emotional pain of their loss and
engaging in activities that promote restoration and continuity in daily life. This adaptive
approach not only validates the individual’s grief experience but also equips them with the
tools necessary to rebuild and adapt to life in the aftermath of loss (Larsen et al., 2024).
Additionally, the application of person-centred principles is a cornerstone of grief
counselling (Murray, 2023). Rooted in the seminal works of Rogers (1992, 2011) and later
expanded by Murphy and Sparks (2018), this approach prioritises the unique experiences and
intrinsic worth of each client. By fostering a therapeutic environment characterised by
empathy, congruence, and unconditional positive regard, counsellors can create a safe space
where clients feel understood and empowered. This client-centred ethos respects the
individuality of the grieving process and accommodates the diverse ways in which people
experience and express their grief (Murray, 2023).
Finally, a third central aspect of grief counselling is the facilitation of the expression
and exploration of emotional pain and the subsequent search for meaning, processes which
are integral to healing. Negri et al. (2023) highlight the therapeutic value of providing clients
with opportunities to articulate and examine their emotional experiences in a supportive
context. Similarly, Neimeyer (2019) emphasises the importance of meaning-making in the
grieving process, wherein individuals reconstruct a coherent narrative of their loss. By
helping clients explore existential questions and integrate their loss into a broader life
context, counsellors can support their journey toward acceptance and personal growth
(Murray, 2023).
In summary, grief counselling is a nuanced and compassionate practice that combines
adaptive coping strategies, person-centred principles, and the facilitation of emotional
exploration and meaning making. Together, these elements empower individuals to navigate
the profound challenges of grief and ultimately foster resilience and renewal.
Measuring Effectiveness of Community Bereavement Programs
Literature on the effectiveness of community bereavement programs presents mixed
results. A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis by Johannsen et al. reviewed 31
randomised control trial studies on psychological interventions for grief. The studies varied
in design, including one, two or three-armed studies. The interventions delivered included (a)
individual grief, psychoeducation, interpersonal, exposure (in person and internet), narrative,
cognitive behavioural (internet and in person) or complicated grief therapy, (b) social,
interpretive, family specific or bereavement support groups, (c) self-help, or (d) expressive
writing. The studies utilised many grief measurement scales, most commonly Inventory of
Complicated Grief-Revised (ICG-R; Prigerson et al., 1995) or Prolonged Grief – 13 (PG-13)
Item scale (Prigerson et al., 2009). Overall, a small effect size was found for reducing grief
symptoms both post intervention (Hedges's g = 0.41, p < .001, K = 31) and at follow up (g =
0.45, p < .001, K = 18). Larger effect sizes were found (a) if the intervention was individually
delivered (β= 0.49, p < .001), (b) if the study used the Inventory of Complicated Grief -
(Revised)/Prolonged Grief -13 questionnaires as the grief instrument (β = 0.46, p < .001), (c)
if the participants were greater than 6 months post-loss (β = 0.58, p < .001), (d) if the
participants had higher baseline symptom levels (β = 0.40, p = .002 and (e) if the quality of
the study was higher (β = 0.06, p = .013). There is preliminary empirical evidence supporting
the effectiveness of telephone counselling in providing grief support (d = 0.33; Newsom et al,
2017) demonstrating its comparability to face-to-face services (Hargrave et al., 2008;
Meichsner et al., 2015).
Evaluating the effectiveness of mental health interventions for grief presents unique
challenges. Not only is grief an individual experience which can present differently from
person to person, but recovery exists on a continuum, so individual change can occur at
different points along that continuum. This contrasts with research with clearly defined
outcomes (e.g., walking ability versus paralysis). Moreover, designs involving group
contrasts, whether they be one-armed or two-armed (controlled) designs, have mixed
advantages and disadvantages (Azher, 2023; Wang et al., 2024;): two-armed trials are more
methodologically rigorous, but normally require narrowly defined mental health (no co-
occurring conditions). In this way, they can create a laboratory setting which is different to
the reality of how a service is normally offered, and they may not always be practical to
implement. Both kinds of design, if focussing solely on group differences, may not fully
capture individual-level improvements (Evans et al., 1998).
To better capture individual-level change in single-group designs, Jacobson et al.
(1984) introduced the concept of Reliable and Clinically Significant Change (RCSC). This
approach assesses individual-level changes in the context of both sample-wide variability,
and previously established norms. This ensures confidence that observed changes are not
merely attributable to measurement error (Jacobson et al., 1984) and allows the outcomes of
change to be compared to clinical norms. While applicable to various clinical issues, RCSC
has been predominantly employed in psychotherapy research (Evans et al., 1998).
Reliable change evaluates whether an individual's change is substantial enough to
confidently attribute it to factors beyond measurement error. The Reliable Change (RC)
Index, which assesses an individual’s change over time while considering error variability,
utilizes a modified standard error of measurement (SE ), termed the SE of the difference
(SE ). The formula for the SE of measurement of a difference, where SD is the standard
diff 1
deviation of the baseline observations and r is the reliability of the measure, is:
SE = SD √2√1 − 𝑟
diff 1
In addition to reliable change, the clinical significance of post-treatment changes is
considered. Jacobson et al. (1984) defined clinically significant change as a transition from
the "dysfunctional" to the "functional" population range. This criterion involves one of three
deviations (SDs) from the original mean, without explicit comparison to a normative
"normal" population, (b) a post-treatment score that places the patient within two SDs of a
normative sample mean, neglecting the patient's movement out of the original sample and, (c)
a higher likelihood of the patient belonging to the normative distribution rather than the
clinical distribution after treatment. This involves determining a "cut-off" point where the
probability of belonging to each distribution is equal. When the standard deviations of the
clinical and normative data are equal, this cut-off point is the mean of the first two criteria as
shown in this formula:
mean SD + mean SD
clin norm norm clin

Integrating Grief Program - Victoria
The Integrating Grief Program – Victoria (IGP-V) is a collaborative initiative between
Victoria Police and the non-profit organisation Griefline, providing bereavement counselling
to community members affected by police-involved deaths, particularly unexpected or
unnatural deaths. Funded by the Southeast Melbourne Public Health Network (SEMPHN),
the program offers six telehealth counselling sessions with a Griefline counsellor upon
referral by Victoria Police officers. Since its inception in 2014, IGP-V has received over
10,000 referrals, primarily for medical/natural or accidental bereavements. Cases involving
homicide, suicide, or motor vehicle accidents are typically referred to alternative specialised
services. Griefline may occasionally serve as a secondary referral source for these services.
Counsellors participating in the IGP-V program receive training on the program's
specific counselling model, which encourages the integration of effective bereavement
treatment principles. These principles include the effective treatment principles of fostering
adaptive coping mechanisms (Stroebe & Schut, 2008), applying person-centred principles
(Murphy and Sparks, 2018; Rodgers, 1992; Rodgers, 2011), and facilitating the expression
and exploration of emotional pain and the search for meaning (Negri et al., 2023; Neimeyer,
2019).
Current Study
This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the IGP-V community
bereavement support program, which, despite receiving positive informal feedback from
participants, lacks empirical evidence regarding its efficacy. Given the important role the
service plays in receiving referrals for people affected by police-involved deaths, as well as
the reliance of some individuals solely on such community-based support, this research is
necessary.
The study employed a retrospective design to analyse pre- and post-treatment
psychological distress measures. The primary objective was to determine whether the six
grief counselling sessions offered through IGP-V effectively reduced psychological distress
at both the group and individual levels. A significant reduction in distress was hypothesised
(Hypothesis 1). Further to this group-level change, on an individual level, it was hypothesised
that a considerable proportion of clients would show reliable and clinically significant change
(RCSC) (Hypothesis 2), comparable to other studies which have assessed RCSC for the K10
in clinical populations (approximately 20-30%; Gonda et al., 2012, Kwan et al., 2018;
Rickwood et al., 2015).
Furthermore, the study aimed to investigate the influence of variables identified in
previous research as impacting grief outcomes (Bonanno & Kaltman, 2001; Currier et al.,
2008; Johannsen et al., 2019; Newsom et al., 2017; Stroebe et al., 2001). It was hypothesised
that risk factors would hinder a reduction in psychological distress and protective factors
would facilitate a reduction in psychological distress (Hypothesis 3). Thus, we hypothesised
that psychological distress would be significantly reduced if the participant was younger and
female (Stroebe & Schut, 2001), the deceased was older and male (Stroebe & Schut, 2001)
and relational attachment was less (Bonanno & Kaltman, 2001), the service duration was
greater (Currier et al., 2007), and the death was expected (e.g. due to the presence of a known
illness; Currier et al., 2006; 2008).
Method
Subjects
This retrospective study included 197 former participants in the IGPV program
between January 2021 and February 2023, who were largely female (n = 147, the others
male) aged between 18 and 78 years (Median = 49 years; IQR = 26) anonymously drawn
from Griefline’s database of participants in the IGP-V. A power analysis (based on power =
0.95, effect size = 0.25 and α = 0.25) showed that a sample of at least 132 was needed for a
2x2 ANOVA (time: pre vs. post, and measure: anxiety, depression), and less for an
independent samples t-test (main effect of the treatment over time) and a one-way repeated
measures ANOVA (examining the effect of categorical variables on distress reduction. Those
who met the inclusion criteria were adult Australian residents who had experienced
bereavement following a referral from Victoria Police (excluding homicides, suicides, and
motor-vehicle-related deaths). They were required to participate in the six-session IGP-V
program and complete pre- and post-treatment psychological distress assessments actively
and voluntarily. Ethics approval exemption was granted by the Cairnmillar Institute Human
Research Ethics Committee (number 2022111601E) due to the use of deidentified historical
data.
Materials and Measures
This study utilised the Kessler-10 scale (K10; Kessler & Mroczek, 1992) to assess
grief-related psychological distress. The K10, a 10-item self-report measure with a five-point
Likert scale, assesses psychological distress focussing on anxiety and depression. While the
K10 possesses acceptable psychometric properties (Cronbach's α = 0.93; Kessler et al., 2003),
its use was also mandated by Southeast Melbourne Public Health Network (SEMPHN)
funding requirements. In the present study its Cronbach’s α was .89 and 0.90 at pre- and post-
treatment time points respectively. For the purposes of the current study, the subscales of
depression (6 items) and anxiety (4 items) were used, as has been done in previous studies
(Brooks et al., 2006). The scores for these subscales were calculated by summing the relevant
items, and for anxiety scores were multiplied by 1.5 to make the ranges of the anxiety and
depression subscales even, for the purposes of scale comparison. These subscales showed
good reliability in the present study (α = 0.80 and 0.86 respectively for anxiety and
depression at baseline). To enable more specific symptomatology to be examined, further
subscales were calculated, consistent with previous research (Brooks et al., 2006), examining
nervousness and agitation (two items each, part of the anxiety subscale) and fatigue and
negative affect (two items and four items respectively, part of the depression subscale).
Scores for these subscales were calculated by summing the relevant items and multiplying all
scores except for ‘negative affect’ by two, to make the ranges of all four subscales even, for
the purposes of scale comparison. These four subscales showed acceptable reliability in the
current study (0.78, 0.82, 0.63, 0.85 respectively at baseline). While the Cronbach α for
‘fatigue’ was low at 0.63, it was decided to retain this subscale for exploratory analysis, as
this value is likely lower due to having only two items and as it likely reflects the presence of
different kinds of fatigue while still carrying important information on symptoms.
In addition to the K10, demographic information of both the participant and the
deceased was collated from the intake and referral, comprising age, gender, months since
death, service duration (days), relationship to the deceased (binary variable entered as either a
relative or non-relative), age and gender of the deceased, and expectedness of death (binary
variable, assessed based on whether the cause of death was described as health or non-health
related or not applicable if information was not stated in the intake/referral information).
Procedure and data analysis
Data was extracted from the SEMPHN database (Redicase) and de-identified by a
member of Griefline before being provided to the research team for analysis. Data was then
cleaned, formatted appropriately for analysis, and imported into the Jamovi 2.4.11 statistical
software package. No missing values were identified. The pre- and post-scores for the K10
scale showed significant deviations from normality, as indicated by the Shapiro-Wilk test.
Additionally, the K10 baseline scores exhibited slight positive skewness and platykurtic
distribution, while the K10 post-scores were positively skewed with a mesokurtic
distribution. Given this non-normal distribution, non-parametric analyses were employed to
test the relevant hypotheses (see below).
To assess reliable and clinically significant change (RCSC) for the K10, reliable
change indices were calculated based on an alpha level of 0.05 and a reliability coefficient of
0.93 taken from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA), a US-based
nationally representative survey including about 45000 adults (Kessler et al., 2003).
Clinically significant change indices were based on Criterion C as described above, i.e. being
more likely to belong to a normative population than to the clinical population. The
normative data for the K10 were taken from the 2007 Australian National Survey of Mental
Health and Wellbeing, a nationally representative household survey of 8841 adults conducted
by the Australian Bureau of Statistics as reported by Slade et al. (2011), including K10 data.
A K10 standard deviation (SD) for the entire sample was not reported, only a standard error
(SE), so it was estimated using the formula SD = SE √𝑛, resulting in SD = 0.1 √8839 = 9.40
(Altman & Bland, 2005). The overall sample from Slade et al. (2011) was taken as the
normative sample (M=14.5, and SD = 9.40), and the current sample’s baseline K10 mean was
taken as the clinical sample (M=28.2, and SD = 7.91). Using these reference groups, the
clinical significance variable would reflect whether a person who completed treatment is
more likely to belong to the treatment-seeking baseline sample or to the general Australian
population.
Considering the non-normality of the data, to assess the reduction in distress over time
at a group-level (hypothesis 1), a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was employed. To examine the
percentage of clients showing RCSC (hypothesis 2), the above-described calculations were
performed for each individual, and frequencies were calculated for those who met and did not
meet the cutoff values for reliable change and clinical significance. To assess associations
between continuous variables (e.g., participant age, deceased age, service duration) and the
K10, Spearman rank correlations were calculated, and to assess the association between
categorical variables and the K10, Kruskall-Wallis tests were conducted (both relate to
hypothesis 3). For further exploratory analysis, assessing change over time for K10 subscales,
Friedman's test was performed as a non-parametric equivalent to the repeated measures
ANOVA. Additionally, a latent class analysis, appropriate for non-normally distributed data,
was used to explore grouping of clients based on their K10 profiles.
Results
Regarding reduction in distress at a group level (hypothesis 1), a Wilcoxon signed
rank test showed there was a significant reduction (W = 18177, p < .001) in psychological
distress post intervention compared to preintervention with a 7 point reduction in median K10
scores (Median = 20, IQR = 10 vs Median = 27, IQR = 11), resulting in a large
post post pre pre
effect size, with a rank-biserial correlation of r = 0.92.
At an individual level (hypothesis 2), (i) approximately half of participants showed a
reliable reduction in their symptoms (n = 95, 48%), (ii) just over half showed clinically
significant reduction in their symptoms (n = 111, 56.3%) and (iii) approximately one third
showed a reliable and clinically significant reduction in their symptoms (n = 62, 31.5%).
As to the influence of potential predictor variables on the reduction in psychological
distress (hypothesis 3), no significant relationships were found between pre-post K10 score
differences and any continuous variable (age, age of the deceased, service duration), or any
categorical variable (gender, deceased gender, relationship to the deceased, expectedness of
death, and presence of a known illness).
In a further exploratory analysis examining changes in K10 subscales anxiety and
depression, Friedman's test for repeated measures revealed a significant main effect of time
on levels of anxiety and depression (χ²(3) = 239, p < .001). Pairwise comparisons (Durbin-
Conover) revealed that both anxiety and depression levels significantly decreased from pre-
to post-treatment, with depression levels significantly higher than anxiety at baseline
(Median = 17; Median = 15; T = 29.6, p < .00001) but not at post-treatment
depression anxiety
(Median = 13; Median = 12; T = 27.0, p < .00001). The reduction in depression
depression anxiety
was slightly more pronounced than the reduction in anxiety, as evidenced by the larger
differences in median scores (three for anxiety and four for depression).
A finer grained exploratory analysis examining changes in the subscales nervousness,
agitation (part of the anxiety subscale), and fatigue and negative affect (part of depression)
was then conducted. Friedman's test for repeated measures revealed a significant main effect
of time on levels of nervousness, agitation, fatigue, and negative affect (χ²(7) = 422, p <
.001). Pairwise comparisons showed significant reductions in all subscales from pre- to post-
treatment, with fatigue levels being significantly higher than the other subscales at both time
points. The largest drop was for negative affect (Median scores dropping 3 points from 11 to
8), while all of the other subscales dropped 2 points (Median scores for fatigue dropping from
To explore whether certain groups of clients responded better to treatment than others,
a Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was conducted to identify distinct subgroups within a sample
based on four subscales of the K10: nervousness, agitation, fatigue, and negative affect. The
number of clusters was chosen by comparing models with varying numbers of classes, and
comparing fit statistics, especially the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC), and entropy. A 3-class model was selected as it provided a
balance between model fit and class separation, with an AIC of 3398, BIC of 3858, and
entropy of 0.884. Class 1 (23.3% of the sample) was characterised by low levels of
nervousness, agitation, fatigue, and negative affect, with especially notably low levels of
nervousness; Class 2 (49.8% of the sample) was characterised by moderate levels of these
symptoms, while those in Class 3 (26.9% of the sample) showed high levels of symptoms,
with a notable probability of experiencing high fatigue. Median values for each subscale
The medium distress class showed most responsiveness, with 41% (n = 41) of cases
showing reliable and clinically significant change, followed by low distress (24%, n=11) then
high distress (20%, n=10). These differences were significant in a 3x2 chi square test (χ²=
8.76, p<0.05).
Discussion
This retrospective study investigated the effectiveness of the IGP-V community
bereavement support program using historical deidentified data. The first hypothesis,
predicting a reduction in psychological distress following the six-session IGP-V intervention,
was fully supported at both the group and individual levels, with approximately one-third of
participants demonstrating both reliable and clinically significant symptom improvement.
Significant reductions were observed in both anxiety and depression subscales, with a more
pronounced effect on depression. Furthermore, significant reductions were observed in
subscale subcomponents, particularly negative affect. Cluster analysis identified three distinct
groups of help-seekers (low, medium, and high distress), with the medium distress group
exhibiting the highest number of people showing RCSC. The third hypothesis, which posited
that variables identified in previous studies (e.g., relationship to the deceased, time since
death) would influence psychological distress and intervention efficacy, was not supported.
These findings will be discussed in relation to the broader literature on community
bereavement support programs, followed by an examination of methodological
considerations, and concluding with a discussion of the study's implications.
Effectiveness of Integrating Grief Program-Victoria in Reducing Distress Levels
The strong support for the first hypothesis, a significant reduction in psychological
distress at both group and individual levels following the IGP-V intervention, aligns with
existing literature on the benefits of grief counselling and community support programs
(Aoun et al., 2020; Worden, 2018). The observed effect size (rank-biserial correlation of r =
.92) was very strong and appears considerably stronger than the typical effect size reported
for grief therapy interventions (Johannsen et al., 2019; g = 0.41, considered moderate). This
is comparable to very strong effect sizes reported in one study (Rosner et al., 2014; d = 1.61),
involving a substantially larger number of sessions (20–25 sessions, compared to 6 sessions
in the present study). This shorter duration may reflect a more time-efficient approach while
still achieving substantial reductions in psychological distress. Further to these pre-post
comparisons, the study employed the concept of reliable and clinically significant change,
highlighting the meaningful impact of the intervention on each individual. Nearly half of the
participants demonstrated a reliable reduction in symptoms, with over half achieving
clinically significant improvement, comparable to outcomes observed in inpatient and
community settings for severe mental illness (Gonda et al., 2012; Kwan et al., 2018;
Rickwood et al., 2015).
That fact that people who started treatment with moderate levels of distress showed
the most improvement is likely due to a combination of ceiling effect of the reliable change
variable, and a floor effect of the clinically significant change variable. In other words, it is
harder for a person who is already showing lower baseline distress to reduce it as much as a
person who started high, and it is harder for a person who is very distressed at baseline to
improve enough to reach clinical significance. This was evident in the data as the people
whose distress baseline already met the cutoff for the normative sample (n= 42, or 21.4%)
also showed considerably lower levels of change (U=1733, p < .001). The benefits of
treatment for this “healthy” baseline group may have been harder to quantify solely using the
K10 and may have been better assessed using an instrument tapping into grief-specific
symptoms, such as the Grief Response Scale (Payás-Puigarnau et al., 2024). The people who
showed reliable change but did not meet the cutoff for the normative sample post-treatment
(n= 33, or 16.8%) may have benefitted from a longer course of treatment (Helmich, 2024).
Alternatively, these individuals may include bereaved people who have existing mental
health problems for whom reaching a level of freedom from distress equivalent to the
normative sample following only grief counselling may be unrealistic. These findings
underscore the importance of individualised support in grief counselling, aligning with the
criticism of a one-size-fits-all approach (Johannsen et al., 2019).
Further explorative analysis of K10 subscales revealed a reduction in both the anxiety
and depression subscales of the K10, with greater effect on the depression component,
consistent with the known association between prolonged grief and depression (Komischke-
Konnerup et al., 2021). Interestingly, of the two depression subscales, it was fatigue which
showed the highest baseline, while it was negative affect which showed the strongest
reduction. This negative affect subscale contains items on hopelessness, sadness, ‘feeling
depressed’ and worthlessness. It would seem understandable that these negative affective
components would be most likely to be reduced by grief counselling as there is a large
overlap with symptoms of grief (Szuhany et al., 2021; Zisook & Shear, 2009), and these are
often focussed on in grief counselling (Eisma et al., 2022; Markowitz & Milrod, 2011). It
seems interesting that fatigue, while diminishing after treatment, also had the highest baseline
and highest post treatment level of all of the four K10 subscales. Fatigue symptoms are likely
related to underlying psychophysiological processes and are found in both depression
(Behrens et al., 2022; Eggart et al., 2023; Seiler et al., 2020) and grief (Seiler et al., 2020). In
the context of grief, fatigue can be related to the emotional burden of the loss itself, as well as
to the life adjustments that are needed (Seiler et al., 2020; Worden, 2018) or the
administrative burden, such as arranging funerals and probate applications (Boerner &
Schulz, 2010; Stroebe & Schut, 1999). The fact that that fatigue seemed to the most strongly
present symptom in this sample, and that it remained the clearly strongest symptom after
treatment, could suggest the need for targeted interventions such as behavioural activation for
individuals.
Variables that Affect Psychological Distress
Contrary to the first hypothesis, no significant relationships were found between grief-
related risk- and protective factors (e.g., relationship to the deceased, time since death) and
the reduction in psychological distress. We expected that risk factors would hinder a
reduction in distress and protective factors would do the opposite, due to fewer or
respectively more therapeutic resources being available. This unexpected finding contradicts
prior literature, which identified various risk and protective factors influencing bereavement
outcomes (Stroebe et al., 2007; Peña-Vargas et al., 2021). Notably, the lack of significant
associations with relationship to the deceased and expectedness of death is surprising, given
the established role of attachment theory in bereavement coping (Eisma et al., 2023; LeRoy et
al., 2019) and the recognised impact of violent or sudden deaths on mental health (Scott et al.,
2020). Several explanations for these findings are possible. The absence of significant
relationships may indicate that IGP-V's effectiveness is relatively consistent across diverse
bereaved populations, suggesting a broad applicability of the program. However, these
variables were also not related to baseline levels of distress, suggesting another explanation,
possibly, that certain specific characteristics of the present sample may have attenuated the
influence of these variables. For example, this sample arguably contains people who have
reached a threshold of suffering sufficient to compel them to take part in a grief counselling
program, while others who did not reach this threshold may not have chosen to take part in
the program. Furthermore, two of the important variables used in the present study were
binary (e.g. expectedness (yes/no), relationship with the deceased (relative / non-relative),
which limited their informativeness. Future research should address these limitations and
explore the potential moderating effects of individual differences on IGP-V's efficacy.
Strengths and Limitations
This study is the first of its kind to investigate the efficacy of a community-based
telephone bereavement counselling program within an Australian context. Its significance lies
in its directly addressing a practical concern and its potential to inform the development of
more effective grief support and mental health policies. The study incorporates a relatively
large and diverse sample and focusses not just on pre-post group-level differences, but also
on individual change trajectories. The inclusion of the individual-level RCSC variable
strengthens the analytical rigor by ensuring the observed changes in psychological distress
are of meaningful magnitude and possess clinical significance with respect to well established
norms of the highly researched K10 scale. Furthermore, additional exploratory analyses add
to our understanding of the observed changes, examining separate components of
psychological distress using K10 subscales, and examining latent classes of participants
within the sample. Both of these aspects have the potential to contribute to the development
of more nuanced and individualised bereavement interventions. The study's findings give
good preliminary support for the program’s effectiveness. However, further research,
including a larger-scale study incorporating a waitlist control group, is warranted to refine the
program and further solidify its effectiveness across diverse contexts.
This study also exhibits several limitations. The reliance on Victoria Police referrals
may introduce sampling bias, as this source may predominantly represent specific
bereavement circumstances, thereby limiting the generalisability of the findings to a broader
range of bereaved individuals. The exclusion of certain bereavement types, such as homicides
and suicides, further restricts the study's generalisability. Further, the absence of a control
group hinders the establishment of a causal relationship between the intervention and
observed outcomes, as the influence of confounding factors, such as the natural course of
grief, or other intervening factors, cannot be definitively ruled out. The potential for self-
selection bias, where participants actively seeking help may differ significantly from those
who decline participation, may lead to an overestimation of the intervention's true impact.
Moreover, the study's focus on immediate pre- and post-treatment periods limits the
assessment of long-term treatment effects and the sustainability of observed outcomes. While
the K10 scale is a widely used measure, it is not specialised for grief symptoms. The
utilisation of multiple assessment tools could provide a more comprehensive understanding
of the multifaceted nature of grief-related distress. Finally, the potential impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on community bereavement programs should be acknowledged and
considered within the broader context of the study's findings.
Implications/Future Research
This study holds diverse implications for bereaved individuals, mental health
professionals, policymakers, and community support organisations. The findings provide
good preliminary support the efficacy of the IGP-V program in reducing psychological
distress through telehealth bereavement counselling, particularly for individuals experiencing
grief related to police involvement. This underscores the significance of accessible and
tailored community-based interventions. The study further supports the effectiveness of
telehealth services in grief counselling, emphasizing its viability as an alternative to in-person
sessions.
To further clarify the mechanisms of change, future research should involve direct
data collection to explore the grief counselling process, including modalities used, key
themes discussed, and perceived impact on participants' distress levels. A randomised
controlled trial design would strengthen causal inference. Qualitative research methods could
also be incorporated to gain in-depth insights into participants' experiences. Furthermore, the
use of additional measurement scales could provide a more comprehensive understanding of
grief-related distress.
