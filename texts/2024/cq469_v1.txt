Abstract
Previous research has shown that even derogatory terms like "slut" can be re-appropriated to
produce positive outcomes. This study replicates and extends Gaucher et al. (2015) by examining
Black and White women's responses to the term "slut" in both typical and supportive contexts.
Participants were exposed to the term "slut" while systematically varying the speaker's gender
and the context in which the term was used. Results indicated that both groups reported greater
empowerment in supportive contexts, with Black women showing a more substantial increase in
empowerment compared to White women. Unexpectedly, the supportive context did not lead to
more negative perceptions of the term "slut" among Black women. These findings suggest that,
in social justice contexts, the re-appropriation of the term may provide a sense of solidarity,
challenging stereotypes and offering opportunities for positive social change, despite its negative
connotations in typical settings. Strengths, weaknesses, and avenues for future research are
discussed.

Empowerment or Stereotypes? A Replication & Extension of the SlutWalk Study
The provocative term "slut" has long been a flashpoint for social commentary, but can it
foster positive social change when wielded within a social justice movement? This study delves
into this complex question, seeking to explore whether the pejorative term "slut" can lead to
constructive social consequences. The primary objectives of this study were twofold: first, to
replicate the influential findings of Gaucher et al. (2015), which examined the impact of
derogatory terms on women's experiences in social movements, and second, to broaden the scope
of this research by including a diverse sample of both Black and White women, thereby
enhancing the validity and applicability of the findings.
Previous research has indicated that even deeply ingrained derogatory terms like "slut"
can undergo transformation and lead to positive outcomes. For instance, Gaucher et al. (2015)
found that reclaiming such terms can decrease women's endorsement of rape myths, suggesting
that re-appropriation can disrupt harmful narratives and contribute to reshaping societal attitudes.
Similarly, Galinsky et al. (2013) demonstrated that self-labeling with racial slurs can lead to
personal and group empowerment, challenging who can use the term and signifying collective
action. These studies suggest that the re-appropriation of derogatory terms can be a powerful tool
in social movements, fostering a sense of empowerment and solidarity among marginalized
groups.
Despite these potential benefits, the re-appropriation of derogatory terms is not without
its challenges. The success of re-appropriation efforts often depends on the broader social and
cultural context, including the level of support from within the marginalized community and the
willingness of society at large to accept the redefined meanings, as noted by O’Dea et al., 2015.
Additionally, the process of re-appropriation can be contentious, as different members of the
marginalized group may have varying opinions on the appropriateness and effectiveness of
reclaiming certain terms (O’Dea et al., 2015).
Intersectional Perspectives: Media and Black Women's Experiences
Although there is a considerable body of research, understanding of how Black women
perceive the term "slut" remains limited. The experiences of slut-shaming among White and
Black women, particularly in media representations, reveal notable disparities shaped by
racialized perceptions. Media plays a crucial role in influencing societal norms and attitudes, yet
its portrayals are far from equitable. While depictions of White women in the media tend to be
more varied and multifaceted, Black women are disproportionately confined to narrow,
stereotypical roles that overly emphasize their sexuality (Franklin, 2017). Media portrayals of
White women tend to be more diverse, while Black women are disproportionately depicted in
limited, stereotypical roles that emphasize their sexuality (Franklin, 2017). These portrayals not
only reflect societal biases but also reinforce harmful stereotypes that shape public perceptions
and personal identities. White women are often portrayed in a variety of roles that highlight their
individuality, competence, and multifaceted personalities (Lewis, 2019). They are depicted as
professionals, homemakers, intellectuals, and adventurers, reflecting a broad spectrum of human
experiences. This diversity in representation allows White women to be seen as individuals with
unique identities (Entman & Rojecki, 2000). In stark contrast, the portrayal of Black women in
the media is much narrower. They are frequently depicted in roles that emphasize physical
attractiveness, sexuality, and servitude, such as the "jezebel", “sapphire” or "mammy"
stereotypes (Lewis, 2019). These limited portrayals do not represent the full scope of Black
women's lives and contributions. Instead, they reduce Black women to one-dimensional
characters, often focusing on their bodies and sexualities. The sexual exploitation of Black
women can be traced back to the belief that they were considered property, a concept that
emerged during the North Atlantic slave trade in 1619. Upon arriving in Jamestown and in
subsequent years, Black women were dehumanized, stripped of their dignity, and viewed solely
for their physical attributes and ability to reproduce (West, 2012). As property, White individuals
had the power to exploit them, with White men often subjecting Black women to sexual
violence. To rationalize this abuse, the Jezebel stereotype was introduced, depicting Black
women as inherently promiscuous and lacking in moral character (Sewell, 2013). These distorted
representations are far from benign; they reflect deep-seated societal biases and help perpetuate
them. For instance, the hyper sexualization of Black women can justify harassment and
discrimination in the real world. Additionally, these stereotypes can negatively affect how Black
women perceive themselves, often leading to internalized biases and diminished self-esteem.
For Black women, the trivialization of rape and the absence of justice are deeply
intertwined with narratives of sexual surveillance and the perception of their bodies as sexualized
objects. In their study, Rosenthal and Lobel (2016), examined how stereotypes about Black
American women relate to their sexuality and motherhood. In their online experimental study
involving 435 undergraduates, the researchers manipulated the race (Black or White) and
pregnancy status (pregnant or not) of a young woman depicted in photos and descriptions. The
results revealed that Black women, regardless of their pregnancy status, were viewed more
negatively in terms of sexual behavior, sexual risk, maternal status, and socioeconomic standing
compared to their White counterparts. This negative perception reinforces a broader societal
narrative that dehumanizes Black women and undermines their agency over their own bodies.
Additionally, the 'strong Black woman' trope, while highlighting resilience, also imposes
unrealistic expectations of unwavering strength. As White (2021) suggests, this can lead many
Black women to internalize derogatory terms to protect their image. In doing so, they may feel
pressured to accept harmful labels, such as being perceived as promiscuous or 'asking for it,' as a
form of defense to align with societal expectations of their supposed ‘strongness.’ This
combination of hypersexualization and enforced emotional invulnerability creates a double bind,
where Black women are seen as sexually deviant yet emotionally impervious, ultimately
hindering empathy, justice, and care when they face sexual violence. These stereotypes, as White
(2021) further argues, contribute to the psychological harm experienced by Black women, often
leading them to suppress their vulnerability in a society that systematically devalues their
humanity. This internalization results in a complex interplay between self-perception and societal
expectations, complicating the impact of derogatory terms.
The SlutWalk movement began in 2011 in response to a Toronto police officer’s remark
suggesting that women could avoid sexual assault by not dressing like “sluts”. In response,
women organized marches to protest rape culture and victim-blaming, aiming to reclaim the
word "slut" as a symbol of empowerment and bodily autonomy. However, the movement has
been criticized for its predominantly white, middle-class participation, with concerns that it
overlooks the experiences of marginalized women, particularly Black women, whose
experiences with sexualization and victimization are shaped by both race and gender (Black
Women’s Blueprint, 2011). The lack of representation of Black women in SlutWalk, coupled with
negative depictions in media, could influence how they interpret and respond to terms like
"slut." This exclusion highlights the importance of intersectionality in social justice movements,
ensuring that the voices and experiences of all marginalized groups are recognized and valued.
In their study, Gaucher et al. (2015) investigated whether the term "slut," typically
considered derogatory, could have positive social consequences when used within a social justice
movement like SlutWalk. The researchers conducted two experiments where they exposed
participants to the term "slut," varying the context (supportive march vs. negative context) and
the sex of the speaker. They found that women who encountered the term in a supportive march
context were less likely to endorse common rape myths compared to those who heard the term in
a negative context or not at all. Additionally, the term did not significantly reduce feelings of
empowerment in the supportive context compared to a march without the slur. These findings
suggest that "slut" can be re-appropriated in a positive way within supportive environments,
challenging the view that it is inherently derogatory. However, the original study had limitations,
notably its sample composition, which was predominantly White, with only 2.7% of Black
women participants. This underrepresentation overlooks the intersectionality of race and how it
might influence perceptions of the term "slut."
The current report intends to amplify the voices of Black women regarding the
re-appropriation of the word "slut." This investigative study delves into how Black women
experience and perceive the re-appropriation of this term, extending prior findings to encompass
a broader demographic. By centering their lived experiences and perspectives, this report aims to
shed light on the intersections of identity factors that shape social experiences and outcomes.
This study will provide valuable insights into the dynamics of social justice movements and
explore the potential of re-appropriated terms to foster empowerment and drive change. Through
this lens, the report will offer a more nuanced understanding of these dynamics and provide
insight for future research. The current study used a 2 (Context: typical vs. supportive) x 2
(Speaker: male vs. female) design to explore how the term "slut" is perceived in different
contexts and by different speakers. Participants were exposed to vignettes depicting someone
shouting "slut" either in a supportive SlutWalk setting or a typical street setting, with the speaker
being either male or female. They then completed measures on emotional reactions,
empowerment, self-objectification, and attitudes towards the term "slut". It was hypothesized
within the context of a collective march like SlutWalk, Black women would have more negative
perceptions of the term "slut" compared to White women due to the entrenched societal
stereotypes and heightened objectification they face regarding their sexuality. We hypothesized
that the term would continue to carry a stigmatizing impact for Black women, despite efforts to
re-appropriate it through collective action. Specifically, we anticipated that, contrary to the
intentions of the SlutWalk organizers, using "slut" in such marches may undermine the potential
positive effects of collective action and re-appropriation.
Methodology
Participants
A total of 251 participants were recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk).
Each participant received $1.20 USD as compensation for their participation in the seven-minute
study. Participants were recruited from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada,
meeting eligibility criteria of being at least 18 years old and having an approval rating of 97% or
higher on MTurk. Further requirements included identifying as a woman and being black or
white. Of these, 19 participants did not complete the study, leaving multiple measures
incomplete, and were subsequently excluded. Additionally, 8 participants did not identify as
women, and 6 did not identify as either Black or White, further reducing the sample size.
Ultimately, the final sample of participants was 218, all of whom identified as women: 90
(41.3%) identified as White and 128 (58.7%) identified as Black, with ages ranging from 18 to
71 years (M = 41.6, SD = 11.5). The socio-economic status (SES) of the participants varied, with
the average income among participants in the study was approximately $56,700.
Materials & Procedure
The study utilized a 2 (Context: typical vs. supportive) x 2 (Speaker: male vs. female)
experimental design. Initially, participants provided their demographic information and
completed the Privilege to Resist Scale (Hunt & Gaucher, 2013) 1 . Following this, participants
were exposed to the experimental manipulation, which involved reading first-person vignettes.
Participants were asked to imagine themselves in a scenario where someone to their left shouted
1the term "slut."
Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: a typical context (walking
down the street) or a supportive context (SlutWalk), with the speaker being either an out-group
(male) or an in-group (female) member. Specifically, those in the supportive context condition
read:
You are taking part in SlutWalk, a march calling for an end to sexual violence
against women and facilitating discussion surrounding sexual consent. Several
students, who are also participating in the march, surround you. Just as you reach
campus, you turn your head toward the school and hear a [man/woman] standing
to the left of you exclaim ‘Slut!’
Participants in the typical condition read the following:
You are on your way to class. Several students, who are also headed to
class, surround you. Just as you reach the campus, you turn your head toward the
school and hear a [man/woman] standing to the left of you exclaim ‘Slut!’
Next, all participants completed a questionnaire that contained the dependent measures.
Emotional Reactions. To assess emotional reactions participants completed a modified
version of the Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)(Watson et al., 1988).
Participants rated 20 emotions on a scale from 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely).
PANAS items were averaged to form three subscales assessing feelings of: (a) empowerment
(interested, excited, strong, enthusiastic, proud, alert, inspired, determined, attentive and active;
); (b) concern & apprehension (distressed, upset, scared, ashamed, nervous, jittery and
α = . 82
afraid; α =. 90 and (c) resistance and discomfort (guilty, hostile and irritable; α =. 62).
This scale was designed to assess participants’ privilege to resist the societal status quo (full scale α = .67) and contained items such as
“I would feel physically safe participating in a social demonstration” (1 1⁄4 strongly disagree, 7 1⁄4 strongly agree). Scores on the Privilege to Resist
Scale did not moderate any of the findings, and generally showed low reliability.
Empowerment. This scale, adapted by Galinsky et al. (2013), assesses participants' sense
of control, self-efficacy, and ability to impact their own circumstances. Participants rated three
items on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely), with questions such as “How [powerful/in
control/much influence] did you [feel/have] in the situation?”
(α =. 91).
Self-Objectification. The Self-Objectification Questionnaire was adapted by Noll and
Fredrickson, (1998). The scale measures how much individuals prioritize their physical
appearance compared to their skills and abilities. This scale evaluates how concerned
respondents are with their looks without including judgmental or evaluative elements.
Participants ranked various items, such as “health” (representing competence) and “sex appeal”
(representing appearance), on their significance to their self-concept, using a scale from 1 (least
impact) to 12 (most impact). Scores for appearance-related items were averaged to produce an
appearance composite (α = .44), and scores for competence-related items were averaged to
produce a competence composite (α = .32). A difference score was then calculated, with higher
values reflecting a greater emphasis on appearance (e.g., sex appeal) over competence (e.g.,
health).
Attitude towards the group-label. To assess views regarding the derogatory term slut
participants were asked, "How negative do you feel the label "slut" is?" Ratings ranged from 1
(not at all negative) to seven (extremely negative) scale.
Results
A series of 2 (Context: typical vs. supportive) X 2 (Speaker: male vs. female) X 2 (Race:
black vs. white) analysis of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted on each of the dependent
measures.
Emotional Responses
Confidence. A significant main effect of context was observed, F(1, 214) = 21.85, p <
.001, ηp² = 0.094. Additionally, a significant interaction between speaker and race was found,
F(1, 214) = 4.06, p = 0.045, ηp² = 0.019, showing that Black participants had a stronger positive
interactions were observed for this measure.
Fear. A main effect of speaker was observed for fear, F(1, 214) = 7.13, p = .008, ηp² =
0.033, where fear scores were higher for male speakers (M = 2.58, SD = 1.05) compared to

Distress. No significant effects were found, with neither context, speaker, nor race
significantly affecting distress levels for either group.
Social Consequences
Empowerment Scale. A significant main effect of context with higher scores in the
Supportive condition F(1, 214) = 27.06, p < .001, ηp² = 0.11. There was a significant interaction
between race and context, such that Black participants reported higher empowerment in the
supportive context (M = 3.07, SD = 1.00) compared to the typical context (M = 2.23, SD = 1.14),
and White participants showed a similar pattern, though with lower overall empowerment scores
Self-Objectification. No significant effects were observed across context, speaker, or
race, providing no support for the hypothesis here.
Attitudes toward the group label. Participants in both racial groups reported more
favorable attitudes in the typical context compared to the supportive context (Black: Typical M =
4.55, SD = 0.77; Supportive M = 4.03, SD = 1.07; White: Typical M = 4.14, SD = 1.14;
for this measure.
Discussion
The present study aimed to explore how Black and White women perceive the term "slut"
in different contexts, specifically focusing on typical and supportive environments, such as those
seen in social justice movements like SlutWalk. The goal was to understand whether race
influences how women respond to this term in contexts that encourage empowerment versus
those that do not. It was hypothesized that Black women would perceive the term more
negatively than White women due to the unique ways Black women are often stereotyped and
objectified in society. The findings partially supported this hypothesis. Black women reported
feeling more confident in the supportive context compared to the typical context, showing a
greater increase in confidence than White women. This suggests that supportive environments
may bolster Black women’s sense of empowerment. However, the results were not entirely
straightforward. Male speakers, regardless of context, elicited more fear in both Black and White
women, which indicates that the source of the derogatory term may influence its emotional
impact. No significant differences were found in distress or self-objectification across racial
groups, suggesting that emotional responses to the term "slut" are complex and may not always
follow expected patterns, particularly in supportive contexts. A surprising result was that both
Black and White women reported feeling more empowered in the supportive context than in the
typical setting, with Black women showing a larger increase in empowerment. This challenges
the assumption that Black women would view the term "slut" negatively, especially in a
collective action environment where re-appropriating the term might be expected to be
empowering. Instead, these findings suggest that, in a supportive setting, Black women might
find solidarity, which could mitigate the negative effects of the term. However, this outcome also
points to the complexities of re-appropriating derogatory language and how it intersects with
race and identity. Contrary to expectations, Black women did not experience higher levels of
self-objectification when the term "slut" was used in a supportive setting, suggesting that the
collective nature of movements like SlutWalk may provide a sense of protection, reducing the
risk of internalizing harmful stereotypes associated with the term.
While these findings add to the understanding of how race and context interact in the
perception of derogatory terms, several limitations must be acknowledged. One major limitation
is that participants were drawn from Canada, the United States, and the United
Kingdom—countries where social views on race, gender, and sexuality may be more liberal
compared to non-Western societies. The findings may not apply to Black women in countries
with more conservative cultural attitudes toward sexuality and gender, such as many African or
Caribbean nations, where the public discussion of sexual liberation may carry different
connotations (Jafri, 2020). Another limitation of the study is the use of vignettes to simulate
real-world experiences. While vignettes allow for controlled experimentation, they may not fully
capture the intensity and emotional impact of real-life situations like SlutWalk events. In real
life, encounters with derogatory terms are immediate and personal, potentially intensifying
emotional reactions. The emotional impact of hearing the word "slut" in a public, real-world
setting could differ significantly from the hypothetical scenarios presented in the study, where
participants had more emotional distance (Smith & Jones, 2015). Additionally, the study only
considered the gender of the speaker, but in real-life situations, the race of the speaker could
significantly influence how Black women perceive and react to derogatory terms. Research
indicates that Black women may experience heightened discomfort or distress when interacting
with White individuals, particularly in contexts involving racialized language or stereotypes (Sue
et al., 2007). This dynamic was not fully explored in the study but could have provided
additional insight into emotional responses to derogatory terms. Finally, while
self-objectification was measured, the reliability of this measure was low, which may have
limited the ability to detect differences in how Black women internalize the term "slut" in
different contexts. Future research could address the role of the speaker's race, use more
ecologically valid measures, and explore the impact of cultural differences in more conservative
societies.
The present study extends the Gaucher et al. (2015) study by exploring the intersection of
race and context in how Black and White women perceive the term "slut" in both typical and
supportive environments. While Gaucher et al. focused primarily on the SlutWalk movement and
the potential for pejorative terms to be re-appropriated in a positive way, the current study
specifically examined how these processes may differ based on racial identity. Both Black and
White women reported feeling more empowered in the supportive context compared to the
typical context, with Black women showing a greater increase in empowerment than White
women. Findings were consistent with Gaucher et al. (2015), with higher empowerment in a
supportive context, which suggests that solidarity within social justice movements like SlutWalk
can mitigate the negative emotional impact of derogatory terms (Gaucher et al., 2015). Culture
likely plays a role in this dynamic. Cultural identity and the shared experiences of
marginalization within both gender and racial contexts may make Black women particularly
attuned to the sense of community and support that emerges in solidarity-focused environments
(Sue et al., 2007). Cultural practices and historical experiences of Black women, such as the
collective struggle against racial and gender-based oppression, might also make them more
receptive to the empowering effects of a supportive group dynamic (Smith & Jones, 2015). In
contrast, White women may not be as attuned to group solidarity as Black women due to
differences in lived experiences. While Black women face both racial and gender-based
oppression, fostering a stronger sense of community in supportive environments, White women
are not subject to racial marginalization. Without the same historical or cultural experiences of
resilience, White women may not feel the same urgency for solidarity, which can influence their
responses to collective action differently from Black women. Cultural narratives of resilience and
solidarity in Black communities may further enhance the impact of such supportive contexts
(Jafri, 2020). By incorporating race as a central factor and examining both empowerment and
emotional responses to the term "slut" in different contexts, this study extends the work of
Gaucher et al. and provides deeper insight into how derogatory terms may be re-appropriated
across different racial groups.
In conclusion, the study contributes to the understanding of how Black and White women
perceive the term "slut" in different contexts, particularly within social justice movements like
SlutWalk. Although Black women did not always respond to the term in the negative way
expected, the supportive context did appear to empower them, suggesting that collective action
settings can provide a protective, affirming effect. These findings highlight the complexities of
re-appropriating derogatory terms, especially when race and gender intersect. They also suggest
that while movements like SlutWalk may not directly dismantle entrenched social hierarchies,
they succeed in raising awareness about critical issues such as sexual violence and
victim-blaming. Through these movements, derogatory terms like "slut" can become tools for
social change, sparking important conversations and challenging societal norms around sexuality,
victimhood, and gender.
