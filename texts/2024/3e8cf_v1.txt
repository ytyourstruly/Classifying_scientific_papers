Abstract
Background: Mobile health interventions are promising behaviour change tools, but
they might benefit deprived populations less. Evidence so far mainly stems from analyses of
clinical trial data, which may suffer from selection bias. This systematic review investigated
differences in uptake of, engagement with, and effectiveness of exclusively mobile
interventions for diet, physical activity, and sedentary behaviour (i.e., weight-related
behaviours) in adults and in real-life contexts.
Methods: Five databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science)
were searched from inception to November 2023. Records were independently screened by
two authors. Observational studies including adults were considered if they reported on
uptake, engagement, and/ or effectiveness of an exclusively mobile intervention, and
examined outcomes by at least one inequality indicator included in the PROGRESS-Plus
framework. Risk of bias was assessed with a tool for observational studies provided by the
NIH.
Results: Of the 9707 identified records, 87 publications reporting on 88 studies were
included. Most studies reported on intervention uptake (k = 53) and examined multiple
inequality indicators, with the majority studying age (k = 74) or gender/ sex (k = 79).
Furthermore, studies investigated indicators of socio-economic position including education
(k = 41) and income (k = 26). Younger age and higher socio-economic position were mostly
associated with increased uptake, although these differences did not translate to
engagement or effectiveness. Results for other inequality indicators were mixed, and some
(e.g. migration [k = 4], sexual orientation [k = 1]) were rarely studied.
Conclusions: Evidence regarding a digital health divide remains mixed, although
some barriers to the uptake of mobile interventions, such as access to the required
technology and digital literacy exist. Research urgently needs to address potential
inequalities beyond age, gender/sex and socio-economic position to ensure that mobile
interventions do not widen existing health inequalities.
Registration: The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021290769).

Inequalities in exclusively mobile interventions
targeting weight-related behaviours: Systematic
review of observational studies
Introduction
Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are a specific form of digital health
interventions that use mobile, often Internet-supported, tools such as smartphone
applications, tablets, and wearables to promote health and wellbeing, or remotely support
treatment and disease self-management (1). With the current widespread use of
smartphones, mHealth interventions are available to a large number of people (2) and, as
such, might be able to increase access to health information, support and care (3). Weight-
related behaviours like physical activity, sedentary behaviour and diet are important
precursors for physical and mental health, illness and mortality (4-7). mHealth interventions
also have certain important benefits, e.g., advice or support can be received quickly at any
time and place, personalization and tailoring of intervention content is usually possible, and
the user can manage their health and wellbeing in an autonomous way). Therefore, it comes
as no surprise that many mHealth interventions have been developed and evaluated that
aim to promote sufficient physical activity and a healthy diet and to prevent low levels of
sedentary behaviour (e.g., (8, 9)).
To achieve an impact on population health, mHealth interventions must not only
reach the target group but at the same time be accessible and easy to use. Intervention
users should also show sufficient objective (e.g., uptake and continued usage as long as
needed) and subjective engagement (e.g., enjoyment and perceived usefulness) with the
intervention. Moreover, the interventions also need to be effective in promoting the desired
behavioural change (10). Previous research has shown that mHealth interventions can be as
effective as face-to-face interventions in increasing physical activity (11, 12) and reducing
sedentary behaviour (13), yet uptake and engagement are not often reported (14).
Furthermore, when intervention uptake is discussed, the information usually relates to the
included sample size only and does not relate to the extent to which the sample is
representative of the target population, or at least comparable to non-users (15).
This is problematic, as evidence about a digital health divide exists, i.e., the
phenomenon that digital interventions tend to benefit the more affluent and privileged users
more than their less-privileged counterparts (16). Indeed, based on an extensive systematic
review, Western and colleagues concluded that digital interventions promoting physical
activity are effective among adults of high socioeconomic position (SEP) yet not among
adults with low SEP (17). Besides these differences in intervention effectiveness, research
has shown that less privileged populations, e.g., people with lower levels of education, a
lower income, older age, ethnically minoritized populations, and people from rural areas,
show lower uptake and less continuous use of mHealth interventions (e.g., (18)). This further
limits the potential public health impact of these interventions. While digital health
interventions have been previously described as having the potential to decrease existing
inequalities for people with lower SEP, e.g., when it concerned smoking cessation (19),
these recent findings indicate that mHealth interventions might in fact contribute to widening
inequalities between more and less privileged populations.
In a previous systematic review (20), our team made a first contribution to determine
whether a digital health divide indeed exists by investigating whether the uptake of,
engagement with, and effectiveness of mobile interventions for weight-related behaviours
(i.e., diet, physical activity, and sedentary behaviour) differed depending on a predetermined
set of inequality indicators (i.e., socioeconomic position, age, gender, level of education,
health and digital literacy, sexual orientation, health services accessibility, or geographical
location). Importantly, this previous review revealed that engagement with and effectiveness
of mobile interventions may be influenced by certain sociodemographic variables. We found,
for example, that older adults, adults in lower-skilled jobs, and those living in rural areas
might benefit less from mHealth interventions aimed at weight-loss than their younger
counterparts, adults who hold higher-skilled jobs, or people who live in urban areas.
However, it also became clear that the evidence of a digital health divide is inconclusive and
needs further investigation (20). A potential explanation for the inconclusive findings may be
that we only included experimental research designs, the majority of which were randomized
controlled trials (RCTs). These RCTs consistently reported findings that are different from
studies applying other research designs (e.g., single-group pre-post studies). Enrolment,
participation, and retention in RCTs may have inherent barriers such as information about
the trial being difficult to understand for people with low levels of (health) literacy and burden
due to time commitment (21, 22). This means samples in RCTs are often not representative
of the general population (23). Data about freely available mobile interventions may provide
a more realistic picture of intervention uptake, engagement, and effectiveness in real-life
settings. However, our previous inclusion criteria used to select studies (i.e., any intervention
trial that enabled us to compare groups by at least one inequality indicator was included)
prevented us from including studies with observational research designs.
To more comprehensively answer the question of whether a digital health divide
exists when it comes to mHealth interventions for weight-related behaviors, we therefore
believe it is crucial to continue this work and to address the research gap that pertains. Thus,
the research question for the present systematic review is the following: does the uptake of,
engagement with, and effectiveness of digital interventions for diet, physical activity, and
sedentary behaviour differ depending on potential inequality indicators, based on evidence
from any quantitative observational study, including cross-sectional and cohort studies?
Methods
The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-
analysis (PRISMA) guidelines (24). The study protocol was registered on the International
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42021290769) prior to
conducting the search. Raw extracted data, reasons for exclusion at the full-text screening
stage, and analysis scripts can be downloaded from the project’s Open Science Framework
Eligibility criteria
To be included in this systematic review, studies had to focus exclusively on adults
aged 18 and over with no apparent pre-existing medical condition. Studies furthermore had
to report on the uptake of, engagement with, or effectiveness of exclusively mobile
interventions (e.g., smartphone apps, wearables, or mobile games without any intervention
components that were delivered through other means) for the promotion of weight-related
behaviours (physical activity, sedentary behaviour, diet) or weight loss. Results had to be
reported separately by at least one of the following inequality indicators taken from the
PROGRESS-Plus criteria (25): place of residence, race/ethnicity/culture/language,
occupation, gender/sex, religion, education, socio-economic position (e.g., income), social
capital (e.g., relationships), personal characteristics associated with discrimination (e.g., age,
disability), features of relationships (e.g., excluded from school), or other time-depending
relationships where an individual may be temporarily at a disadvantage. Only studies
published in English were eligible. Studies were excluded if they reported interventions that
included intervention components using any other means of delivery (e.g., face-to-face
contact), or focused on patient populations, children, or adolescents. Systematic reviews,
meta-analyses, and study protocols were excluded, as were conference abstracts and
records for which no full text could be retrieved.
Search strategy
The electronic searches were conducted by CF in consultation with an Information
Specialist from the University of Hull. The following databases were searched: PsycINFO
(Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science Core
Collection (see Supplemental Material for the full MEDLINE search strategy). MeSH terms
were developed to search for all key concepts and modified for each database. Keyword
searches restricted to abstract, title, and keyword headings were also completed. Boolean
logic was used to combine the terms. The search strategy can be found on the project’s OSF
page. Databases were initially searched from inception to 29 November 2021 with no
language or country limits applied. The search was updated on 29 November 2023 to
include studies from 29 November 2021 onwards. Additionally, we conducted a backward
and forward citation search of all initially included studies through an electronic search on
Google Scholar.
Screening
All records identified by the electronic search were exported to Endnote 20,
deduplicated and uploaded into Covidence (Covidence Systematic Review Software, Veritas
Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia). Titles and abstracts of all studies were screened
independently by two reviewers each (LK, CF, JW, ZG). Afterwards, full texts were screened
by two reviewers (LK, CF, JW, ZG). Disagreements were resolved by discussion.
Data extraction and synthesis
A data extraction form was developed based on guidelines from the Cochrane
Collaboration (26). Study characteristics (first author, paper title, year of publication, journal,
study aim, study design, geographical setting of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria),
information about setting and population (including sampling strategy and recruitment),
target behaviours and social inequality indicators, the intervention (modes of delivery,
description of intervention content), the sample (sample size, socio-demographic and health-
related characteristics), operationalisation of outcomes and the main findings related to the
research questions for this systematic review were extracted. Data extraction was performed
independently by two reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Narrative
synthesis was conducted to summarise the findings of the studies for the identified inequality
indicators by outcome (uptake, engagement, effectiveness).
Quality appraisal
The quality of included studies was assessed for risk of bias using the NIH tool for
observational cohort and cross-sectional studies (27). This tool is composed of fourteen
questions focusing on concepts that are key to a study’s internal validity. For each question,
reviewers provide a rating, with the option to indicate that the question is not applicable (NA),
that the answer cannot be determined based on the information provided in the paper (CD),
or that the issue addressed by the question is not reported on at all (NR). For the specific
purpose of the present review, instead of providing a rating of ‘Good’, ‘Fair’ or ‘Poor’ for each
question, we answered each question with ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ as the middle option was
experienced as very prone to subjectivity by reviewers. Also, we decided to split four of the
fourteen questions into sub-questions (i.e., 4a, 4b; 5a, 5b; 9a-c; 11a-c) as this allowed us to
provide a more specific answer to these questions and thus provide a more accurate risk of
bias assessment.
Since the tool does not provide explicit guidelines for assigning an overall risk of bias
rating to a study, but rather advises that each study should be assessed individually based
on the details reported (27), after the scoring of the papers we proceeded with a colour-
coded approach. Specifically, we categorized the answers into three levels: green (i.e., when
answered with ‘Yes’ or with ‘NA’ given the study design), yellow (i.e., when not all sub-
questions were answered as ‘Yes’), and red (i.e., for ‘No’ answers). We then counted the
number of greens per study to provide an overall quality rating (i.e., ‘Poor’ for six greens or
less; ‘Fair’ for seven to ten greens; ‘Good’ for eleven to fourteen greens).
The risk of bias assessments of the studies were conducted independently by two
reviewers per study (DS assessed all; AD and ES each coded half of the included studies).

Results
Study selection
Including the update, a total of 9707 records were retrieved after removing
duplicates. From these, 203 were included in the full text screening, and 49 publications
were included in the review. Through handsearching, another 38 publications were
1). Since one publication reported on two separate datasets, the final number of studies
included in the narrative synthesis is K = 88. A list of studies excluded at the full-text
screening stage and the reason for exclusion can be downloaded from the OSF
Study and intervention characteristics
Studies were mostly conducted in the USA (k = 31 only in the USA (28-58); k = 2
USA and Canada (59, 60); k = 1 USA and South Korea (61)). Others used international
samples without specifying the countries of origin (62-73) (k = 12), or samples from
Germany (74-77), the Netherlands (78-81), the UK (82-84) (each k = 4), Canada (85-87),
China (88-90), Japan (91-93), Saudi Arabia (94-96) (each k = 3), Australia (97, 98), Poland
(99, 100), Thailand (101, 102) (each k = 2), Brazil (103), Ethiopia (104), Hong Kong (105),
Malaysia (106), Singapore (107), Sweden (108), and Taiwan (109) (each k = 1). Five studies
did not specify where data were collected (110-114). Sample sizes ranged between N = 29
and N = 12,363,555, with a median of N = 1,368 participants.
Most included studies were cross-sectional surveys (30, 36, 37, 41-44, 47, 50, 51,
55, 57, 61, 67, 74, 78-81, 84, 85, 90, 94-96, 98-100, 103, 104, 106, 108, 114), reported on
single waves of cohort studies or longitudinal surveys (31-34, 39, 40, 49, 53, 58, 76, 82, 86,
87, 91, 93, 97, 105), a survey embedded in a clinical trial (38), or surveys among users of a
healthcare system or provider (35, 48, 52, 54, 56, 92, 101, 102, 107, 109). Finally, some
studies used data from commercial mobile apps such as MyFitnessPal (28, 77), Noom (29,
45, 46, 63-66, 68, 71), LoseIt (59, 62, 69, 70) and others (60, 72, 73, 75, 83, 88, 89, 110-
113).
Most studies investigated smartphone apps only (28-32, 35, 38-40, 42, 44-46, 50, 53,
54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 62-80, 82, 83, 88-97, 99, 101-106, 109, 111, 112, 114), while some
investigated wearables only (including smartwatches) (33, 34, 37, 41, 43, 47, 48, 51, 52, 55,
58, 61, 85, 87, 98) or both (36, 49, 81, 84, 86, 100, 107, 108, 110). Three studies also
included smart scales (100, 110, 113).
Thirty-eight studies focused on diet as the target behaviour (28, 30-32, 35, 36, 39,
40, 42, 49, 50, 53, 56, 57, 59, 60, 62, 64, 69, 72, 74, 76-78, 86, 94, 96, 98-101, 104-106,
109, 111, 112, 114), 57 studies focused on physical activity (30-34, 36, 39-44, 47-53, 55, 56,
59-61, 64, 67, 69, 73-76, 78-89, 91-96, 98, 100, 101, 104-108, 115), and 36 studied weight
(29, 36, 38, 39, 42, 45, 46, 49, 50, 53, 54, 58, 60, 62-66, 68-72, 74, 90, 94-96, 100, 102,
103, 105, 110, 111, 113, 114). The majority of studies focused on one target behaviour, but
18 studies addressed two (30-32, 40, 56, 59, 62, 72, 76, 78, 86, 87, 95, 98, 101, 104, 106,
111, 114), and 14 addressed all three target behaviours simultaneously (36, 39, 42, 49, 50,
53, 60, 64, 69, 74, 94, 96, 100, 105).
The majority of studies focused on mobile intervention uptake (k = 53) (30-36, 39-42,
44, 46, 49-53, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 67, 71, 74, 76, 78-86, 90, 93-97, 99, 100, 103-106, 108,
113, 114), followed by engagement (k = 31) (35, 37, 43, 47-49, 60, 62-64, 67, 69-73, 75, 77,
80, 82, 83, 85, 87, 89, 90, 94, 97, 98, 101, 107, 111, 112) and effectiveness (k = 29) (28, 29,
38, 43, 45, 54, 57, 59, 60, 63-66, 68, 72, 73, 82, 83, 88, 91, 92, 96, 97, 102, 109-113), with
22 studies investigating several of these endpoints (35, 43, 49, 59, 60, 63, 64, 67, 71, 73, 79,
82, 83, 85, 90, 94, 96, 97, 111-113, 116). Most studies included gender or sex (k = 79), age
(k = 74) and various indicators of SEP including education (k = 41), income (k = 26),
employment or occupation (k = 17), or SEP composite scores (k = 7). A total of 25 studies
reported on potential racial or ethnic disparities. Thirteen studies included location; most
either compared urban and rural areas within a country or compared countries or continents.
Migration status was taken into account in k = 4 studies. Some studies also included a range
of relationship factors such as marital or relationship status (k = 17), having children (k = 6),
cohabiting (k = 4), having sick family members (k = 1) or sexual orientation (k = 1). Finally, a
small number of studies also addressed health-related social inequality indicators such as
having chronic conditions or comorbidities (k = 14), health insurance coverage or utilization
outcome.
Quality appraisal
Out of the 87 papers, only one (48) was assessed as having a poor quality. The
majority, i.e., 66 papers (29-34, 36-44, 47, 49-55, 57, 59-67, 69-75, 77, 79-83, 85, 86, 88,
89, 91, 94-96, 98, 100, 105-114), were rated as of fair quality and a total of twenty papers
(28, 35, 45, 46, 56, 58, 68, 76, 78, 84, 87, 90, 92, 93, 97, 99, 101-104) were rated as of good
quality. An aspect that was very often rated as red was whether key potential confounding
variables were measured and adjusted statistically for their impact on the relationship
between exposure(s) and outcome(s). Also, while variance and effect size estimates were
often provided, a power calculation was very often missing, which resulted in this aspect
often being rated as yellow. Similarly, while the exposure and outcome measures were often
clearly defined and implemented consistently across all study participants, it was often
unclear whether valid and reliable measures were used, yielding this aspect yellow too.
Aspects that were often labelled as green related to the formulation of the research question
or objective and the specification and definition of the target population. Full details of the
quality appraisal can be found in the supplementary material.
Uptake
Gender and sex
Forty-seven studies tested for gender or sex differences in mobile intervention
uptake, with seventeen reporting significant differences. Almost all of these studies reported
that uptake was higher in women than men (33, 34, 36, 39-41, 49, 51, 52, 55, 58, 79, 85, 90,
106, 114). Only Oba et al. (93) reported higher uptake rates for physical activity-related apps
in men than women in Japan. Seven reported mixed results, typically with gender
differences emerging for the uptake of some but not all mobile interventions (53, 61, 76, 81,
86, 105, 113). For example, König et al. (76) reported gender differences in the uptake of
diet, but not physical activity apps. Shen et al. (105) reported opposite findings, with women
having lower uptake rates only for physical activity-related apps. In addition, Janssen et al.
(81) reported higher uptake rates in women than men for apps, but not sports watches. Rha
et al. (61) suggested an interaction between gender and culture, with uptake rates being
higher in women than men in the USA, but not in South Korea. Shaw et al. (53) reported
gender to be associated with uptake, but this association was rendered non-significant if
other predictors such as age, education and health insurance coverage were included in the
model. Another seven studies only reported results narratively but did not provide results of
statistical tests; all but one (69) reported higher uptake in women than men (46, 59, 83, 94,
96, 97). The remaining 16 studies found no gender differences in mobile intervention uptake
(30-32, 35, 42, 50, 56, 74, 78, 80, 84, 95, 100, 103, 108).
Age
Forty-eight studies tested for age differences in mobile intervention uptake. Twenty-
nine reported significant differences. Almost all of these studies reported higher uptake in
younger than older age groups (30-35, 42, 49, 51-53, 58, 67, 74, 76, 78-82, 84, 85, 93, 95,
99, 103, 105, 106). Only Teferi et al. (104) reported students older than 25 years to be more
likely to use mobile interventions than students aged 25 years and younger. Three studies
reported mixed findings. In Zarnowski et al. (100), app and wearable users tended to be
younger, while there were no age differences for the uptake of smart scales. Hahn et al. (39)
only found age differences in dietary self-monitoring app uptake for men, but not women;
uptake was lower in younger vs older men. In Rha et al. (61), older age was associated with
lower uptake in the US, but not the South Korean sample. Six studies summarized their
findings narratively without statistically testing relationships (46, 59, 83, 94, 97); this mainly
focused on reporting mean ages or typical age ranges which do not allow drawing
conclusions about potential age differences in uptake. In Alshathri et al. (94), app users were
older than non-users, while in Mitchell et al. (46), non-users were somewhat older than
users. Mean ages of engagement groups reported in Serrano et al. (69) all ranged between
29.7 and 30.8 years, suggesting no age differences. The remaining 10 studies reported no
relationships of uptake with age (36, 44, 50, 55, 56, 71, 86, 90, 108, 114).
Race and ethnicity
Eighteen studies investigated relationships between race or ethnicity and mobile
intervention uptake. Eight studies reported significant findings, but the direction of results
was mixed. White individuals were less likely to use mobile interventions than individuals of
other ethnicities in five studies (31, 32, 34, 42, 53). Three studies, on the other hand,
reported Caucasians or White individuals to be more likely to start using mobile interventions
(30, 33, 35). One study reported mixed results regarding statistical significance: for women,
ethnicity was not related to intervention uptake. For men, however, Hispanic and Latino men
were most likely to use weight-related self-monitoring apps, while mixed race men were least
likely (39). The remaining nine studies reported no significant relationships (41, 49-52, 56,
58, 99, 103).
Migration and location
Migration. Only two studies investigated migration status in relation to mobile
intervention uptake and results were mixed. One found that non-Saudi nationals living in
Saudi Arabia had lower uptake rates (95); the other, a survey conducted in Germany, found
that participants with a native language other than German were more likely to use health
apps (74).
Location. Eleven studies examined potential differences in uptake in relation to
location. Four studies reported statistically significant findings, but direction of effects varied.
One study reported rural residents to be more likely than urban residents to use mobile
interventions (84), while three others reported the opposite effect (31, 32, 85). Rha et al. (61)
reported differences between countries: US residents were less likely to use wearable health
devices than South Korean citizens. One study reported mixed results: urban residents were
more likely to use physical activity-related apps, but there was no urban-rural divide for diet-
related apps, use of wearables, or smart scales (100). Two studies (46, 94) broke down user
rates by region within Saudi Arabia and the USA, respectively, but did not statistically test for
differences. The remaining three studies did not report statistically significant differences (49,
53, 58).
Sexual orientation
Sexual orientation was only considered in one study, where it was unrelated to health
app uptake (99).
Socio-economic position
Education. Thirty-one studies investigated the relationship between education and
mobile intervention uptake. Twenty-one studies reported statistically significant differences;
they consistently reported that a higher education level was associated with higher uptake
rates (30-35, 39, 42, 44, 49, 51-53, 56, 58, 85, 93, 95, 105, 106, 108). Another two studies
reported mixed findings. O’Loughlin et al. (86) found that higher educational attainment was
only associated with physical activity app uptake, but not with diet app uptake. Contrary
results were reported by König et al. (76), who found educational attainment only to be
positively associated with diet, but not physical activity app use. One study reported a
breakdown of education categories (high school, Bachelor’s degree, postgraduate) by app
user category but did not statistically test for differences (94). The remaining seven studies
reported non-significant results (74, 78, 80, 81, 100, 103, 114).
Income. Eighteen studies studied income in relation to mobile intervention uptake.
Twelve reported statistically significant relationships between income and uptake, with
higher income being consistently associated with higher uptake rates (32-36, 42, 44, 49, 51,
58, 93, 105). Another three studies reported mixed findings. In one study, higher income was
only associated with physical activity app uptake, but not with diet app uptake (86). In Shaw
et al. (53), higher income was only significantly associated with uptake before controlling for
other social inequality indicators. Finally, Rha et al. (61) suggests a moderation by location,
with higher income only being associated with wearable device uptake in the USA, but not in
South Korea. One study did not statistically test for relationships but reported a breakdown
of household income categories by app uptake (user, ex-user, nonuser; (94)). Two further
studies reported non-significant results (36, 56).
Employment or occupation. Employment or occupation were considered in twelve
studies. Five of them reported statistically significant relationships. Holding a (full-time) job
was associated with increased uptake rates (44, 52, 93, 95). Pontin et al. (83) reported
inverse associations, with individuals in higher managerial positions being less likely to use
health-related apps. Another two studies reported mixed findings. In O’Loughlin et al. (86),
being employed was only associated with using physical activity, but not diet apps. In
Zarnowski et al. (100), being employed was associated with using physical activity and diet
apps and wearables, but not with using smart scales. One study descriptively reported
employment status by app user category without statistically testing for differences (94).
Four studies reported no significant results (31, 53, 74, 114).
SEP composite score. Five studies used composite measures for SEP; four
reported statistically significant relationships with mobile intervention uptake. Lower social
grade, a low index of deprivation and lower self-rated social class were associated with
reduced likelihood of wearable uptake (84, 114), as was a lower SEP score (103). In Hahn et
al. (39), a lower SES score was only related to a reduced likelihood of mobile intervention
app use in men, but not in women.
Relationship factors
Marital or relationship status. Potential associations between marital or
relationship status and mobile intervention uptake were tested in fourteen studies. Three of
them reported statistically significant results. Being married was associated with an
increased likelihood of using a mobile health intervention in two studies (53, 85) and with a
lower likelihood in another (106). In the same study, being widowed was associated with an
increased likelihood of intervention uptake (106). In Zarnowski et al. (100), only the use of
physical and diet apps were more prevalent in singles, while there was no significant
association with using wearables or smart scales. The remaining nine studies reported null
results (30, 31, 33, 34, 36, 44, 61, 93, 95).
Having children. The relationship between mobile intervention uptake and having
children was tested in five studies, of which two reported statistically significant results. In
one of these studies, having children was associated with lower likelihood of intervention
uptake (35), while in the other it was associated with an increased likelihood of intervention
uptake (93). Two more studies reported mixed findings. In Rha et al. (61), having children
was only positively associated with wearable device uptake in the US, but not the South
Korean subsample. In Zarnowski et al. (100), having children was associated with a lower
likelihood of using physical activity and diet apps, but not with using wearables or smart
scales. One reported null results (95).
Cohabitation. Living in one household with others was taken into consideration in
two studies. Lee et al. (106) reported that individuals living with friends were more likely to
use mobile health interventions than individuals living alone. In Zarnowski et al. (100), living
with others was only positively associated with wearable use, but not with the uptake of
physical activity or diet apps or smart scales.
Having sick family members. Only one study took into account caring for sick
relatives, which was positively associated with health app uptake (30).
Health-related social inequality indicators
Having chronic conditions or comorbidities. The relationship between having
chronic conditions or comorbidities and mobile intervention uptake was tested in twelve
studies. Six of them reported statistically significant findings. In five of them, individuals with
chronic conditions were more likely to use health apps than individuals without chronic
conditions (36, 49, 74, 95, 106). In the study, chronic conditions were associated with a
decreased likelihood of using wearables (58). One additional study reported mixed results:
the likelihood of using a physical activity app was reduced in individuals with a chronic
condition, while it was unrelated to the use of diet apps, wearables, and smart scales (100).
The remaining five studies did not find significant associations (31, 33, 34, 42, 44).
Health insurance coverage or utilization. Six studies examined the relationship
between health insurance coverage or utilization and uptake of mobile health interventions.
Having health insurance was positively associated with mobile intervention uptake in two
studies (31, 58). One study descriptively reported the type of health insurance respondents
had by app uptake (46). The remaining three studies reported null results (44, 53, 56).
Regular provider or primary care visits. The association between regular provider
or primary care visits and mobile intervention uptake was tested in four studies. All reported
nonsignificant findings (31, 33, 34, 36).
Disability status. One study took into account disability status and found that having
a limiting disability reduced the likelihood of mobile intervention uptake (84).
Engagement
Gender and sex
Potential gender or sex disparities in engagement were tested in twenty-six studies.
Twelve studies reported significant differences. Men engaged more in six studies (43, 48,
49, 62, 63, 89), while women engaged more than men in another six studies (47, 70, 83, 90,
97, 101). Two studies reported mixed results. Torres et al. (72) reported higher retention in
men, but no sex differences for intervention component use. Molina et al. (73) found that
women engaged more than men with some intervention components. One study reported
gender differences descriptively without a statistical test (94). Nine studies found no gender
differences in intervention engagement (35, 37, 60, 75, 77, 80, 85, 87, 98, 111, 112).
Age
Relationships between age and intervention engagement were tested in twenty-five
studies. Fourteen reported significant results. Engagement was lower in younger users in ten
studies (35, 37, 43, 62, 70, 72, 83, 89, 97, 101). In another three studies, engagement was
higher in younger than older users (48, 49, 60). Younger users were more likely to use social
intervention components in one study (77). Two reported results only descriptively (71, 94).
Nine studies reported non-significant associations (47, 67, 75, 80, 82, 85, 87, 90, 98).
Race and ethnicity
Potential disparities based on race and ethnicity were tested in eight studies. Four
studies reported significant results. Black and African American users engaged more with
mobile interventions in Lewis et al. (43). Similarly, White individuals were more likely to
abandon the intervention according to Nuss et al. (47). Pevnick et al. (48), however, reported
that early adopters of mobile health technology were more likely to be White, and Rising et
al. (49) reported the engaged users were less likely to be Black. Gorny et al. (107) only
reported a breakdown by ethnicity descriptively. Three studies reported null findings (35, 37,
72).
Migration and location
Migration. Migration status was considered in two studies. Pevnick et al. (48)
reported that early adopters of digital health technology were more likely to have English as
their native language and thus no migration history. O’Loughlin et al. (87), however, found no
differences based on migration.
Location. Location was examined in three studies. There were no differences in
engagement based on geographical location in Rising et al. (49) or region in Macridis et al.
(85). Alshathri et al. (94) only reported a descriptive breakdown by region within Saudi
Arabia.
Socio-economic position
Education. Relationships between education and intervention engagement were
tested in twelve studies. Four reported statistically significant results. In two studies, higher
educational attainment was associated with increased engagement (75, 89), while in another
two studies, higher educational attainment was associated with decreased engagement (47,
77). Two studies only reported descriptive breakdowns (94, 107). Six studies reported no
significant associations (35, 37, 49, 80, 85, 98).
Income. Nine studies examined relationships between income and intervention
engagement. Six studies reported statistically significant associations. One study reported
intervention engagement to be higher in high- vs low-income countries (64), and another
study reported increased engagement in individuals with higher income (37). One study
reported that individuals with higher income were more likely to engage with diet tracking
components (77), and another reported high-income users to be especially engaged with
physical activity-related components (89). However, three studies reported engagement to
be lower in individuals with higher income (47-49). Another study only reported a descriptive
breakdown of categories (94). One study reported null findings (35).
Employment or occupation. Six studies investigated employment or occupation in
relation to intervention engagement. Four reported significant findings. Pevnick et al. (48)
indicated that early adopters of health technology were more likely to be employed by a
health insurance company. Stehr et al. (77) found stronger engagement in employed users.
Friel et al. (37) reported engaged intervention users to be more frequently employed full-time
compared to former intervention users, while Fischer et al. (75) reported that intervention
completers were more often retired and less often employed. Two more studies only
provided descriptive results without statistical tests (83, 94).
SEP composite score. SEP composite measures were related to engagement in
one study which reported no significant associations (87).
Relationship factors
Having sick family members and sexual orientation was not studied with regards to
intervention engagement.
Marital or relationship status. Differences in engagement based on the marital or
relationship status were tested in three studies. Current intervention users were more likely
to be in a relationship than former users in one study (98). Two other studies reported no
significant association (75, 85).
Having children. Coughlin et al. (35) reported that having children was associated
with reduced intervention engagement.
Cohabitation. Friel et al. (37) indicated that current intervention users were more
likely to cohabit than former intervention users.
Health-related social inequality indicators
Regular provider or primary care visits and disability status were not studied in
relation to mobile intervention engagement.
Having chronic conditions or comorbidities. The relationship between chronic
conditions or comorbidities and mobile intervention engagement was addressed in three
studies. Two of them reported statistically significant findings. Individuals with at least one
chronic condition used intervention features such as challenges and rewards and badges
less frequently (43). Rising et al. (49) reported users with chronic conditions to engage more
frequently with app-based interventions. Pevnick et al. (48) reported no effects.
Health insurance coverage or utilization. One study tested the relationship
between health insurance coverage or utilization and intervention engagement, reporting null
findings (48).
Effectiveness
Gender and sex
Twenty-seven studies tested for potential gender- or sex-related disparities. Twelve
studies reported statistically significant differences. Men were more successful in losing
weight than women (45, 65, 68, 102) and also reported higher levels of physical activity due
to the intervention (83, 88). Chin et al. (63) also reported men to lose more weight, but also
to experience greater weight regain after the intervention. In Lewis et al. (43), self-reported
helpfulness of wearables including social features was higher in men than in women.
Labonté et al. (60) furthermore suggests that gender may interact with engagement and
weight status at baseline, with women benefiting more than men if their engagement is high.
Jacobs et al. (66) reported greater changes in Body-Mass Index (BMI) for women compared
to men. In Hendrie et al. (97), women increased both the amount and types of vegetables
consumed, while men only increased the types of vegetables consumed. Silberman et al.
(54) reported that both men and women lost weight at equal rates, but these findings were
qualified by an interaction with age, where women aged 18 to 39 lost weight at a higher rate
than women aged 40 to 59. For men, there were no differences based on age group. One
study reported mixed results: although there were no gender differences in physical activity,
men indicated more strongly that Pokémon Go was beneficial to their health (82). Two
studies only reported results descriptively without a statistical test (91, 92), and one study
provided a statistical test, but no information about the direction of the significant effect of
gender (64). Eleven studies reported null results (38, 57, 59, 72, 73, 96, 109-113).
Age
Eighteen studies tested for age effects in mobile intervention effectiveness. Ten
studies reported statistically significant differences. Calorie intake was lower in older age
groups (59), vegetable intake higher (97), levels of physical activity higher (88), and older
age groups were found to be more successful in losing weight compared to younger age
groups (54). Age groups also differed in the type of physical activity engaged in, with cycling
and running being more popular in adults between 30 and 60, while going to the gym was
more popular with younger adults. Generally, adults between 30 and 60 also moved less
than other age groups (83). Three studies found that older adults showed smaller reductions
in BMI than younger adults (65, 66, 102), and reported higher body weight in older versus
younger users (64). Younger adults found wearables with social features more helpful
compared to older adults (43). Two studies only reported results descriptively without
providing statistical tests (60, 91). Six studies found no effects of age on effectiveness (29,
38, 45, 57, 72, 109).
Race and ethnicity
Three studies addressed potential disparities due to race and ethnicity. All of them
reported statistically significant findings. White individuals were more successful in losing
weight than Black or Hispanic individuals in one study (38) and less successful in another
(72). White participants found wearables with social features less helpful than participants of
other ethnicities (43).
Migration and location
Migration status was not studied in relation to intervention effectiveness. The
relationship with location was tested in three studies, all of which reported statistically
significant results. Urban residents reported higher levels of physical activity compared to
rural residents (88). People living in postal code areas with higher median grocery store
access also reported consuming more fruits and vegetables, less sugar-sweetened
beverages, and lower BMIs (28). Jacobs et al. (66) reported on continent-level differences
with European users losing more weight than American users, who again lost more weight
than African and Latin American users.
Socio-economic position
Education. Four studies investigated education, out of which two reported significant
associations with intervention effectiveness. Education was positively associated with
behaviour change (57). Similarly, in postal codes with above median education, individuals
report higher fruit and vegetable consumption and less fast food and sugar-sweetened
beverage consumption (28). Hamaya et al. (92) only provided descriptives but not a
statistical test. Cheng et al. (109) reported no significant relationships between education
and intervention effectiveness.
Income. Four studies tested effects of income, with one study reporting significant
results. One more study reported mixed findings: In high income postal code areas,
individuals consume more fruits and vegetables, less fast food, less sugar-sweetened
beverages, but also a higher BMI (28). Two further studies reported null findings (64, 65).
Employment or occupation. May et al. (45) reported no significant relationships
with employment.
SEP composite score. Pontin et al. (83) indicated that individuals from more affluent
areas were more likely to meet physical activity guidelines.
Relationship factors
Having sick family members and sexual orientation was not studied in relation to
intervention effectiveness.
Marital or relationship status. Two studies tested for potential differences in
effectiveness based on marital or relationship status, but results were non-significant (45,
109).
Having children. One study tested the effects of having children; results were not
statistically significant (45).
Cohabitation. Living with 1-2 children in the household was positively associated
with weight loss (68).
Health-related social inequality indicators
Health insurance coverage or utilization, regular provider or primary care visits, and
disability status were not studied in relation with mobile intervention effectiveness. One study
reported that participants with a chronic condition found social features in wearables more
helpful than participants without a chronic condition (43).
Discussion
Mobile interventions can be delivered to many people at low cost, and potentially
even in remote locations. Yet, evidence is accumulating that they might not benefit all
equally, contributing to a digital health divide (117). The results of the present systematic
review of observational studies of mobile intervention uptake, engagement and effectiveness
at least partly support this claim. They point towards a divide in intervention uptake, based
on socioeconomic factors such as education and income, and also provide some support for
earlier claims that low SEP populations might benefit less from digital interventions (17). Yet,
most other findings are either heterogeneous or based on only a small number of available
studies, pointing towards important research gaps and indicating at least some uncertainty
regarding the existence of a divide, at least for exclusively mobile interventions.
Inequalities based on gender and sex
Most available studies addressed potential differences in exclusively mobile
intervention uptake, engagement, and effectiveness based on general demographic
characteristics such as gender, sex, and age. Half of the included studies on gender or sex
found that women were more likely to use mobile interventions; most others found no gender
differences. This is in line with several studies reporting greater interest in diet and health in
women (118). At the same time, it might also reflect the gender health gap, which indicates
that women spend more years in bad health than men, partly because of potential gender
biases in healthcare, where women’s health issues are sometimes overlooked or
misdiagnosed (119). The potential unsatisfactory experiences with the healthcare system
might then drive them to seek digital alternatives. Interestingly, sex and gender differences in
uptake do not necessarily translate into differences in intervention engagement. In the
present review, about half of the included studies reported gender or sex differences in
engagement, but findings were heterogeneous as to which group showed more
engagement. These findings may reflect both gender-specific needs regarding intervention
design (120, 121) as well as gender-specific barriers to intervention engagement. Especially
women in midlife frequently report increased stress levels due to having to balance work and
care responsibilities, which leads many to neglecting their own health (122). Similarly, the
majority of studies reporting significant gender or sex differences in effectiveness found that
men benefitted more than women. This is in line with findings from a recent umbrella review
(123). Indeed, men benefiting more from behavioural interventions for weight loss is a
common finding, which might be due to sex differences in body composition changes (124,
125), but also to differences in caregiving responsibilities and time available for self-care
(126). It can thus be concluded that, despite greater initial interest, women may not benefit
from exclusively mobile interventions as much as they could. Better understanding the
reasons behind gender differences in intervention uptake, engagement and effectiveness
can inform the development of more tailored interventions that better support all genders.
Inequalities based on age
A similar number of studies report an age gap in mobile intervention uptake; studies
reporting statistically significant differences mostly found younger adults to be more likely to
take up mobile interventions, likely due to their interest and familiarity with technology (127).
However, age differences could actually be due to generational rather than actual age
effects, so it could be speculated that this gap may close with time. At the same time, age
differences in mobile intervention uptake might also be rooted in stereotypes. Some
healthcare professionals, who believe that technology-based interventions might not be
suited for older individuals, may not recommend or actively discourage digital interventions
for older adults (128). This gatekeeping could potentially further contribute to the divide
(120). Interestingly, in most studies reporting statistically significant age differences, older
adults were found to engage more with exclusively mobile interventions than younger adults.
This may indicate that older adults see more need to change their behaviour to protect
against health risks (129). Evidence regarding effectiveness was again inconsistent, which
may again support the notion that older adults not benefiting from digital interventions is
rather a myth that requires debunking (123).
Inequalities based on race/ ethnicity, migration, and location
Findings regarding race and ethnicity as well as migration status were mixed. Only
about half of the included studies reported statistically significant differences and the
conclusions were inconsistent on which ethnic group (White, Black, or adults of other
ethnicities) most frequently used and engaged with mobile interventions. The lack of detailed
information on intervention content and the inclusion of a broad range of mobile interventions
make it difficult to identify specific factors contributing to the reduced uptake and
engagement in certain ethnic groups. Previous research highlighted the importance of
cultural tailoring (130). It also stresses that ethnic disparities may also be interrelated with
other inequality indicators such as income or education. However, due to the variation in the
number and type of social inequality indicators taken into account in the included studies, we
were unable to take these potential interdependencies into account.
Potential inequalities based on location were studied at two levels. First, some
studies focused on within-country differences, i.e. differences between rural and urban
users. Results were inconclusive. While digital health technologies, including mobile
interventions, are seen as a lever to improve health promotion in rural areas with limited
access to health care (131), the studies included in this review suggest that mobile
interventions may be less effective in rural areas. It is important to note that rural areas often
do not only lack healthcare providers but also opportunities for procuring healthy foods or
spontaneous physical activity, as the public transport network is often less dense (132, 133).
Without environmental changes through policy or other interventions to support these factors
(134), the effectiveness of digital interventions will naturally be limited. Second, a small
number of studies reported on between-country differences, with inconsistent results: While
uptake of wearables was higher among South Korea vs US adults (61), intervention users
from Europe and the US, i.e. the Global North, seemed to benefit more than intervention
users from Afria and Latin America, i.e. the Global South (66). More research is urgently
needed to shed light on potential between-country disparities (117); this is especially urgent
since commercial apps and wearables are typically available globally.
Inequalities based on SEP
Compared to most other inequality indicators addressed in the present review, the
evidence for a divide based on SEP was the most consistent. For uptake, education and
income seem to be most important. Indeed, although access to broadband internet and
smartphones seems to be ubiquitous, especially in industrialized countries, the divide in
access to digital technologies persists (135), even in countries such as the US or Germany
(136, 137), extending to mobile intervention use. Similarly, knowledge about the
relationships between physical activity and dietary behaviours and health and the
opportunities that mobile technology may provide for health promotion are likely correlated
with education (138). Income was also related to mobile intervention engagement, although
the results were mixed as to whether high or low-income groups were more engaged. The
results for intervention effectiveness were also inconsistent, making it unclear whether
meaningful engagement and resulting intervention effectiveness can be achieved in low SEP
populations once access barriers are addressed. A prior systematic review on digital
interventions for physical activity suggests that this may not be the case, as it found that
these interventions were only effective in high, but not low SEP populations (17). Although
an increasing number of mHealth interventions is co-developed with end-users, researchers
often struggle with recruiting diverse populations (139), and the resulting interventions
therefore might not cater to the specific needs of low SEP populations.
Relationship and health-related factors
Many social inequality indicators, including sexual orientation, household composition
and resulting care responsibilities, or health insurance coverage were rarely studied. As a
result, drawing conclusions regarding their potential influence on mobile intervention uptake,
engagement and effectiveness is difficult. Future (digital) intervention research urgently
needs to consider these factors to close this research gap and determine whether these
indicators require further attention in the development of (exclusively) mobile interventions.
Strengths and limitations
The present review summarises a total of 88 studies from 87 publications that were
identified through an extensive search that was supported by a research librarian. It thus
provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge regarding potential
social inequalities in the uptake, engagement, and effectiveness of exclusively mobile
interventions, which continue to grow in popularity (140). Complementing prior research
(e.g., Szinay et al. (20); Western et al. (17)), which often focused on randomised-controlled
trials that may also suffer from unequal participation (22, 23), this review specifically focused
on observational designs such as surveys, which often used large representative samples or
users of commercially available mobile interventions with a much broader reach. However,
the focus on observational studies rather than randomised-controlled trials (c.f., König et al.
(123); Szinay et al. (20)) limits the conclusions regarding intervention effectiveness, which
was often based on group comparisons at a single time point or, in rare cases, assessed
subjectively. Although a broad range of social inequality indicators were considered,
conclusions about many remain limited due to a small number of available studies. It is
furthermore important to note that while the quality of most of the included studies was good
or fair, we had to adjust the use of the NIH tool (27) so that it fit the purpose of the present
review. We are convinced that moving from a rating of ‘Good’, ‘Fair’ or ‘Poor’ for each
question to answering each question with ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ and splitting some of the questions
into sub-questions (i.e., 4a, 4b; 5a, 5b; 9a-c; 11a-c) has increased objectivity and
preciseness of the risk of bias assessment. However, there are a few questions that
appeared not relevant when the observational study assessed was of cross-sectional nature
(i.e., questions 6, 7, 10), when outcomes were assessed at the same time as exposure with
no external and/or formal assessor involved (question 12) or when secondary data analyses
were conducted using complete datasets (question 13). In these cases, we scored the
question as either no or not applicable, but still labelled the question as green since it
seemed unfair to label it as red while these were valid aspects associated with the chosen
study design. As such, the overall conclusion that most studies were of good or fair quality
might need to be interpreted with some caution.
Implications for practice and future research
The review found that mobile intervention uptake differs by SEP, which has important
implications for practitioners using or considering mobile interventions for health promotion.
It points to a need to thoroughly pre-check the chosen mobile intervention for factors such as
ease of use and accessibility. Collaborating closely with members of the target group in
reviewing different available mobile interventions for their usability, acceptability, and
appropriateness can help select the most suitable option for uptake. However, it cannot be
assumed that simply providing a mobile intervention to users will lead to uptake. Additional
steps might be required, such as providing supplementary (in-person) support during the
initial stages of setting up and familiarisation with the mobile intervention to enable effective
long-term use and address privacy and technical concerns (ref).
Previous research has highlighted that a variety of factors ranging from the individual
up to macro-factors affect uptake (135), with lower educational status and lower income
being associated with lower digital skills and competencies (141). To support these
populations efforts to improve digital health literacy and skills are essentials and might
benefit individuals beyond mobile health interventions.
Interestingly, many findings showed a statistical significance around the 50% mark,
highlighting the contrasting findings across uptake, engagement, and effectiveness. Given
these contrasting findings and the potential for widening existing health inequalities, future
research is urgently required. It is important that future studies are adequately powered to
detect potential subgroup differences and account for multiple comparisons in their analyses.
Conclusions
Although a wide range of factors could potentially influence the uptake, engagement
and effectiveness of exclusively mobile health interventions for weight-related behaviours
(25), the focus of most studies lies on socio-economic disparities rooted in gender/ sex, age,
SEP and, to a lesser extent, race and ethnicity. By focusing on observational studies and so
including many large-scale surveys and retrospective analyses of available data from
commercial apps, the present review identified several factors potentially linked to mobile
intervention uptake. We found that available mobile interventions are predominantly used by
younger and more affluent adults, leaving populations at risk for weight-associated
conditions such as older adults and low-SEP populations behind (142-145). Results for
engagement and effectiveness were mixed, suggesting that reducing barriers to intervention
uptake might be most promising to reduce the digital health divide. Thus, a stronger focus on
intervention uptake in other study designs, including RCTs, and systematic reviews (c.f.
(123)) and a broader range of social inequality indicators addressed are required to gain a
better understanding of who even considers using these interventions and to subsequently
design interventions specifically for disadvantaged populations to improve health for all.
