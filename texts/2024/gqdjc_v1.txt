Abstract
Following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, thousands of Ukrainian children were enrolled in
schools across European countries. In Spain, the vast majority of these children had no prior
knowledge of Spanish. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether the language barrier
can be reduced through the use of real-time transcription and speech-to-text translation
technology during classroom lessons. Two classroom activities were conducted: the reading
of a fable and the delivery of a brief lecture on neuroscience. These activities were performed
simultaneously with two groups: students fluent in Spanish (n = 23) and Ukrainian students
with no knowledge of Spanish (n = 19). Using PowerPoint365, the teacher's spoken words
were transcribed and translated into Russian in real time and projected onto a screen.
Comprehension of the fable and the lecture was assessed through content-specific
questionnaires. The Ukrainian group's scores were lower than those of the Spanish group.
However, the Ukrainian students' scores were significantly higher than those of a control
group of 13 children who completed the same test without prior exposure to the content of
the fable or the lecture. Additionally, a qualitative analysis was conducted based on the
testimonies of 4 teachers who have routinely used this method with their students. The
findings reveal that transcription and translation technology improves classroom
comprehension for Ukrainian students with no prior knowledge of Spanish under regular
classroom conditions.
Introduction
A few months after the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, more than 6 million
Ukrainians, including 665,000 students, were forced to leave their country and were
welcomed by neighboring nations (World Bank, 2022). Over 3,300 Ukrainian educational
institutions have suffered attacks since the conflict began in 2014, with 1,888 of them
occurring since the full-scale invasion (as of September 2023; Save the Children, 2023).
In Spain, according to UNESCO, just one month after the invasion began in March 2022, more
than 7,000 students were welcomed into educational institutions at various levels, 25% of
whom were in secondary education. According to the Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE,
2024), as of February 2024, the total number of enrolled Ukrainian students exceeds 38,000,
with the Valencian Community hosting the largest number by far (12,730 as of February
2024). These figures illustrate a sharp increase after the onset of the invasion, with a rapid
growth rate until September 2022 and a relative stabilization from March 2023 onwards (INE,
2024).
The linguistic landscape of Ukraine has been shaped by its complex historical context, with
both Ukrainian and Russian playing significant roles. As Besters-Dilger (2023) explains,
Ukrainian has traditionally been dominant in rural areas, while Russian prevailed in urban
centers and was the primary language of administration during the Soviet era. Following
independence in 1991, Ukrainian was established as the state language, but Russian
continued to hold a strong presence, particularly in the east and south of the country. As a
result, the Ukrainian population is often bilingual (Ivanova, 2013).
Most students who arrived in Spain did not possess knowledge of Spanish, as the primary
foreign language taught in Ukraine is English (84%; Smotrova, 2009), followed by German and
French. The homogeneous distribution of these students across public schools has led to
their frequent presence in classrooms, particularly in the Valencian Community. As a result,
schools have had to make significant efforts to integrate these students, with language
barriers being one of the most pressing challenges.
Speech-to-text technology has been the subject of educational research for over two
decades, particularly in the context of improving learning outcomes for students with
learning disabilities (Matre & Cameron, 2022; Raffoul & Jaber, 2023) and supporting second-
language acquisition (Shadiev & Liu, 2023). In recent years, this technology has significantly
improved thanks to advancements in neural networks and deep learning models (Li, 2022;
Mehrish & Majumder, 2023). Although much of this progress has been concentrated in the
English language, Spanish—due to its widespread use—has also benefitted rapidly from
these advancements.
In a previous study, Alvarez-Alonso et al. (2021) explored the benefits of dual modality,
combining auditory and visual text presentation, and found significant improvements in text
comprehension, particularly for students with lower performance in traditional language
tasks. Building on this foundation, Scott et al. (2022) demonstrated the effectiveness of
speech-to-text transcription (STT) systems in classroom settings to address auditory
discrimination challenges. Their study highlighted how the PowerPoint 365 STT system
facilitated comprehension in noisy environments and emphasized its ease of use, reinforcing
the potential of such technologies to overcome educational barriers and support diverse
learning needs.
In this context, the present study aims to evaluate how speech-to-text and automatic
translation technology (STTT) can help overcome language barriers in the classroom and
improve the educational inclusion of Ukrainian refugee students in Spain. Furthermore, it
seeks to provide evidence of its effectiveness in improving comprehension of academic
content and to gather teachers' perceptions of using this method. This work aims to
contribute to the ongoing discussion of how technology can support education in
multicultural and multilingual contexts.
Methods
Participants
The study involved 55 volunteer secondary school students, aged between 15 and 16, from
five secondary education (Educación Secundaria Obligatoria, ESO) and vocational training
(Formación Profesional, FP) schools in the province of Alicante, Spain. Of these, 19 were
Ukrainian students who had arrived in Spain following the Russian invasion of Ukraine; 23
were Spanish students, and 13 formed a mixed group of students of the same ages who did
not attend the session but completed the tests.
The Ukrainian students were selected by teachers from each school, who were familiar with
their students and could confirm that they had no prior knowledge of Spanish. This criterion
was crucial to ensure that the language barrier was present for all Ukrainian participants. The
Spanish students, on the other hand, represented a group with native-level proficiency in
Spanish.
Procedure
The classroom activity was carried out simultaneously by the Spanish and Ukrainian students
over a duration of 45 minutes and was divided into two parts, each followed by a
comprehension questionnaire to assess the content of the respective activity.
In the first part, a teacher delivered a 15-minute lecture on neuroscience. During the lecture,
the speech-to-text translation (STTT) system of PowerPoint 365 was used to display the
transcription of the teacher’s speech in Spanish, translated into Russian, on a screen. The
choice of Russian over Ukrainian was based on the fact that the STTT system is more
developed in Russian and because the participating Ukrainian students spoke Russian as
their native language. The lecture was accompanied by images related to the explained
content, but without including text, allowing students to focus on the oral content and the
projected transcription. The slides used in this activity are available in the supplementary
material.
The presentation pace was adjusted to approximately 90% of the usual speed (0.9x) due to
the slight delay of the translation system, which was dependent on internet connection
speed. Following the lecture, students completed a content-based questionnaire consisting
of 10 multiple-choice questions, available in both Spanish and Russian. Both questionnaires
were previously validated by two bilingual teachers of Ukrainian origin to ensure the quality
and accuracy of the translation. Additionally, the quality of the simultaneous translation
provided by the STTT system was evaluated as satisfactory, receiving a score of 8 out of 10
according to the feedback of a bilingual student fluent in Russian and Spanish.
The second activity consisted of the reading of a fable by the teacher. As in the neuroscience
lecture, the STTT system was used to display on the screen a transcription of the reading in
Spanish, translated into Russian. On this occasion, no visual support, such as images or
graphics, was included. Subsequently, the students completed a comprehension
questionnaire similar to the one used in the first activity. This questionnaire also consisted of
10 multiple-choice questions, available in both Spanish and Russian.
The control group, which had not attended the sessions and therefore had no prior knowledge
of the fable or the lecture, answered the same questions included in the questionnaires.
Questionnaire validation
Two experts in neuroscience and pedagogy evaluated the clarity and suitability of the
questions for the participants' educational level. The questionnaires’ Russian translations
were validated by two bilingual (Russian-Spanish) teachers to ensure their functional and
conceptual equivalence to the original Spanish versions.
The internal reliability of the questionnaires used in the Fable and Brain activities was
assessed using Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient (α). In the Fable activity questionnaire, the
initial Cronbach’s Alpha was 0.44, indicating low internal reliability. To improve this measure,
an analysis of individual items was conducted, identifying Fable Question 2 as problematic.
Upon removing this item, the Cronbach’s Alpha increased to 0.66, reaching an acceptable
level of reliability. The removal of the item was deemed reasonable because the question’s
answer was excessively obvious (see Supplementary Material). In contrast, in the Brain
questionnaire, the Cronbach’s Alpha obtained was 0.73, reflecting good internal reliability.
The questionnaires, along with the materials used for the lecture and the fable, are available
in the Supplementary Material.
Teacher Interviews
To complement the quantitative analysis, qualitative feedback was gathered from teachers
who actively participated in the implementation of the speech-to-text transcription and
translation system (STTT) in their classrooms. To ensure participant confidentiality, all
responses were collected anonymously and used exclusively for research purposes.
Teachers were asked to complete a written or audio-recorded evaluation, according to their
preference, describing their experience with the system. The responses were structured
around a series of key items designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the
system’s use, impact, and areas for improvement.
Teachers provided details regarding the frequency with which the system was used in the
classroom, the average duration of sessions, and the profile of the students who benefited,
including their age, nationality, and level of Spanish proficiency. Additionally, they described
the daily procedures for implementing the system, outlining the steps followed and the
technical conditions required for its proper operation.
Technical difficulties, such as internet connection problems, translation quality issues, or
software handling, were also analyzed, as well as other logistical or pedagogical obstacles
observed during its use. Regarding its impact, teachers evaluated the system's effects on
student learning, social integration, and emotional well-being. Finally, suggestions were
collected to optimize the experience with the system, along with practical recommendations
for other teachers who might implement it in similar contexts.
This approach allowed for the collection of information not only on the effectiveness of the
STTT system but also on its acceptance among teachers and the potential barriers to its
sustained use in the classroom.
Data analysis
Quantitative Statistical analysis
The quantitative data analysis was conducted using R software (version 4.3.2) to evaluate
differences in performance among the participating groups in the two implemented activities:
the neuroscience lecture and the fable reading. First, the means and standard deviations of
the percentage of correct responses were calculated for each group (Spanish, Russian, and
Control), based on the total scores obtained from the questionnaires administered after each
activity. To determine whether there were statistically significant differences between the
groups, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used, a non-parametric technique appropriate when the
assumptions of normality are not met.
In cases where the Kruskal-Wallis test yielded statistically significant results (p < 0.05), post-
hoc pairwise comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test, with the
Bonferroni correction applied to adjust p-values and control for Type I error due to multiple
comparisons. Additionally, the effect sizes for each group comparison were calculated using
Cliff's Delta (d). This measure is appropriate in non-parametric contexts, where comparisons
are based on ranks rather than absolute values, and it reflects the proportion of cases in
which one group outperforms another, allowing the effect size to be categorized as small,
moderate, or large.
Qualitative Design
This study employed an exploratory qualitative design to analyze the experiences,
perceptions, and recommendations of teachers who used the real-time transcription and
automatic translation system (STTT) in educational settings. First, the audio responses were
transcribed using the Online Automatic Transcription software (TAL) developed by the
University of Alicante, which utilizes Google's voice recognition technology to generate
accurate and organized transcriptions (appuad.ua.es/apps/tal). The raw transcriptions were
refined to correct punctuation errors, hesitations, or unnecessary pauses using GPT-4o with
the following prompt (in Spanish): "I will provide you with audio-to-text transcriptions of
several teachers who responded to five questions via WhatsApp audio. The transcription
contains errors that need to be interpreted and corrected (hesitations, missing punctuation,
unnecessary pauses, and incorrectly detected words that do not fit). These are typical errors
that occur in such cases. I would like you to correct these errors without changing anything
else in the text. I will send the audios one by one."
The refinement of the transcriptions was cross-checked with the original audios, and it was
observed that the cleaning process was practically flawless.
Interviewed participants
Interviews were conducted with four secondary-level teachers who regularly used the STTT
system in their classes. The participants were selected based on convenience sampling,
considering their experience with the system. The interviews were structured around five
questions that addressed the overall experience, the impact on students, challenges faced,
areas for improvement, and recommendations for other teachers. The questions were as
follows:
1. How would you describe your experience using the real-time transcription and
automatic translation system (STTT) in the classroom? Please include specific
examples of how you used it in your classes and whether it met your initial
expectations.
2. What impact have you observed on the learning and participation of Ukrainian
students when using the system? For example, did you notice improvements in their
comprehension, social integration, or motivation during the activities?
3. What have been the main technical or pedagogical difficulties you faced when
implementing the system? If there were any, how did you resolve them, or what
support do you think would have been helpful?
4. From your perspective, what aspects of the STTT system should be improved to make
it more effective in the classroom? Please include specific suggestions, both
technical and pedagogical.
5. What recommendations would you give to other teachers interested in implementing
this technology in similar contexts? Share practical advice based on your experience.
Qualitative Analysis
The transcribed interviews were processed in CSV format for further analysis. Each response
was linked to the teacher's name and the corresponding question.
The data analysis was conducted through thematic coding in the R programming
environment, using the tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, officer, and stringr packages. The steps
followed were as follows: (1) The transcriptions were structured into a tabular format with
columns including the participant's name, the question, and the response. The data were
loaded into R from a CSV file using the base package and processed with tidyverse. (2)
Preliminary codes were defined based on the research objectives, using specific keywords
identified through text manipulation functions from the stringr package. The codes identified
during the thematic analysis included the following categories: 'Impact on Learning,'
'Technical Difficulties,' 'Pedagogical Challenges,' 'Emotional Barriers,' 'Classroom Adaptation,'
and 'Strategic Recommendations.' The initial codes were proposed by ChatGPT-4o based on
a preliminary thematic analysis, which involved identifying recurring patterns and themes
within the teachers' responses to the interview questions. These codes were subsequently
reviewed, refined, and validated by 3 of the authors to ensure accuracy and alignment with
the research objectives. Thus, the codes emerged from the teachers' responses and
represent the key themes identified in the data. (3) Responses were grouped by code using
dplyr in R, enabling the identification of patterns and recurring themes in the teachers'
perceptions. (4) Bar charts were generated with ggplot2 to illustrate the frequency of
responses in each category. Additionally, the bars included representative labels, selected
from brief textual quotes extracted from the responses. (5) Functions from the officer
package were used to compile a Word document that included the visualizations, narrative
interpretations, and key quotations.
Ethical Considerations
This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Alicante,
ensuring compliance with the ethical and legal principles established for research involving
human participants. The project was evaluated under file number UA-2024-07-22_1, and its
design adhered to the Committee's guidelines, including the protection of participants' rights
and the confidential handling of their data.
All participating teachers and students were previously informed about the study's objectives
and the conditions of their participation. The voluntary nature of their collaboration was
ensured, and data anonymization was guaranteed, both for interviews and comprehension
tests. Furthermore, teachers signed an informed consent form detailing the use of the
technological tools involved and the research purpose of the data collection. This procedure
reinforces the study's commitment to ethical standards in educational research.
RESULTS
The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the real-time transcription and
translation system in the classroom to improve the comprehension of educational content by
displaced Ukrainian students in Spain with no knowledge of Spanish. To achieve this, two
educational activities were used: a neuroscience lecture and the reading of a complex story,
both followed by comprehension tests.
Quantitative Analysis of Student Performance
The comprehension analysis revealed distinct performance differences among the three
groups. The Spanish group achieved the highest average score (M = 88.26), followed by the
Russian group (M = 77.37), while the Control group scored significantly lower (M = 52.31)
Descriptive statistics of the average percentage of correct answers per group
Group Average N Standard Deviation
Control 52.31 13 16.91
Spanish 88.26 23 16.69
Russian 77.37 19 18.21
The Kruskal-Wallis test revealed statistically significant differences among the three groups
(p < 0.001). This result indicates that at least one group differs significantly from the others in
terms of the percentage of correct answers. To identify between which pairs of groups the
differences occurred, post hoc comparisons were conducted using Dunn's test with
Comparison of Group Performance in the Fable and Brain Activities Using Kruskal-Wallis
and Mann-Whitney U Tests with Bonferroni Correction
Activity Test Statistic p-value Interpretation
Fable Kruskal-Wallis 15.97 < .001 Significant differences
Fable Mann-Whitney U2 62.5 .025 Spanish > Russian
(Bonferroni)
Brain Kruskal-Wallis 6.29 .012 Significant differences
Brain Mann-Whitney U3 15.0 .025 Spanish > Russian
(Bonferroni)
To evaluate the magnitude of the differences between the Spanish and Russian groups
compared to the Control group, Cliff's Delta (d) was calculated as a measure of effect size. In
the Fable activity, the comparison between the Spanish group and the Control group yielded
an effect size of d=0.81, indicating a large effect. On the other hand, the comparison between
the Russian group and the Control group showed a moderate effect size, with d=0.40.
In the Brain activity, a similar pattern was observed, with an effect size of d=0.87 for the
comparison between the Spanish group and the Control group, confirming a large effect. For
the Russian group compared to the Control group, the effect size was also large, with d=0.73.
Overall, these results demonstrate that both the Spanish and Russian groups significantly
outperformed the Control group in both activities, with the most pronounced differences
observed in the Spanish group.
Qualitative Analysis of Teachers' Testimonials
The qualitative analysis of the interviews with teachers allowed for the identification of
several key themes reflecting their perceptions and experiences with the use of the real-time
transcription and translation system (STTT) in the classroom. These themes include: (1)
impact on learning, (2) technical and pedagogical difficulties, and (3) recommendations for
representative quotes.
1. Impact on Learning
Teachers highlighted the positive effect of the STTT system on Ukrainian students'
comprehension and integration. The system enabled students to follow lessons, even with
limited language proficiency. One teacher remarked:
"The system helped students follow the lessons even without mastering the language."
However, teachers also pointed out that not all students responded in the same way due to
emotional and contextual factors. For example:
"Some students disconnected quickly because they had more urgent concerns than learning,
but for others, it was a key tool for adapting."
This finding suggests that STTT has the potential to improve participation and learning but
requires complementary support to address students' emotional needs.
2. Technical and Pedagogical Difficulties
While the STTT system was generally well-received, teachers faced technical and
methodological challenges. Among the most frequently mentioned technical issues was
internet connectivity. One teacher commented:
"Internet connection was a constant challenge. If the system failed, the class was completely
interrupted."
On a pedagogical level, teachers mentioned that using the system required adjustments to
their teaching style. For example, one teacher explained:
"I had to speak more slowly and more clearly for the translation to be effective, which is not
always easy in the normal pace of the class."
These challenges highlight the need for reliable technical support and pedagogical training to
maximize the system's effectiveness.
3. Recommendations for Improving the System
The participants offered concrete suggestions for improving the STTT system, both from
technical and pedagogical perspectives. They stressed the importance of developing a
functionality that allows the system to operate offline. One teacher noted:
"It would be ideal if the system could work offline, especially in classrooms where
connectivity is not always guaranteed."
Additionally, they emphasized the need to integrate more dynamic visual tools to better
capture students' attention and facilitate their interaction. Expanding teacher training on the
system's use was also suggested.
Conclusion of the Qualitative Analysis
Overall, the qualitative results show that the STTT system has a positive impact on learning
and student participation, particularly in linguistically diverse contexts. However, the
identified technical and pedagogical challenges partially limit its effectiveness. The teachers'
recommendations provide a clear roadmap for improving the system and better adapting it to
classroom needs.
DISCUSIÓN
Despite the fact that voice recognition and speech-to-text technology (STT) has been
developed for some time (Klatt, 1987; McTear, 2002), only a few studies have evaluated its
usefulness in the classroom beyond the contexts of second language learning (Scott et al.,
2022) or learning disabilities (Abdollahi & Cauchard, 2023; Shadiev et al., 2024).
The present study evaluated the effectiveness of speech-to-text transcription and translation
(STTT) technology in improving the comprehension of educational content among Ukrainian
refugee students with no knowledge of Spanish. The results indicate that, although the
scores of the Ukrainian group were lower than those of the Spanish group, they were
significantly above the control level, demonstrating the positive impact of the system in
overcoming language barriers. These findings align with previous studies that highlight the
role of voice recognition technologies in facilitating learning in multilingual contexts and
second language instruction (Shadiev & Liu, 2023), as well as improving literacy among
students with learning difficulties (Matre & Cameron, 2022).
In our study, the comparison of Ukrainian and Spanish students revealed significant
differences in both activities, with the native group outperforming the Ukrainian group. This
difference, expected due to the language barrier, highlights the need to continue optimizing
technological tools to further narrow the performance gap between non-native and native
students (Shadiev & Liu, 2023). While the STTT system is effective, it cannot replace the need
for complementary pedagogical strategies or broader programs of linguistic immersion and
emotional support. In this sense, the emotional context’s impact on refugee students is
crucial, as noted in research on vulnerable populations (Save the Children, 2023).
From a qualitative perspective, teacher testimonies provide relevant complementary
insights. Teachers agreed on the system’s usefulness in fostering inclusion and student
participation, which aligns with previous studies on assistive technologies applied to
linguistically diverse contexts (Matre & Cameron, 2022). However, they also pointed out
technical challenges, such as the dependence on a stable internet connection and the need
to adjust the teaching pace to facilitate translation. These technical issues are consistent
with limitations reported in the implementation of similar tools in other studies (Li, 2022;
Mehrish & Majumder, 2023). Suggestions such as offline functionality or the integration of
more dynamic visual tools underscore the potential for improving these technologies in
practical applications.
Among the study’s main strengths is its focus on a vulnerable and hard-to-reach population,
as well as the combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses, which provide a
comprehensive view of the system’s benefits and challenges. However, the study presents
some limitations. The moderate sample size, particularly in the Ukrainian group, may limit the
generalizability of the results to other educational contexts. Additionally, the absence of a
more robust control group, though ethically justified, makes it harder to precisely determine
the magnitude of STTT’s impact compared to other interventions. These limitations could be
addressed in future research through longitudinal designs and the inclusion of comparative
groups across different educational levels and cultural contexts.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that STTT technology is an effective tool for facilitating
the comprehension of academic content among refugee students who lack proficiency in the
local language, contributing to their educational inclusion in multicultural classrooms.
However, to maximize its impact, it is necessary to enhance the system’s technical
robustness, integrate additional pedagogical resources, and provide specific training to
educators. These conclusions provide empirical evidence of the role of technology in
reducing educational barriers and pave the way for new lines of research exploring its
application in other multilingual and vulnerable contexts.
The relevance of such technological solutions becomes even more evident in the context of
the challenges faced by children and adolescents in war-affected regions. For instance, the
war in Ukraine has severely impacted the physical and mental health of Ukrainian children,
both within the country and as refugees in host nations. As highlighted by Badanta et al.
(2024), these children face numerous challenges, including disrupted access to basic health
services and significant mental health repercussions, further exacerbated by the destruction
of critical infrastructure such as schools and healthcare facilities. Addressing these barriers
requires not only immediate humanitarian responses but also long-term strategies that
incorporate innovative educational and technological tools, such as STTT systems, to foster
their inclusion, resilience, and overall well-being in multicultural educational settings.
