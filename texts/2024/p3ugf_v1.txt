Abstract
The aim of this study is to evaluate health literacy in Turkey in line with scientific studies. In this study, qualitative
research model and document analysis technique were used. The data of the study were analyzed by descriptive
content analysis, one of the types of content analysis. The problem of the study was defined as “What is the general
trend of scientific studies on health literacy in Turkey?”. The findings of the research were illustrated in accordance
with the determined purpose and given with tables and comments. In line with the determined purpose; it was
stated that the years with the highest number of studies were 2019, 2022 and 2023 with three studies each, 6
master's and 5 phd studies were prepared according to thesis types, studies were prepared to determine the health
literacy levels of teachers and university students according to the subject distribution, the universities with the
highest number of studies were Ankara and Gazi universities, quantitative research method was used more among
the research methods, studies were conducted with undergraduate and associate degree students at most, and the
most used data collection tools were scales, T-tests and descriptive statistics. Accordingly, by evaluating health
literacy in Turkey in line with scientific studies, it was determined that the general trends related to health literacy
are high. The study was concluded with recommendations.
Keywords: Descriptive Content Analysis, Education, Health Literacy, Postgraduate Study, Qualitative Research
1. Introduction
Human beings have been struggling to meet their basic needs since the moment they came into existence. Just as
eating, drinking and sleeping are the needs of humans, being healthy can also be expressed as a basic need.
Because it is not possible for an individual who is not healthy to meet his/her basic needs. In this sense, health
stands out as one of the basic needs that should be protected, cared about and worked on. People need some basic
skills to live as healthy individuals. In this respect, it can be said that health literacy, which is associated with
having health-related knowledge, skills and values, is among the important issues for individuals and society.
Therefore, this research is shaped by the evaluation of graduate studies on health literacy.
* This study was presented as an oral presentation at the International Education Congress held at Dicle University on 18-21 September 2024
Asian Institute of Research Education Quarterly Reviews Vol.7, No.4, 2024
To start with the definition of the basic concepts, the Turkish Language Association Dictionary (2024) defines the
word health as “The state of complete physical, social and spiritual well-being of the individual, well-being of the
health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or
infirmity” (WHO, 2024). Literacy is basically a concept related to reading, writing, education, teaching, skills and
speaking ability. In this sense, functional health literacy can be defined as the ability to read and understand health-
related information and adapt to changing health conditions (Andrus & Roth, 2002; Norris & Philiphs, 2003;
Speros, 2005; Koçoğlu et al., 2021). Being functionally literate is recognized as the basis for all kinds of success,
both in school and in life. Being literate not only contributes to personal development or personal learning but also
to being successful in school and in life (Rintaningrum, 2009). In this sense, it is important that the competencies
related to literacy are acquired primarily by teachers (Koçoğlu, 2021 a; Koçoğlu, 2021 b), who are individuals
who think, produce and criticize as managers of the learning environment, and all other educational stakeholders.
The idea of redefining literacy as a social practice is quite new. In the first half of the twentieth century, a form of
literacy-based largely on oral expression and printed texts was considered sufficient as a skill and practice
approach. However, the concept of multiple literacies, introduced by Cope and Kalantzis in 2000, emerged with a
measure that recognizes the influence of social and cultural contexts on different types of texts (Barton & Lennon,
2020). Thus, literacies started to emerge with their different types. It can be stated that health literacy emerged due
to this diversification.
Technology plays an important role in human life in terms of meeting needs and making life easier. The increase
in the use of technology day by day has harmful aspects as well as benefits (Koçoğlu et al., 2022). In recent years,
the increase in the rate of seeking treatment over the internet, especially regarding health problems, the difficulty
in accessing accurate information about health due to digital pollution, and the increase in health problems caused
by digitalization have led to the emergence of the concept of health literacy as a necessity. With increasing
digitalization, it is seen that excessive repetitive online health research related to health anxiety or distress has
caused an intensity in studies on many disorders, especially cyberchondria. Therefore, it has been understood that
individuals should critically analyze their health-related knowledge and be equipped by balancing the use of
technology in a healthy way. This situation further increases the importance given to the concept of health literacy
(Aydemir & Yaşar, 2023; Ekinci et al., 2021; Starcevic, 2017; Starcevic et al., 2020).
One of the first conditions for a person to lead a quality, productive, prosperous and happy life is to be a healthy
individual. Therefore, health is an important human capital that needs to be cared and protected, and it has led to
the emergence of the concept of health literacy by meeting with a certain knowledge, experience and interest (Avcu
& Dal Biçer, 2024). In this sense, the concept of “health literacy” first appeared in the study titled “Health Literacy
as social policy” prepared by Scott K. Simonds in 1974 (Aktaş, 2018; Simonds, 1974). However, the widespread
use of the concept came after the “National Assessment of Adult Literacy” (NAAL) study conducted in the United
States in 2003. Health literacy is a concept that still attracts the attention of many researchers and increases its
importance day by day (Balçık et al., 2014; Uruç Öztürk, 2018). In this direction, health literacy aims to create
health awareness in the society by providing adults with the ability to make the right decisions about their own
health in order to protect and maintain health. The concept of health literacy has evolved from a history of
identifying, redefining and quantifying the functional literacy needs of the adult population (Berkman et al., 2010;
Kalaycı Oflaz, 2023; Kickbusch et al., 2005; Nutbeam & Kickbusch, 1998). Health literacy is related to reading
and understanding health-related information, making appropriate decisions and sharing responsibilities by using
that information (Osborne, 2012; Weiss, 2003). Health services inherently affect health outcomes through
activities carried out at three main points: transportation, self-care, and interaction between the health care team
and the patient (Yılmaz & Tiraki, 2016). It can be stated that by improving health literacy and services, results will
be obtained in the desired direction (Ali et al., 2024). Therefore, those who master these three points are expected
to reach a level that can protect their health as health literates.
Health literacy is shaped by three basic skills such as health care, disease prevention and health promotion (Ulu
Kalın, 2021). In this sense, failure to develop health literacy skills leads to some negative consequences. These
include poor health status, lack of knowledge about medical care and conditions, decreased understanding of
Asian Institute of Research Education Quarterly Reviews Vol.7, No.4, 2024
medical information, lack of understanding and use of preventive services, poor perception of personal health
status, low compliance rates, increased hospitalizations and increased health care costs. Medical communities need
to acknowledge these problems and develop strategies to overcome the barriers that limit patients' ability to
adequately navigate the health care environment (Andrus & Roth, 2002). Otherwise, in addition to increased costs,
societal health is likely to suffer. As a matter of fact, taking preventive measures in health can contribute more to
reducing health costs and protecting public health (Palumbo, 2017).
Although there are many studies on this research in Turkey (Akyüz, 2021; Alp & Mete, 2023; Çelik & Kuçlu,
2022; Ekinci et al., 2021; Koç Akran, 2021; Kurtulmuş & Ilgın, 2024; Şantaş, 2021; Turan et al., 2023) and in the
international literature (Huy, 2022; Kondilis et al., 2008; Paucar-Caceres et al. 2023; Tabak et al., 2023; Tavousi
et al., 2022; Qi et al., 2021), any study on the subject wasn’t found up-to-date and only in the field of education.
In this respect, it is thought that this study is important and will contribute to literature.
The general aim of this study is to evaluate health literacy in Turkey in line with scientific studies. In this direction,
the main problem of the research was determined as “What is the general trend of scientific studies on health
literacy in Turkey?”. In line with the stated purpose and importance, answers to the following sub-objectives were
sought;
1. What is the distribution of postgraduate studies on health literacy in the field of education according to
years?
2. What is the distribution of postgraduate studies on health literacy in the field of education according to
their types?
3. How is the distribution of postgraduate studies on health literacy in the field of education according to
the subjects?
4. What is the distribution of postgraduate studies on health literacy in the field of education according to
universities?
5. What are the research methods used in graduate studies on health literacy in the field of education?
6. With which study group or participants were the postgraduate studies on health literacy in the field of
education conducted?
7. What is the distribution of postgraduate studies on health literacy in the field of education according to
data collection tools?

data analysis methods?
9. What is the distribution of postgraduate studies on health literacy in the field of education according to
data analysis methods?
2. Method
This section includes four subheadings: the research model, the scope of the research, the data collection tool, the
data collection process and the analysis of the data.
2.1. Research Model
In this study, qualitative research model and document analysis technique were used. Qualitative research can be
defined as a research method in which meaning and understanding are concentrated, the researcher is the main
tool, rich descriptions are made, and an inductive process is followed (Merriam, 2018). Qualitative research aims
to answer questions related to understanding the dimensions of meaning and experiences of people's lives and
social worlds. Central to good qualitative research is whether researchers illuminate subjective meanings, actions
and social contexts as they understand them (Fossey et al., 2002). Besides, in qualitative research, there is an effort
to reach a deep understanding of the subject matter. In this respect, the researcher acts like an explorer, traces the
reality with additional questions and attaches importance to the subjective perspective of the interlocutor (Karataş,
2015).
Asian Institute of Research Education Quarterly Reviews Vol.7, No.4, 2024
Document review technique is a technique related to obtaining, reviewing, questioning and analyzing various
documents, which are considered as primary or secondary sources that constitute the data set of the research.
Document review is a systematic process of examining or evaluating both printed and electronic materials.
Documentary materials in various forms such as meeting minutes, guides, books, diaries, journals, magazines,
letters, newspapers, radio and tv program scripts, corporate reports, survey data, various public records,
sketchbooks and photo albums can be used for systematic evaluation (Bowen, 2009). In this sense, it can be stated
that any written document or source can be analyzed through document analysis.
2.2. Scope of the Study
This study will examine the general trends of health literacy in Turkey in line with scientific studies. The
theoretical population of the study consists of 11 postgraduate theses published in Turkey between 2015 and 2023
on health literacy only in the field of education. All of the theses included in the scope of the study consisted of
studies published as open access in the database of YÖK National Thesis Center until August 12, 2024. The names
of the theses, the years they were published in and by whom they were written are presented in Appendix 1.
2.3. Data Collection Instrument and Procedure
As stated before, the aim of this study is to evaluate the postgraduate studies on health literacy in the field of
education in Turkey according to different criteria. For this purpose, the keyword “health literacy” was searched
in the database of YÖK National Thesis Center. Theses were examined in detail and 11 postgraduate studies on
health literacy were identified only in the field of education. The specified studies were first downloaded to the
computer and a thesis list was created. On 12.08.2024, when the scanning was made, 11 postgraduate studies on
health literacy prepared only in the field of education were examined in the system in accordance with the
predetermined criteria. After the examinations, the necessary data were collected through the publication
classification form developed by Çiltaş et al. (2012) and adapted to this study. In this direction, evaluations were
made by determining the years, thesis types, subjects, universities, methods, participants/study group, data
collection tools, data analysis methods and results of the specified postgraduate studies. The data obtained were
tabulated and presented in the findings section with comments.
2.4. Data Analysis
Document analysis is categorized into three groups: meta-analysis, meta-synthesis and descriptive content
analysis. Descriptive content analysis was used in this study. Descriptive content analysis can be defined as a
systematic study that involves determining the trends and evaluating the research results in a descriptive dimension
by considering the studies conducted on a specific subject (Çalık & Sözbilir, 2014). In this study, the trends in the
literature were tried to be determined as postgraduate studies on health literacy in the literature were analyzed in
line with the criteria previously determined by the researcher.
3. Findings
In this section, the findings obtained for the research questions are analyzed in order. The data obtained are
presented in tables with their interpretations below.
3.1. Distribution of Studies by Year

study on health literacy in the field of education was prepared in 2015. The years with the highest number of
studies were 2019, 2022 and 2023, with 3 studies each, and the years with the lowest number of studies were
2015 and 2020. Looking at the rate of preparation of the studies, it is seen that there is a significant growing trend
in the studies prepared after 2019. However, it can be said that the number of studies prepared on the subject is
not yet at the desired rate.
3.2. Distribution of Studies According to Thesis Types

seen that a total of 11 graduate studies were prepared. It was determined that 6 of these studies were prepared at
master's level and 5 of them were prepared at phd level. It can be stated that the results are close to each other
and the graduate studies are almost at the same level. In another aspect, it can be stated as a remarkable result
that phd studies are at a close level with master's studies.

it was determined that the studies aimed at determining the health literacy levels of university students (f-3) and
the studies aimed at determining the health literacy levels of teachers and teacher candidates (f-3) stand out in
terms of subject matter. In addition, it was seen that there are studies prepared on different topics such as health
literacy in textbooks, e-health literacy skills of chronic patients, support of artificial intelligence to health literacy
and gamified health literacy education. In this direction, it was determined that postgraduate studies on health
literacy are concentrated on educational stakeholders such as teachers, preservice teachers, students and
textbooks.

studies were conducted were examined; it was seen that a total of 11 studies were prepared in 9 different
universities. In this sense, there was a diversity in the number of universities. In addition, the fact that the studies
were generally prepared in universities in big cities can be stated as another remarkable result. When the findings
were examined, the universities where the most studies were prepared were Ankara and Gazi universities with 2
studies each. Apart from this, it was determined that Atatürk, Burdur Mehmet Akif Ersoy, Fırat, Hacettepe, Isparta
Applied Sciences, Istanbul and Marmara universities prepared 1 study each. Considering the existence of more
than 200 universities in Turkey, it can be said that the number of universities where studies were conducted is
quite insufficient.

it was determined that there were 7 quantitative, 3 mixed and 1 qualitative studies. Accordingly, it was seen that
quantitative method was the most used method (f-7) in the studies. The number of studies prepared with mixed
methods (f-3) was also significant. Studies prepared with qualitative method (f-1) were prepared at the lowest
level. In this direction, it was determined that quantitative and mixed methods were mostly used in studies on
health literacy, while qualitative methods were not yet at the desired level. It can be said that this situation was
because the subject of health literacy requires multi-participant studies.

was determined that most of the studies were conducted with undergraduate and associate degree students. The
number of studies prepared with secondary and high school students, teachers and teacher candidates was also
significant and at a considerable level. In addition to these, there were studies conducted by physicians specialized
in different fields, chronic patients, teachers and students, and adults over the age of 18. One of the noteworthy
issues in this direction was the diversity of participants or study groups, and the other was that not only education
stakeholders but also health stakeholders were included in the studies. The reason for this may be that a broad field
selected from the fields of health and education was chosen as the study area.

on health literacy. Accordingly, it was determined that the most used data collection instruments were scales (f-
6), some of which consisted of questionnaires without validity and reliability, for different subjects in quantitative
studies. In the mixed-method studies, it was determined that instruments such as interview forms, open-ended
questions for case study activities and rubrics were used together with scales and questionnaires, some of which
consisted of questionnaires without validity and reliability. Finally, in a qualitative study, a semi-structured
interview form was used as a data collection tool. In this direction, it was understood that data collection
instruments such as scales and questionnaires were generally used in quantitative studies.

content analysis technique was used in the only qualitative study of the research. In addition, in quantitative
studies, data analysis methods such as descriptive statistics (f-4) (frequency, percentage, standard score,
arithmetic mean, standard deviation, number and grade level) and Cronbach's Alpha (f-3) were used to a
significant extent.
3.9. Results of the Studies
The findings related to the results of postgraduate studies on health literacy in the field of education are shown in
Code of the Results of the Studies
Studies
S-1 According to the results obtained from the research, it was determined that the majority of the
students had low levels of health literacy, while their attitudes towards health issues were
positive. It was observed that biology textbooks and curricula didn’t contain sufficient
information to increase health literacy.
S-2 According to the data obtained from the study, it was determined that pre-service science
teachers were aware of the relationship between nutrition and health and therefore act
consciously regarding the use of medication. In addition, it was determined that pre-service
teachers had high levels of awareness about utilizing health services, were aware of the
importance of first aid for human life, and that the science course would provide a positive
contribution to the development of health literacy.
S-3 According to the quantitative findings obtained from the research, the health literacy status of
secondary school students was generally found to be at a high level. When the results obtained
from the interviews conducted with secondary school students in the research were examined,
it was seen that the students' awareness of health literacy was high and the quantitative
findings were supported.
Asian Institute of Research Education Quarterly Reviews Vol.7, No.4, 2024
S-4 According to the findings of the study, health behaviors of health technician students were
found to be determinant in health literacy scores and health literacy level.
S-5 As a result of the study, it was determined that university students had sufficient level of health
literacy knowledge. It was concluded that women participating in the study were more
knowledgeable than men. It was determined that students who followed innovations in the
field of health had higher health literacy levels than students who didn’t follow innovations.
S-6 According to the results obtained from this study, it was found that the health literacy levels
of the students were at an adequate level. However, based on the education program and grade
levels, it was revealed that social work education didn’t create a statistically significant
difference in the health literacy levels of students in the processes of accessing, understanding,
evaluating and using information. In addition, it was determined that there was no statistically
significant difference in the treatment, service, disease prevention and health promotion
dimensions of health literacy according to the education program and grade levels.
S-7 When the qualitative data of the study were analyzed, it was concluded that health education
supported by case studies was more effective in increasing the health knowledge of secondary
school students. However, it was observed that the health education supported by case studies
didn’t make a significant difference in the health literacy levels of the students compared to
the students who received health topics education with the current program. By analyzing the
quantitative data of the study, it was determined that students were familiar with epidemic
diseases, epidemic-related science concepts, ways of spreading diseases, measures to be taken
to prevent transmission in case of an epidemic and developed positive attitudes towards
epidemic-related hygiene and nutrition habits, and epidemic-related ethical and empathic
views.
S-8 Internet and different social media use was found to be an important factor on e-health literacy
skills. Thanks to the use of digital technologies, chronic patients can access health information
more accurately. However, mobile health text message training can be used as an educational
tool to increase patients' awareness of healthy living and to direct patients to more accurate
health information.
S-9 The physicians participating in the study found ChatGPT reliable in terms of providing
accurate information. The level of the above “risk of producing erroneous information” can
be determined by using ChatGPT more frequently. While ChatGPT was considered as a tool
to support health literacy, its functional use depends on increasing health literacy.
S-10 When the correlation analysis results were examined in this study, it was determined that there
were significant positive relationships between all dimensions. There was a significant
difference in terms of age, gender and whether the participants were vaccinated against
COVID-19; however, there was no significant difference in terms of marital status,
professional experience, education level and the institution where they worked. In line with
the results of the study, it was recommended to conduct a comprehensive study involving
other professional groups and to inform the public and students about health literacy through
cooperation and protocols with the Ministry of National Education and stakeholder
institutions due to the high level of knowledge of teachers about health literacy.
S-11 Statistical analysis showed that there was a significant difference between the pre- and post-
test scores of the users (p<0.05). Furthermore, the analysis of the post-test results revealed
significant differences between participants of different educational and age groups. Finally,
the analysis shows that there is a negative relationship between users' post-test scores and their
body mass index. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the gaps in the
literature on health literacy and gamification.
According to the results obtained from the studies, it was concluded that the health literacy levels of secondary
school, associate and undergraduate students, adult chronic patients and other participants were generally high (f-
8). In addition, it can be stated that health literacy levels have increased with the development of digital
technologies and health literacy training has increased health literacy skills. Finally, in the findings of quantitative
studies in which different dimensions were examined, there were studies supporting the high level of health
literacy, while there were some studies that didn’t support it.

4. Discussion and Conclusion
The concept of health refers to an individual's physical, mental and social well-being. To have a healthy life, it is
expected to reach a certain level of awareness. In this sense, becoming a health literate individual is realized
through the correct use of certain knowledge, skills and abilities. Hence, it can be stated that it is important for
individuals and society to develop health awareness by undergoing certain health-related training.
The results obtained from this research are remarkable. The results obtained contain important clues about health
literacy in the field of education. According to the findings obtained in this direction; the years in which the most
studies were prepared were 2019, 2022 and 2023 with three studies each; according to the types of theses, master's
theses were prepared more; when the distribution of the studies according to the subjects of the studies was
examined, it was determined that most studies were prepared to determine the health literacy levels of teachers,
teacher candidates and university students; when the distribution of the studies according to universities was
examined, it was determined that two studies were prepared in Ankara and Gazi universities and one study was
prepared in other universities. Among the research methods used in the studies, quantitative research method was
used more; when the findings related to the participants/study group of the studies were examined, it was
determined that there were mostly studies conducted with undergraduate and associate degree students; the most
commonly used data collection tools in the studies were scales consisting of questionnaires, some of which were
not validated and reliable for different subjects in quantitative studies; when the findings related to the data
analysis methods used in the studies were examined, it was determined that T-test and descriptive statistics were
mostly used in quantitative studies. Furthermore, when the results obtained from the studies were examined, it
was seen that the health literacy level and awareness of students from different levels and other participants were
at a high level. According to these results, it can be stated that the participants had sufficient knowledge, skills
and equipment to understand what they read about health and apply them correctly to their lives.
In the study prepared by Turan et al. (2023), it was found that the issue of health literacy attracted the most
attention in 2022 as of 2011 and that studies in the field of nursing were concentrated; In the study conducted by
Paucar-Caceres et al. (2023), it is determined that the interest in health literacy among scientists has gradually
increased and the number of publications has increased significantly especially in the last five years. This finding
is similar to the results of this study. In this study, the number of master's and doctoral theses were close to each
other; in Alp & Mete's (2023) study, the number of studies at master's thesis level was almost five times the
number of studies at doctoral thesis level; in Kurtulmuş & Ilgın's (2024) study, although there were 19 master's
theses, there were no studies at doctoral level. Doctoral level and similar to the results of this study, it was
determined that the number of studies with qualitative design was insufficient. According to the types of theses,
it was seen that the number of studies on health literacy in the master's degree type is high. In this study, while
the number of studies on determining the health literacy levels of teachers and students was high; in the study
conducted by Koç Akran (2021), it was understood that the most emphasized concepts were concepts such as
“information search”, “information interpretation” and “health awareness”. Finally, according to the results
obtained from this study, although it was determined that the health literacy level of the participants was high, it
was seen that the health literacy level of the participants was insufficient in the study conducted by Andrus &
Roth (2002). As a result, it was determined that the level of health literacy in postgraduate studies prepared in
the field of education related to health literacy in Turkey is high and there is a general increasing trend in the
number of studies on the subject. It can be stated that the use of digital technology increases the level of awareness,
and the training provided by different individuals, institutions and organizations for health literacy are effective
in this sense. However, it can still be stated that the number of studies on health literacy in the field of education
is not sufficient and further studies should be conducted on the subject.
In this direction, the following suggestions can be made;
➢ Qualitative studies can be featured more by increasing the number of theoretical or applied studies on
the subject at different educational levels related to the field of education.
➢ Meta-analysis or descriptive content analysis studies with wider participation in terms of subject and
scope can be conducted.
➢ Elective health literacy courses to be taught at different levels of education can be added to curricula

or integrated into courses by associating them with daily life.
➢ Considering that the entire society passes through educational institutions in one way or another, it
may be useful to organize informative meetings, conferences, panels and symposiums to increase
health literacy skills.
➢ To spread preventive health measures, programs and advertisements can be created and presented to
the public through digital platforms.
