Abstract
Emotion regulation plays a crucial role in psychological well-being, particularly during times
of stress. While intrinsic emotion regulation has been extensively studied, the dynamics of
extrinsic emotion regulation (EER) - the process of regulating others' emotions - across various
stress contexts remains underexplored. This study investigated the influence of situational
factors on EER strategies during routine and high stress periods. Two experiments were
conducted, one during routine times (n = 51) and another three months into the Israel-Hamas
war that started on October 7, 2023 (n = 90). Participants engaged in an EER task involving
daily life (routine time) or war-related (stress time) scenarios that varied in emotional intensity
and controllability. They provided supportive messages in writing to the hypothetical
individuals and reported their use of reappraisal and distraction strategies. The results revealed
that engaging in EER improved both positive and negative affect in both contexts. Notably,
distraction use was significantly higher during stress time compared to routine time, whereas
reappraisal use did not differ between the two samples. During routine times, reappraisal was
used more in low-intensity, uncontrollable situations, while distraction use was not
significantly influenced by situational factors. During stress, reappraisal use was influenced by
controllability regardless of intensity, while distraction was used more in controllable
situations, particularly those of low intensity. These findings highlight the complex dynamics
of EER strategy selection across stressful and non-stressful periods, and underscore the
importance of considering situational factors in understanding extrinsic emotion regulation
processes. This study brakes new grounds by showing, for the first time, how interactions
between situational and contextual factors influence support provision, with implications for
developing targeted interventions to enhance emotional resilience in both everyday and high-
stress environments.

Introduction
The adverse mental health effects of war are well-established (Jain et al., 2022). War
and conflict are particularly potent sources of stress, exposing individuals to prolonged periods
of threat and uncertainty (Hobfoll et al. 2007). Stress is an internal condition involving
physiological, neural, and emotional reactions (Mason, 1975). These reactions may be
triggered by internal (e.g., intrusive memories) or external (e.g., the sound of sirens in a conflict
zone) stimuli or events that are perceived as potentially harmful or threatening. The Israel-
Hamas war, which started on October 7, 2023, resulted in heightened stress levels among the
Israeli population (Enav et al., 2025; Levi-Belz et al., 2024). When facing stressful events,
individuals actively attempt to change their emotional responses through emotion regulation
(Gross & Thompson, 2007). Indeed, emotion regulation has emerged as a prominent protective
factor against the maladaptive effects of stress (Troy & Mauss, 2011). Struggling with emotion
regulation or using less effective or maladaptive ER strategies can lead to psychological
problems, such as depression and anxiety disorders, especially in times of stress (Aldao et al.,
2010a; Garnefski et al., 2002). While the role of intrinsic emotion regulation (IER); regulating
one's own emotions, in shielding against stress has been extensively explored (Bonanno, 2004;
Bonanno et al., 2011; Bonanno & Burton, 2013), recent indications suggest that extrinsic
emotion regulation (EER); regulating another person's emotions (Nozaki & Mikolajczak,
2020), may also serve as a protective factor. However, there is a lack of empirical data on the
role of EER during stressful times as well as the situational factors that influence EER use.
EER is defined as a set of actions aimed at influencing another person’s emotional
trajectory (Nozaki & Mikolajczak, 2020). Using appropriate emotion regulation strategies to
regulate others’ emotions is key to the psychological well-being of both the emotion regulation
provider and recipient (Morelli et al., 2015). Recent research has proposed that EER strategy
use is influenced by individual differences, such as depression symptoms ( Massarwe & Cohen,
2023, 2024; for a similar model in IER see Doré et al., 2016), and situational factors, such as
emotional intensity (Matthews et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2024) and controllability (Wenzel et al.,
2020). Although these factors have been extensively studied in IER, empirical evidence of their
influence on EER use remains limited. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap by
investigating the situational factors that impact the effectiveness of EER during routine and
stressful times. We specifically focused on two of the most common emotion regulation
strategies: reappraisal and distraction.
Reappraisal is an emotion regulation strategy in which individuals reframe how they
think about an emotional event in order to change their feelings (Gross, 1998) and has shown
numerous benefits for emotional, social, cognitive, and physiological outcomes (for review,
see Aldao et al., 2010; Webb et al., 2012). Habitual intrinsic use of reappraisal is commonly
associated with fewer depression symptoms (Cutuli, 2014; Garnefski et al., 2002; Roos, 2021),
as well as a greater experience of overall positive emotions and less experience of negative
emotions (Gross & John, 2003), including in response to daily stressors (Johnson et al., 2016).
Distraction, however, involves shifting attention from particular aspects of emotional stimuli
(Shechner et al., 2017). Distraction is mostly effective when dealing with high-intensity
emotional stimuli or when cognitive resources are limited (Sheppes et al., 2011; Sheppes &
Meiran, 2007). It is relatively simple to implement as the generation of neutral thoughts in
distraction is independent and does not conflict with the original emotional information
(Sheppes et al., 2014). Moreover, distraction blocks emotional information at an early stage
before it gathers force, allowing the individual to successfully regulate high-intensity emotional
information (Gross, 1998; Sheppes et al., 2014). This characteristic makes distraction
particularly effective in acute stress situations, where immediate relief is needed. However,
while distraction may be successful in immediate, high-stress conditions due to its ease of
implementation, it may have long-term costs. Distraction may be less beneficial and adaptive
in the long term, as it may disrupt the processing, evaluation, and remembering of emotional
information (Wilson & Gilbert, 2008). Therefore, while reappraisal may initially require more
cognitive resources than distractions, its use often leads to more sustainable outcomes for
emotional well-being (Sheppes, 2020a).
The use of reappraisal and distraction may be dependent on situational factors such as
the intensity of the situation and whether it is controllable or not (Matthews et al., 2021; Troy
et al., 2013). While prior investigations have shown the effects of these factors on the use and
success of intrinsic emotion regulation strategies, there is very little data regarding their effects
on the use of EER strategies. To our knowledge, only one study has examined the role of
intensity in EER. This study, by Matthews et al. (2021), found that when others observe low-
intensity images, people tend to help them reappraise their responses; however, when others
face high-intensity images, people tend to help them using distraction. These results replicate
the results obtained in IER studies (Sheppes et al., 2011, 2014) and suggest that in high-
intensity situations, individuals do not have the cognitive capacity to employ reappraisal and,
therefore, turn to distraction (Sheppes, 2020a). Regarding controllability, while no studies have
assessed its role in predicting the tendency to use reappraisal or distraction to help others,
several studies have demonstrated that controllability plays a significant role in the
effectiveness of EER, particularly when using reappraisal. For example, EER using reappraisal
has been found to be more effective in uncontrollable versus controllable situations (Wenzel et
al., 2020), replicating previous findings on IER (Cheng, 2001; Haines et al., 2016; Troy et al.,
2013). Reappraisal may not be helpful in controlled situations (Troy et al., 2013), possibly
because it dampens emotions that could motivate effective action (Tamir, 2016). One study that
assessed the link between controllability and intrinsic reappraisal use (not strategy success)
indicated that participants who reported relatively high levels of well-being used reappraisal
more when they perceived situations as less controllable than when they perceived situations
as more controllable (Haines et al., 2016). However, this study examined IER; therefore, no
information exists regarding the role of controllability in the tendency to use reappraisal during
EER. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the effect of controllability on distraction use and
effectiveness has not yet been studied. Importantly, no studies till date examined the interaction
between intensity and controllability in EER use.
As mentioned above, in addition to situational factors, such as intensity and
controllability, EER use can be affected by other factors, such as stress (Blanke et al., 2021;
Bonanno & Burton, 2013; Le et al., 2018). Studies on IER have shown that stress significantly
affects both the use and success of emotion regulation strategies (Raio et al., 2013). Acute stress
leads to an increased use of maladaptive strategies, such as rumination and self-blame, while
also reducing the use of adaptive strategies, such as reappraisal (Miklósi et al., 2014). Stress
also appears to impair the effectiveness of distraction as an emotion-regulation technique
(Kinner et al., 2014; Langer et al., 2021). However, there is almost no information regarding
the effect of stress on the use of EER strategies. Importantly, during times of acute stress,
individuals may lack cognitive resources to regulate their own emotions (Raio & Phelps, 2015).
In such situations, helping someone else regulate their emotions may be easier and more
beneficial (Guendelman et al., 2022). Indeed, EER has been shown to have numerous benefits
for providers, including improved mood, reduced stress (Morelli et al., 2015; Mongrain et al.,
2018), increased happiness, and reduced depression (Arbel et al., 2020, 2022; Doré et al., 2017;
Massarwe & Cohen, 2023; Morris et al., 2015). These findings corroborate data from the
COVID-19 pandemic, a relatively stressful period, which shows that helping others during the
lockdown imposed due to the pandemic using reappraisal reduced psychological distress
among support providers (Arbel et al., 2022).
The current study aimed to fill the gap in our understanding of how situational
(intensity, controllability) and contextual (stressful, routine periods) factors influence EER use,
focusing on reappraisal and distraction. For this purpose, similar to prior studies (Arbel et al.,
2022; Massarwe & Cohen, 2024), participants completed an EER task in which they wrote
supportive letters in response to eight scenarios that systematically varied in emotional
intensity (high/low) and controllability (controllable/uncontrollable) and reported their use of
reappraisal and distraction strategies. We expected to replicate prior findings showing that EER
improves mood, even at times of high stress, as evidenced by the similar effects observed
during the COVID-19 pandemic (Arbel et al., 2022). Regarding strategy use, based on findings
from the IER literature (Raio et al., 2013), we predicted more distraction use than reappraisal
during times of high stress. Furthermore, we predicted that participants would use reappraisal
more in low-intensity versus high-intensity situations (Matthews et al., 2021; Sheppes et al.,
2011, 2014), as well as in low-controllability versus high-controllability situations (Ford &
Troy, 2019; Troy et al., 2013). Regarding distraction, we predicted that participants would use
it more in high-intensity versus low-intensity situations (Matthews et al., 2021). As no prior
studies have assessed the role of controllability in distraction use, we did not have specific
predictions regarding the effect of controllability on distraction.
Transparency and Openness
We report on how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions, and all measures in the
Data were analyzed using R version 4.3.2. The study design and analyses were not pre-
registered.
Experiment 1
Method
Participants
A power analysis using G*Power (Faul et al., 2007) was conducted to ensure adequate
statistical power. To detect within-between variable interactions with a medium effect size
(partial eta squared = 0.06) in the multilevel regression analyses, with a priori alpha set at 0.05
and desired power greater than 80%, it was determined that a minimum of 50 participants were
required. Experiment 1, therefore, included 57 participants. Participants completed the
experiment approximately eight months prior to the Israel-Hamas war (from January to May
2023). One participant was excluded because of low motivation to regulate others' emotions
(mean ratings of motivation were less than 2 on a 1-5 scale; see also Massarwe & Cohen, 2024),
and five participants were excluded for not following the task instructions. The final sample
consisted of 51 participants (mean age = 26.3 years, SD = 3.51, 52.94% female; for more
Procedure and Materials
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Education,
University of Haifa, Israel (365/20). The experiment was conducted online via the Qualtrics
survey platform with instructions provided by email. The participants provided their consent
before beginning the study. The study consisted of an extrinsic emotion regulation (EER) task,
followed by self-report questionnaires. Upon completion, participants received a modest
payment worth approximately $10 or a gift card or course credit.
The EER Task
The EER task is based on similar tasks (Arbel et al., 2022; Massarwe & Cohen, 2024). It
included eight texts describing negative emotional scenarios. In order to enhance participants’
engagement, they were told that their letters may be sent to the person who wrote the event.
The events, however, were written by the experimenters. The researchers created the scenarios
to vary in both emotional intensity and perceived controllability, resulting in a 2X2 design (high
vs. low intensity; controllable vs. uncontrollable). The task therefore included four text
categories, each with two scenarios. The order of scenario presentation was randomized
between the participants.
Examples of scenarios:
1. High emotional intensity and controllable situations (e.g., a student feeling extremely
lonely at the university, but does not make sincere efforts to build social connections).
2. Low emotional intensity and uncontrollable situations (e.g., a student facing financial
stress due to the war's impact on income and educational costs).
3. High emotional intensity and uncontrollable situations (e.g., a woman who feels
extremely sad due to a stillbirth).
4. Low emotional intensity and controllable situations (e.g., a person who compulsively
consumes war-related news despite recognizing its negative impact on daily
functioning).
To validate the perceived intensity and controllability of the events, participants were asked
to rate each event on its perceived intensity ("How much do you think the other person feels
bad about the situation?") and controllability ("How much do you think the other person
controlled the situation?"). They also rated their positive ("How good do you feel?") and
negative feelings ("How bad do you feel?"). Following these ratings, the participants were
asked to write a supportive letter to the other person. They then reported their negative and
positive feelings as well as the degree to which they used reappraisal, distraction, and other
EER strategies using two items per strategy. In the current paper we focus on reappraisal and
distraction. All ratings were made on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much), in addition to
the ratings of strategy use, which were done on a scale from 1 (very little) to 7 (very much).
Questionnaires
Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). In order to assess psychological distress during the
study, participants completed the DASS questionnaire. The DASS-21 is a self-report
questionnaire containing 21 items measuring the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress
(Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). Higher levels indicate greater distress. Participants were asked
to rate how often they experienced each item in the past two weeks using a four-point scale
ranging from 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much or most of the time).
We calculated participants' global distress as a composite score based on the three scales. The
Omega reliability index for DASS scores was = 0.950.
Demographic Questionnaire. The demographic questionnaire comprised questions about the
participants' age, ethnicity, marital status, educational background, and current or previous
questionnaires, which will not be discussed in the current paper.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were carried out using R Studio (version 4.3.2). To investigate the effect of
EER on positive and negative affect, we employed linear mixed-effects regression models
using the "lmer" function. Separate models were fitted for positive and negative affect,
including time (before vs. after support), with a random intercept for participant number.
The differences in EER strategies were examined using a general linear mixed-effects
model (GLMM) implemented with the "glmer" function from the "lme4" package (Bates et al.,
2015). The model investigated the effects of situational factors (intensity and controllability)
on the use of reappraisal and distraction strategies, with participant numbers included as a
random intercept. Specifically, multilevel regression analyses were performed to explore the
effect of situational factors on strategy use, separately for reappraisal and distraction. In the
reappraisal model, reappraisal use was entered as the dependent variable, and ratings of
intensity and controllability served as predictors. A similar model was used for distraction, in
which distraction use was entered as the dependent variable.

Discussion
Experiment 1 revealed significant insights on EER use during routine time. The
participants reported improved affect after providing support, demonstrating the positive
impact of engaging in EER. We replicate prior findings showing the benefits of EER (Arbel et
al., 2022; Massarwe & Cohen, 2023, 2024; Morelli et al., 2015; Niven et al., 2012; Schacter &
Margolin, 2019). Supporting our predictions, the use of reappraisal was influenced by
controllability and the interaction between situational intensity and controllability, with
participants being more likely to use reappraisal in uncontrollable versus controllable situations
when emotional intensity was low. Conversely, distraction was not significantly affected by
these factors. These findings highlight the complex dynamics of strategy use in EER and
suggest that individuals adapt their support approaches based on situational factors. General
discussion includes more details.
Experiment 2 (Stress-time)
Method
Participants
The power analysis was similar to that of Experiment 1, indicating that 50 participants
were required to achieve a power greater than 80%. The total sample of Experiment 2 included
98 participants who completed the experiment three months following the onset of the Israel-
Hamas war that started on October 7, 2023 (from January and February 2024). Seven
participants were excluded due to low motivation to regulate others' emotions (mean ratings of
motivation were less than 2 on a 1-5 scale), and one participant was excluded for not following
the task instructions. The final sample consisted of 90 participants (mean age = 28.1 years, SD
material).
Procedure and Materials
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Education,
University of Haifa, Israel (426/23). The study was conducted online via the Qualtrics survey
platform with instructions provided by email. The procedure and participant compensation
were identical to those used in experiment 1.
The EER Task
The EER task was identical to Experiment 1, but modified to refer to war-related
situations. Examples include distress due to a close relative's war-related injury and frustration
from the excessive consumption of war-related news on social media. Participants followed the
same procedure as in Experiment 1, including rating the scenarios on perceived intensity and
controllability, rating their positive and negative feelings, writing supportive letters, and
subsequently reporting their feelings and EER strategy use.
Questionnaires
The same demographic variables and questionnaires as those in Experiment 1 were
collected. Additional measures related to war exposure and outcomes were also collected and
are not discussed in this paper.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted using the same methods as in Experiment 1, employing linear
mixed-effects regression models to investigate the effect of EER on affect, and GLMM to
examine the effect of situational factors on EER strategies.

Situational Factors
Similar to Experiment 1, for reappraisal use, the effect of intensity was not significant,
F(1, 634) = 0.24, p = 0.63. In addition, replicating the findings of Experiment 1, the effect of
controllability was significant, F(1, 634) = 6.54, p < 0.05, η² = 0.01, indicating that participants
used reappraisal more in low versus highly controllable situations. However, in contrast to

effect of controllability was larger in low-versus high-intensity situations (estimated difference
Discussion
Experiment 2, conducted during a period of significant stress three months after the
onset of the Israel-Hamas war, revealed both similarities and differences compared to
Experiment 1. As predicted, similar to Experiment 1, participants experienced improved affect
after providing support, suggesting that engaging in EER remains beneficial, even in times of
widespread stress (Arbel et al., 2022; Massarwe & Cohen, 2023, 2024; Morelli et al., 2015;
Niven et al., 2012; Schacter & Margolin, 2019). In line with our prediction, the use of
reappraisal was influenced by controllability, with participants using it more in uncontrollable
situations; however, unlike Experiment 1, the interaction between intensity and controllability
was not significant. Notably, distraction use showed significant effects for both intensity and
controllability as well as their interaction, in contrast to Experiment 1, where these factors had
no significant impact. The participants used distraction more in controllable situations,
particularly when the intensity was low. These findings suggest that stress may alter EER
strategy selection, potentially reflecting adaptations in regulatory approaches during periods of
prolonged stress. A comparison of the two studies regarding strategy use may explain these
findings. General discussion includes more details.
Comparison Between Experiments
The comparison between Experiments 1
(routine-time) and 2 (stress-time) revealed
significant insights into the impact of
widespread stress on emotional states and
regulation strategies.

Strategy Use
Participants used distraction more in the stress-time experiment than in the routine-time
experiment, t(86.108) = − 2.747, p <.01. Contrary to our predictions, no significant differences
The most notable difference in regulation strategies was the increased use of distraction
during stress, while reappraisal use remained consistent. This shift towards distraction may
indicate an adaptive response to prolonged stress, possibly as a means to temporarily disengage
from overwhelming emotions (Coifman et al., 2007; Kleiber et al., 2002). The consistent use
of reappraisal across both contexts suggests its robustness as a strategy regardless of
background stress levels. These findings highlight the complex interplay between
environmental stressors and individual regulation strategies, emphasizing the need for flexible
approaches to emotion regulation during times of stress.
General Discussion
The current study examined the role of stress and situational factors in EER. In two
studies, one conducted during routine times and the other during the Israel-Hamas war,
participants were asked to provide support in writing to events presumably written by other
participants and reported their use of reappraisal and distraction. We manipulated the
controllability and intensity levels of events. Replicating prior findings (Arbel et al., 2022;
Massarwe & Cohen, 2023, 2024; Morelli et al., 2015; Niven et al., 2012; Schacter & Margolin,
2019), our results showed beneficial outcomes for EER in improving participants’ positive and
negative affects. Importantly, this effect was observed both during routine (Study 1) and during
high stress conditions (Study 2). With regard to strategy use, the results showed an effect of
controllability on reappraisal use in both experiments as well as an interaction between
intensity and controllability in Study 1 due to a larger use of reappraisal for uncontrollable
situations, mainly under low-intensity situations. There were also effects of intensity and
controllability on distraction use in Study 2, in which distraction use was overall higher than
in Study 1, possibly due to the heightened stress imposed by the war situation.
One of the central findings of both experiments is that engaging in EER, regardless of
the stress context, leads to significant affect improvements for the support provider. This
finding underscores the well-documented benefits of helping others, indicating that we help
ourselves in the process (Arbel et al., 2022; Massarwe & Cohen, 2023, 2024; Morelli et al.,
2015). Together, these findings reinforce the importance of EER in fostering social bonds and
emotional resilience, particularly during times of widespread stress. There are several
explanations for the benefits of EER for support providers. First, supporting others through
EER may serve as a form of self-regulation that benefits the provider’s emotional state
(Schacter & Margolin, 2019). Second, although there are costs associated with providing
emotional support (Guendelman et al., 2022), especially for those who provide chronic support
(Bastawrous, 2013; Given et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2020), shifting from the role of a passive
observer to that of an active EER provider appears to mitigate these costs (Doré et al., 2017b).
Research suggests that prosocial behaviors, including EER, play a crucial role in promoting
mental health and resilience. Specifically, prosocial behavior is known to be associated with
various beneficial outcomes, such as lower mortality (Brown et al., 2003), better overall health
(Piferi & Lawler, 2006), improved mood (Schacter & Margolin, 2019), reduced perceived
stress (Raposa et al., 2016), higher levels of happiness (Dunn et al., 2008), and an enhanced
sense of personal worth (Klein, 2017). Prosocial acts reinforce social support, enhance
resilience, and promote overall well-being (Ramkissoon, 2022). Similar effects were also
observed during times of crisis, such as wars and pandemics. For example, prosocial behaviors
are associated with reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression among adolescent war
survivors (Haroz et al., 2013). Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, prosocial
interventions have been proposed as a potential low-cost approach to safeguarding mental
health and fostering emotional well-being (Arbel et al., 2022; Miles et al., 2022). Based on the
idea that EER is a form of prosocial behavior, our findings suggest that EER serves as an
adaptive mechanism in times of enduring stress. These findings emphasize the importance of
EER in building resilience and maintaining mental health, particularly in high-stress contexts,
such as war or global health crises.
The use of distraction and reappraisal as EER strategies revealed a complex picture in
the two experiments. During routine times (Study 1), reappraisal was more frequently used in
low-intensity, uncontrollable situations. This aligns with the strategy-situation-fit hypothesis,
which suggests that reappraisal is more beneficial in situations perceived as less controllable
(Haines et al., 2016). Interestingly, while in Experiment 1 reappraisal was more influenced by
controllability in low-intensity situations, Experiment 2 (stress-time) showed a main effect of
controllability (i.e., no interaction with intensity). Notably, in both experiments, intensity had
no main effect on reappraisal use. This lack of an intensity effect may be due to the differences
between IER and EER (Niven et al., 2009; Zaki & Craig Williams, 2013), as EER involves
regulating another person's emotions rather than one's own. In EER, the emotional intensity
experienced by the provider may differ from that of the recipient, potentially leading to
different patterns of strategy use compared with IER. Additionally, our use of vignettes rather
than pictures, a common methodology in other studies (Shafir et al., 2015; Sheppes et al., 2011),
may have influenced the perception of emotional intensity. The preference for reappraisal in
low-intensity, uncontrollable situations during routine times may be due to the availability of
cognitive resources to effectively engage in this demanding process (Troy et al., 2013). Indeed,
research indicates that individuals with higher well-being tend to use reappraisal more in
uncontrollable situations and less in controllable ones (Haines et al., 2016).
The use of distraction as an EER strategy showed notable differences between routine
and stress contexts, particularly in relation to emotional intensity. The results indicated higher
use of distraction during times of stress than during routine times, suggesting its role as a
protective mechanism when cognitive resources are depleted (Gross, 1998; Sheppes et al.,
2014). During routine times (Experiment 1), distraction did not show significant variation
based on emotional intensity. However, during stress times (Experiment 2), an effect of
controllability on distraction use was observed, particularly in low-intensity situations. This
shift implies that during periods of heightened stress, individuals may increasingly rely on
distraction to manage controllable situations, possibly to reduce immediate emotional arousal
without fully processing emotional information that requires more cognitive resources
(Sheppes, 2020b). Increased reliance on distraction during stress underscores its immediate
utility in high-pressure situations, aligning with research emphasizing its effectiveness in
providing short-term emotional relief (Sheppes et al., 2014). Distraction requires fewer
cognitive resources than reappraisal (Sheppes & Meiran, 2008), making it an attractive option
when individuals want to conserve cognitive resources or avoid cognitive demands (Kool et
al., 2010). The stability of reappraisal use alongside increased distraction suggests that
individuals may employ both strategies complementarily, using distraction for immediate relief
in intense situations and reappraisal for long-term coping.
Our study is the first to examine EER in the context of heightened stress (war zone).
The population showed high psychological distress, as evidenced by the DASS scores, which
aligns with the findings of previous studies (Enav et al., 2025; Levi-Belz et al., 2024; Lim et
al., 2022). Importantly, perceptions of intensity and controllability did not differ significantly
between routine and stress contexts, suggesting that the events chosen by the research group
were similar in terms of these parameters in both studies. Additionally, these findings suggest
that individuals maintain a consistent appraisal of specific situations even when their overall
stress levels are elevated. This highlights the distinction between general stress and situational
evaluations, suggesting that while stress may influence strategy selection, it does not
necessarily alter how individuals perceive specific emotional events (Galatzer-Levy et al.,
2018; Southwick & Charney, 2012).
This study had some limitations. First, our emotional events are based on text/vignettes,
and not on pictorial or video stimuli, as is commonly done in the emotion regulation literature.
Although texts may be more complex in terms of the information they carry (which can
introduce the effects of motivation, similarity, and other factors), these stimuli are more
ecologically valid and encompass a more dynamic and contextually rich exploration of emotion
regulation. Therefore, our design allowed us to investigate the use of EER in a more
ecologically valid manner by examining how individuals engage in it in response to realistic
and complex emotional situations. It is noteworthy that the participants were told at the
beginning of the task that all the emotional situations they would read were written by other
people who may receive their supportive letters. Second, while the use of war-related scenarios
in Experiment 2 enhanced ecological validity, it may limit the generalizability of our findings
to other stressors (Galatzer-Levy et al., 2018). Third, the sample was limited to Jewish Israelis,
which restricts the generalizability of the findings to other populations. Fourth, while our study
design allowed for a controlled examination of specific EER processes, the task cannot capture
the complexities of real-life EER because it lacks the dynamic nature of face-to-face
conversations (Gross, 2015). To avoid potential confounds, we did not implement a real-time
conversation format; instead, we opted for a standardized approach using pre-written messages.
This method, similar to that employed in previous studies (Arbel et al., 2020; Cheung &
Gardner, 2015; Massarwe & Cohen, 2024; Nozaki & Mikolajczak, 2022), allowed us to control
for factors, such as response time and message content, which could otherwise introduce
confounding variables. Participants interacted with strangers, mirroring interactions on social
media platforms where individuals often engaged in emotional exchanges with unfamiliar
others, sometimes without receiving feedback (Burke & Kraut, 2016). This parallel to real-
world online interactions enhances the external validity of our findings, suggesting potential
applications for understanding and improving digital communication (Oh et al., 2014).
However, we acknowledge that our controlled setting lacks certain elements of real social
interactions, such as relationship dynamics, nonverbal cues, immediate feedback, and ongoing
dialogue, which likely influence strategy selection and effectiveness (Zaki & Craig Williams,
2013). Future studies could build on our findings by incorporating more dynamic, real-time
interactions or using experience sampling methods to capture EER processes in daily life
(Haines et al., 2016). Participants’ post-study feedback revealed that they genuinely believed
they were interacting with real individuals, enhancing the ecological validity of our findings.
Notably, motivation to regulate emotions may differ between known individuals and
anonymous recipients, potentially limiting the generalizability to real-world contexts (Tamir &
Ford, 2012).
The sixth limitation concerns the assessment of the positive and negative affect. This
assessment included only one item each for positive affect and one item for negative affect.
Although this design is common (Weidman et al., 2017), using multiple items can reveal a more
nuanced pattern. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that we did not perform baseline mood
assessment in this study. Specifically, the first affect assessment was conducted after reading
about the emotional situation, which probably increased negative affect. Seventh, our study
focused specifically on reappraisal and distraction strategies, which limited the scope of our
findings. It is important to note that literature in this field commonly focuses on these two
strategies and situational factors, potentially overlooking other influential variables. Other
situational factors, such as the provider’s recent experiences, may have significant effects on
the emotion regulation process and outcomes (Matthews et al., 2021). Future research could
incorporate baseline mood measures prior to emotional content exposure and expand the range
of emotion regulation strategies and situational factors examined.
This study offers novel insights into the complex dynamics of EER and reveals how
situational factors and background stress influence strategy use. Our results demonstrate that
EER improves mood across contexts, and that different strategies, such as reappraisal and
distraction, are implemented flexibly based on the specific demands of the emotional
environment. These findings have significant implications for theoretical models of EER and
for the development of tailored interventions aimed at improving well-being, particularly under
high stress conditions. The differential use of reappraisal and distraction across routine and
stress-time contexts suggests that interventions should be tailored to the situational demands.
In high-stress environments, emphasis could be placed on distraction for immediate relief while
also incorporating reappraisal training for long-term emotional regulation. Moreover, programs
should provide individuals with a flexible set of skills that allow them to adapt their strategies
to the emotional intensity and controllability of each situation. This context-sensitive approach
can foster well-being and interpersonal resilience in both routine and high stress settings. As
the field of EER continues to evolve, future research should deepen our understanding of the
contextual and individual factors shaping its impact on emotional and interpersonal
functioning. By doing so, we can help individuals navigate through the complex emotional
dynamics of everyday life and extraordinary circumstances.
