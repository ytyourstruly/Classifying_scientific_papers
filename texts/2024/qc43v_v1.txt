Abstract
Substantial minorities of the population report a low degree of trust in sci-
ence, or endorse conspiracy theories that violate basic scientific knowledge.
This might indicate a wholesale rejection of science. In four studies, we asked
782 US participants questions about trust in science, conspiracy beliefs, and
basic science (e.g. the relative size of electrons and atoms). Participants
were provided with the scientifically consensual answer to the basic science
questions, and asked whether they accept it. Acceptance of the scientific
consensus was very high in the sample as a whole (95.1%), but also in every
sub-sample (e.g., no trust in science: 87.3%; complete endorsement of flat
Earth theory: 87.2%). This quasi-universal acceptance of basic science sug-
gests that people are motivated to reject specific scientific beliefs, and not
science as a whole. This could be leveraged in science communication.
Keywords: Trust in science; conspiracy theories; conspiracy thinking; science
knowledge.
Introduction
Trust in science is related to many desirable outcomes, from acceptance of anthro-
pogenic climate change (Cologna & Siegrist, 2020) or vaccination (Lindholt, Jørgensen, Bor,
& Petersen, 2021; Sturgis, Brunton-Smith, & Jackson, 2021) to following recommendations
during COVID (Algan, Cohen, Davoine, Foucault, & Stantcheva, 2021, which suggests that
trust in science was the most important predictor of these behaviors).
Unfortunately, people who report a high degree of trust in science are a minority in
most countries, and they are outnumbered by people who have low trust in science in many
areas, e.g., most of Africa and significant parts of Asia (Wellcome Global Monitor, 2018,
2020). Moreover, trust in science has recently been declining in some countries (Algan et

al., 2021; although see Wellcome Global Monitor, 2021), including the US (Brian & Tyson,
2023), where it is also increasingly polarizing (Gauchat, 2012; Krause, Brossard, Scheufele,
Xenos, & Franke, 2019; Li & Qian, 2022). Rejection of science can take the more extreme
form of conspiracy theories, many of which question the scientific consensus on vaccination,
climate change, and even the shape of the Earth.
What does this apparent rejection of science actually entail? Do people who say they
do not trust science, or who believe in conspiracy theories at odds with well-established
science, reject most of science? Or, on the contrary, do they object to a few specific facets
of science, while still accepting the overwhelming majority of basic science? Answering
this question has theoretical implications: if some people reject science wholesale, then it’s
possible that their distrust of science causes their rejection of specific scientific theories, or
facilitates their acceptance of conspiracy theories; by contrast, if everyone trusts most of
science, then the mistrust of specific facets of science is more likely to be post-hoc, a ratio-
nalization of other beliefs or behaviors. The present question also has practical implications:
many communication attempts leverage the scientific consensus (e.g. on vaccination, climate
change, etc., for review, see Van Stekelenburg, Schaap, Veling, Van ’T Riet, & Buijzen, 2022;
see also Većkalov et al., 2024). These attempts are more likely to be successful if everyone
trusts basic science than if some people reject science wholesale.
Studies of science knowledge provide relevant evidence, as people who answer science
knowledge questions correctly presumably trust scientists in this respect. The average level
of science knowledge is quite low, even in countries with extensive science education. For
example, only 55% in the US (in 2014) and only 46% in the EU (in 2005) knew that
antibiotics kill only bacteria and not viruses (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
and Medicine, 2016). However, these results only provide a lower bound on how much
people trust basic science, as participants who do not provide the correct answer might
accept it when it is pointed out to them.
The present studies
In a series of four pre-registered online studies (total n = 782), we asked US par-
ticipants questions about well-established scientific facts. For each question, we asked
participants what they thought the correct answer was (testing their knowledge of sci-
ence), we informed them of the scientifically accepted answer, and asked them whether
they accepted it (measuring their trust in basic science). We also measured participants’
trust in science using standard measures, as well as their beliefs in various conspiracy
theories and their tendency to engage in conspiratorial thinking. The four studies, in-
cluding materials, hypotheses, and analyses, were pre-registered and all materials and
364478f01fc548d0a42b9962918d871d). The differences between the four studies are summa-
rized presently, and the methods are detailed below.
Materials. In Study 1, we used questions drawn from questionnaires of scientific
knowledge (e.g. “Are electrons smaller, larger, or the same size as atoms? [Smaller; Same
size; Larger]”), supplemented by a ‘trick’ question (“Where do trees mainly draw the ma-
terials with which they create their mass? [Earth; Water; Air]”; correct answer: Air). In
Studies 2 and 3, this last question was removed. The scientific facts used in Studies 1 to 3
DOES ANYONE MISTRUST BASIC SCIENCE? 3
represent long-established and basic knowledge. In Study 4 we used more recent much less
basic scientific discoveries (e.g. “What is the electric charge of the Higgs Boson, as estab-
lished in 2012? [1.602176634 × 10-19; 0; 3.2×10-19C]”; correct answer: 0, i.e. electrically
neutral).
Presentation of the scientific consensus. In Study 1, we simply told partici-
pants that they would be provided with the scientifically consensual answer. However, for
participants to accept this answer, they must not only trust science, but also trust that we
are presenting them with the actual scientifically consensual answer. To remove this issue,
in Studies 2 to 3, we presented participants with a short explanation of the correct answer,
as well as links to three sources per answer (e.g. Wikipedia, National Geographic or NASA).
In Study 4, as the topics were more complex, we did not provide an explanation, but still
provided two sources per answer.
Measure of acceptance of the scientific consensus. In Study 1, we simply look
at whether participants say that they accept the scientifically consensual answer. In the
subsequent studies, we asked participants to explain why they disagreed with the scientific
consensus. This revealed that a number of participants had made a mistake (misunder-
standing, selecting the wrong answer). As a result, in Studies 3 and 4, participants who
have indicated that they rejected the scientifically consensual answer were offered the option
to revise their answer, or to keep rejecting it.
Additional questions. In Studies 3 and 4, we attempted to understand how some
people who say they do not trust science still accept scientifically consensual answers, by
asking them whether they accepted the answers on the basis of trust in science or because
they had independently verified them.
Samples. Studies 1 and 2 were conducted on the standard sample of US participants
recruited on the platform Prolific Academic. In order to increase the share of participants
with low trust in science, and who endorse conspiracy theories, Studies 3 and 4 used the
same platform, but only recruited participants who had declared previously being skeptical
of vaccination.
Hypotheses. The main goal of the present studies is descriptive: to find out
whether participants who report not trusting science, or who believe in conspiracy theories,
still accept most well-established scientific facts. However, we also tested two directional
hypotheses (pre-registered as research questions in the Study 1):
H1: Higher trust in science is associated with more science knowledge and
more acceptance of the scientific consensus
H2: Higher conspiracy thinking/belief is associated with less science
knowledge and less acceptance of the scientific consensus
Methods
Deviations from preregistration
For Study 2, we restricted our main hypotheses about acceptance to cases in which
participants initially provided a wrong answer. However, this meant the more participants
had initially provided correct answers, the fewer opportunities they had for accepting cor-
rect answers. We provide results on these conditional correlations–for Study 2 and for
DOES ANYONE MISTRUST BASIC SCIENCE? 4
all other studies–in the ESM, section G to J . However, for the analysis presented here,
we proceeded as preregistered for all other studies, by reporting unconditional correlations
between acceptance and trust in science, or, respectively, conspiracy belief.
Procedure
After providing their consent to participate in the study, participants were given an
attention check “While watching the television, have you ever had a fatal heart attack?”
[1-6; 1 = Never, 6 = Often]. All participants who did not answer “1 = Never” were
excluded. Participants then read the following instructions:“We will ask you 10 questions
about science. After each question, we will provide you with the scientifically consensual
answer and ask whether you accept it.” Next, participants answered a set of 10 basic science
questions in random order. After each question, participants were presented with an answer
reflecting the scientific consensus, and asked whether they accepted it. In Studies 2 and 3,
participants additionally saw a short explanation, partly based on explanations generated
by ChatGPT, and three links to authoritative sources supporting the answer. In Study 4,
we provided only two links and no explanation. Participants then answered questions on
conspiracy thinking, conspiracy beliefs, and trust in science.
In Studies 2, 3, and 4, we presented participants with open-ended questions so they
could explain their rejection of the scientific consensus. In Studies 3 and 4, we additionally
gave participants the option to change their answer and accept the scientific consensus.
Finally, at the end of Studies 3 and 4, we asked participants: “For the questions in which
you agreed with the scientific consensus, would you say that. . . ?” The answer options were:
(i) “You mostly agree with the consensus because, on that question, you trust scientists”,
(ii) “You mostly agree with the consensus because you have been able to independently
verify it”, and (iii) “Other”, with a text box for participants to explain. Participants who
selected “You mostly agree with the consensus because you have been able to independently
verify it”, were asked the open-ended follow-up question: “Could you please tell us how you
independently verified the information?”.
Participants
After removing failed attention checks, the total sample size was 782 (194 in Study
1, six failed attention checks; 190 in Study 2, 11 failed attention checks; 200 in Study
3, no failed attention checks; 198 in Study 4, two failed attention checks) participants in
the US, recruited through Prolific. Details and demographics can be found in the online
supplemental material. While samples for Studies 1 and 2 were convenience samples, Studies
3 and 4 were conducted on a sample holding vaccine-skeptic beliefs. Prolific allows selecting
participants based on their answers to a range of questions. We picked three of these
questions and only recruited participants who met our criteria for each of them:
Only in Study 4 do we find evidence that changing one’s mind towards the scientific consensus is
associated with (more) trust in science (Studies 1: r = 0.06, p = 0.387; 2: r = 0.16, p = 0.051; 3: r = 0.04,
p = 0.619; 4: r = 0.15, p = 0.037) and only in Study 2 evidence that it is associated with (less) conspiracy
beliefs and (less) conspiracy thinking (Studies 1: r = -0.14, p = 0.061; 2: r = -0.22, p = 0.006; 3: r = -0.04,
p = 0.631; 4: r = -0.05, p = 0.455).

1. “Please describe your attitudes towards the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) vaccines: [For
(I feel positively about the vaccines); Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines);
Neutral (I don’t have strong opinions either way); Prefer not to say]”. We selected
participants who answered “Against”.
2. “Have you received a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination? [Yes (at least one dose);
No; Prefer not to answer]”. We select only people who answered “No”.
3. “On a scale from 1-7, please rate to what extent you agree with the following state-
ment: I believe that scheduled immunizations are safe for children. [1 (totally dis-
agree); 2 (disagree); 3 (somewhat disagree); 4 (neither agree nor disagree); 5 (some-
what agree); 6 (agree); 7 (totally agree); rather not say]”. We select only people who
answered “1”, “2”, or “3”.
Materials
Scientific facts. Studies 1 to 3 used 10 facts drawn from widely used question-
naires about science knowledge (Allum, Sturgis, Tabourazi, & Brunton-Smith, 2008; Du-
rant, Evans, & Thomas, 1989; Miller, 1998) sometimes referred to as the “Oxford scale”
(Gauchat, 2011). A ‘trick’ question was added in Study 1 and removed as its wording proved
their answer options.

Conspiracy beliefs. We selected 10 science/health related conspiracy theories from
the Belief in Conspiracy Theory Inventory (BCTI) (Pennycook, Binnendyk, & Rand, 2022)
has been disputed. For each event, we would like you to indicate to what extent you believe
the cover-up version of events is true or false. [1-9; labels: 1 - completely false, 5 - unsure,
9 - completely true]”.
Conspiracy thinking. For all results presented here, we used the four-item con-
spiracy mentality questionnaire (CMQ) (Bruder, Haffke, Neave, Nouripanah, & Imhoff,
2013). We also assessed the single item conspiracy beliefs scale (SICBS) (Lantian, Muller,
Nurra, & Douglas, 2016). Details and comparisons between the scales can be found in the
ESM, sections G to J.
Conspiracy items
1 The Apollo moon landings never happened and were staged in a Hollywood film studio.
2 A cure for cancer was discovered years ago, but this has been suppressed by the
pharmaceutical industry and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
3 The spread of certain viruses and/or diseases is the result of the deliberate, concealed
efforts of vested interests.
4 The claim that the climate is changing due to emissions from fossil fuels is a hoax
perpetrated by corrupt scientists who want to spend more taxpayer money on climate
research.
5 The Earth is flat (not spherical) and this fact has been covered up by scientists and vested
interests.
6 There is a causal link between vaccination and autism that has been covered up by the
pharmaceutical industry.
7 In the 1950s and 1960s more than 100 million Americans received a polio vaccine
contaminated with a potentially cancer-causing virus.
8 Proof of alien contact is being concealed from the public.
9 Hydroxychloroquine has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective treatment of COVID
and this information is being suppressed.
10 Dinosaurs never existed, evolution is not real, and scientists have been faking the fossil
record.
Participants were asked to rate their belief in the conspiracy on a scale from 1 to 9, with the

Trust in science. In all analyses reported in the main paper, we measure trust
in science via a question selected from the Wellcome Global Monitor surveys (Wellcome
Global Monitor, 2018, 2020): “In general, would you say that you trust science a lot, some,
not much, or not at all? [1 = Not at all, 2 = Not much, 3 = Some, 4 = A lot]”. We
chose this question as it seemed to be the most general one. In the ESM (sections G to J),
we additionally report results for two alternative measures of trust included in our studies:
DOES ANYONE MISTRUST BASIC SCIENCE? 7
Another from the WGM surveys (“How much do you trust scientists in this country? Do
you trust them a lot, some, not much, or not at all? [1 = Not at all, 2 = Not much, 3 =
Some, 4 = A lot]”), and one from the Pew Research Center (e.g. Funk, Johnson, & Hefferon,
2019) (“How much confidence do you have in scientists to act in the best interests of the
public? [1-5; 1 = No confidence at all, 5 = A great deal of confidence]”), the latter having
been used in a recent international study on trust in science (Cologna et al., 2024). We
selected these items so that we could compare the answers in our sample to global survey
results. We find that all three items are generally highly correlated throughout all studies,
and that our results reported here generally replicate when using either of the alternatives
measures (with two exceptions: In Study 3, we find no correlation between acceptance and
the Pew question; In Study 4, we find a correlation between knowledge and both alternative
trust measures, but not with our main measure; see ESM, sections I and J).
Results
The main outcome of interest is acceptance of the scientifically consensual facts pre-
sented. Overall, acceptance was very high (aggregating across all studies: 95.1 %; Studies
1: 93 %; 2: 98 %; 3: 98 %; 4: 91 %). Note that this includes both participants who had
previously correctly answered the knowledge question, and participants who changed their
mind when presented with the scientific consensus. In Studies 3 and 4, we gave participants
a second chance in case they had initially rejected the consensus, which slightly increased
acceptance rates in those studies (initial acceptance in Studies 3: 96 %; 4: 86 %).
do not trust science at all (4.2 % of participants, acceptance rate of 87.3 %), participants
who rank in the top two deciles of the conspiracy thinking scale (34.3 % of participants,
acceptance rate of 93.2 %), participants who consider as “completely true” (the maximum
of the 9-point scale) conspiracy theories stating that the earth is flat (3.7 % of participants,
acceptance rate of 87.2 %), or that climate change due to fossil emissions is a hoax (11.4 %
of participants, acceptance rate of 91.7 %).
Participants in the lowest decile of acceptance still had an average acceptance rate of
67.4 %. Even the three participants who considered as “completely true” that the earth is
flat and who said they do “not trust science at all” had an average acceptance rate of 86.7
%.
These high acceptance rates do not merely reflect science knowledge: participants
only correctly answered 65.8 % of the questions (Studies 1: 74 %; 2: 79 %; 3: 75 %;
4: 36 %) before they were provided with the scientifically consensual answer. Even the
lowest decile in science knowledge, which on average answered correctly only on 20 % of the
questions, had an average acceptance rate of 91.7 %.
Did participants who had initially provided a wrong answer change their minds to-
wards the scientific consensus? Yes. In most cases (Studies 1: 76.3 %; 2: 92.9 %; 3: 95.5
%; 4: 89.5 %), participants readily accepted the scientific consensus after having initially
given the wrong answer to a question.
Regarding H1, we find a consistent association between trust in science and acceptance

Regarding H2, the results are mixed for the relation of conspiracy beliefs (measured
as the average acceptance of all the conspiracy beliefs) with both acceptance of the scientific
consensus (Studies 1: r = -0.33, p < .001; 2: r = -0.37, p < .001; 3: r = -0.02, p = 0.788; 4:

p < .001; 3: r = -0.16, p = 0.055; 4: r = -0.02, p = 0.742).
Why did participants reject the scientific consensus? We collected a total of 364
answers (Studies 2: 35; 3: 74; 4: 255) from 167 (Studies 2: 25; 3: 47; 4: 95) participants to
the open-ended questions on why they had rejected the scientific consensus on a particular
read in the ESM, sections H to J.
Why did participants say they accept the scientific consensus? In Studies 3 and 4–
the vaccine hesitant samples–we had asked participants about cases in which they agreed
with the scientific consensus. A total of 320 (Studies 3: 122; 4: 198) participants answered
this question. There were more participants saying they accepted the scientific consensus
because they independently verified the fact (Studies 3: 47.5%; 4: 47% ), than participants
saying it was because they trust scientists (Studies 3: 41.8%; 4: 36.4%) . Answers to a
question about how they had done so can be found in the ESM, sections I and J.
In an exploratory analysis, we ran linear regressions to test whether there are differ-
ences between participants who said they had trusted science and those who said they had
verified the information independently. Participants who said they accepted the consensus
because of trust in scientists reported trusting science more (Studies 3: mean = 3; β =

Discussion
US participants were asked whether they accepted scientifically consensual answers on
basic science questions.We found quasi-universal acceptance of basic science, with an overall
rate of acceptance of 95.1 %, which remained very high for participants who declared not
trusting science at all (87.3 % of acceptance), or who endorsed theories blatantly violating
scientific knowledge, such as flat earth (87.2 % of acceptance).
Overall, the present findings support the motivated rejection of science model
(Lewandowsky & Oberauer, 2016), in which “people tend to reject findings that threaten
their core beliefs or worldview” (p. 217). A number of participants in our studies rejected
basic tenets of science (on evolution, the shape of the earth, etc.). However, they still ac-
cepted the vast majority of basic scientific knowledge presented to them. This suggests that
these participants had reasons to reject specific scientific knowledge, and that this rejection
prompted them to express a lower trust in science when asked general questions on the
topic. These participants did not appear to have general grounds for distrusting science,
which should have led them to reject most or all of the science knowledge presented to them.
These results are in line with several recent studies in which conspiracy theorists are not
less susceptible to social influence in general (Altay, Nera, Ejaz, Schöpfer, & Tomas, 2023;
Pummerer, Fock, Winter, & Sassenberg, n.d.).
Our findings are also relevant for the knowledge–attitudes model of trust in science
(see, e.g., Bauer, Allum, & Miller, 2007). The fact that even people with low science
knowledge trust most of basic science might be taken as showing the power of even a
modicum of science knowledge; on the other hand, it also means that attempts at increasing
science knowledge in general might not have much effect on trust in science, by contrast
with targeting the specific beliefs people are motivated to reject.
Finally, some of the present results also speak to the alienation model (Gauchat,
For these analyses, we excluded outliers who took over 30 mins for the survey, which was estimated
to take around 10 mins, and for which the median time was seven minutes. As a result, we excluded one
participant in Study 3 and four in Study 4. Significance levels are not affected by these exclusions.

2011), and more specifically to the need for epistemic autonomy (Fricker, 2006). Declaring
not trusting science, or endorsing conspiracy theories (Harris, 2023) might reflect a desire to
maintain epistemic autonomy and not appear to ‘blindly’ accept epistemic authority. The
acceptance of basic science facts would be reconciled with this need to appear epistemically
autonomous by the suggestion that the acceptance stems from independent evaluation in-
stead of trust (however implausible that might be: it’s not clear how participants could
independently verify the ratio of glial cells to neurons, say, and few participants appeared
to have engaged in even simple forms of verification).
In applied terms, the present results suggest the existence of a vast reservoir of trust
in basic science that can be tapped into in science communication. Since people appear
so resistant to rejecting basic science, stressing the basic science components of publicly
controversial fields, from GMOs to climate change, might help reduce the ‘consensus gaps’
observed in these domains (on climate change, see, e.g. Ranney & Clark, 2016).
The present studies have a number of limitations, in particular the lack of represen-
tative samples, and the focus on a single country. We hope that future studies will extend
our findings to other populations.
