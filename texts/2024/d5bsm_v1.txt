ASSESSING AUDITORY PROCESSING IN BILINGUALS 2
37 Abstract
38 Purpose: While central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) evaluations assess specific
39 auditory skills necessary for efficient processing and understanding of complex auditory signals,
40 many tests included in these evaluations rely heavily on language. This poses an issue for non-
41 native English speakers, and it remains unclear whether testing these individuals in a secondary
42 language produces an accurate clinical assessment and diagnosis. Our study aimed to
43 determine the most appropriate language for CAPD assessment in bilingual speakers.
44 Method: Twenty-five Spanish-English bilingual speakers participated in this repeated measures
45 study to assess binaural processing performance when evaluated using test materials in their
46 native (Spanish) and secondary (English) languages. Binaural integration and separation were
47 assessed using dichotic digits, competing words, and competing sentences. Participants
48 completed these assessments twice—once in Spanish, once in English. Performance on the
49 binaural tasks was compared between languages to determine if the language used for
50 instruction and assessment impacted auditory processing performance.
51 Results: Performance varied by language for more challenging auditory tasks (i.e., dichotic
52 digits, competing words) with participants performing poorer when materials were administered
53 in English. Increasing age emphasized these language differences and revealed interaural
54 asymmetries.
55 Conclusions: These findings suggest testing Spanish-English bilinguals with English materials
56 may provide inaccurate representations of their binaural processing abilities, even when they
57 are considered to be proficient in English. Impaired performance may more likely be attributed
58 to language differences rather than true auditory processing deficits. Therefore, non-native
59 English speakers should be assessed for CAPD using test materials in their native language
60 whenever possible.

ASSESSING AUDITORY PROCESSING IN BILINGUALS 4
63 Introduction
64 Central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) is caused by a disruption within the central
65 auditory pathway that impairs processing of complex or degraded auditory inputs. Patients with
66 this condition often present with normal hearing but still report problems understanding speech.
67 This commonly manifests as individuals having difficulty understanding speech in challenging
68 listening environments (e.g., noisy backgrounds, reverberant environments, rapid speech),
69 localizing sounds, and following complex auditory instructions (American Speech-Language-
70 Hearing Association, n.d.).
71 An underlying auditory skill vital to complex listening is binaural processing, or the ability
72 to utilize auditory cues from both ears. Binaural processing can be further classified into two
73 distinct components: binaural integration and binaural separation. Binaural integration refers to
74 the listener's ability to combine auditory information presented to both ears, allowing the brain to
75 synthesize a unified perceptual message. In contrast, binaural separation involves the capacity
76 to isolate and attend to auditory input from one ear while ignoring competing stimuli from the
77 opposite ear. These complementary processes are critical for effective auditory perception of
78 speech in complex listening environments and allows listeners to better separate relevant from
79 irrelevant inputs.
80 While auditory processing evaluations assess specific auditory skills necessary for
81 efficient processing and understanding of complex auditory signals (like binaural processing),
82 many of the tests rely heavily on language. This poses an issue for individuals for whom English
83 is not their native language. Because the tests are linguistically loaded, the obtained results do
84 not clearly identify whether an issue should be attributed to a central auditory processing deficit
85 or to the language used in the test materials. Thus, audiologists are often hesitant to test
86 bilingual patients who demonstrate features of CAPD.
87 It is possible that bilingual individuals would perform more favorably when tested in their
88 native language (L1). Indeed, differences in complex auditory task performance have been seen
ASSESSING AUDITORY PROCESSING IN BILINGUALS 5
89 in Spanish-English bilinguals when materials were presented in Spanish versus English (Lopez
90 et al., 1997). Recently, Canz and colleagues (2021) studied test-language effects in bilingual
91 education and described significant improvements in performance when bilinguals were
92 instructed and tested in their native language compared to performance in their later acquired
93 language (L2). Numerous studies have also assessed monolingual vs. bilingual performance in
94 complex auditory tasks including listening in noise, auditory memory, and competing speech
95 (Bsharat-Maalouf & Karawani, 2022; Gresele et al., 2013; Krizman et al., 2017; Mendel &
96 Widner, 2016; Sharifinik et al., 2021; Shokuhifar et al., 2024; Skoe & Karayanidi, 2019; Zadeh et
97 al., 2018). While much research in auditory processing of bilingual speakers compares
98 performance between monolinguals and bilinguals, evidence to inform best clinical practice in
99 the assessment of CAPD in bilinguals is lacking. To date, relatively few studies investigate
100 performance within the same participant with test language being the differential factor.
101 Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare binaural processing performance in
102 Spanish-English bilingual participants when tested in Spanish (L1) versus when they are tested
103 in English (L2). Based on prior literature, we suspect that bilingual participants will perform
104 better when they are instructed and presented with assessments in their native language versus
105 when they are assessed in their later acquired language. However, it is possible that our
106 participants, who are proficient in both L1 and L2, will show no difference in task performance.
107 Regardless, by comparing binaural processing performance in bilingual participants, we will
108 clarify whether testing bilingual individuals in a secondary language (when proficient in that
109 language) results in valid and reliable measures of their auditory processing abilities. Thus, our
110 results will provide evidence to establish best clinical practice when evaluating bilingual listeners
111 for auditory processing deficits. This will enable clinicians to more confidently evaluate and
112 diagnose CAPD in bilingual populations.
113 To determine the most appropriate language for CAPD evaluations in bilingual speakers,
114 we measured binaural processing abilities in adults with normal hearing using common central
ASSESSING AUDITORY PROCESSING IN BILINGUALS 6
115 auditory processing tests in both English and Spanish. Our findings revealed that performance
116 for binaural processing tasks varied by language with participants performing better in their
117 native language, especially for more challenging auditory tasks. Furthermore, effects of test
118 language were more apparent with increasing participant age. These results emphasize the
119 importance of testing individuals in their native language to accurately assess auditory
120 processing abilities and limit the confounding influence of secondary language processing.
121 Method
122 Participants
123 Twenty-five adults (9 males, 16 females), aged 18 to 55 years (M = 33.48, SD = 11.17),
124 were recruited to participate in this study. All participants were bilingual speakers with Spanish
125 as their native language (L1) and English as a second language (L2). Participants had no
126 known history of traumatic brain injuries (TBI), neurological, learning, or hearing disorders.
127 Additionally, participants did not express auditory processing concerns such as difficulty
128 understanding speech in noisy environments, family concerns about poor communication, or
129 poor understanding of instructions in challenging listening environments at the time of
130 participation. All participants exhibited normal middle ear function as assessed by
131 tympanometry and had normal hearing sensitivity bilaterally [symmetric (≤10 dB) hearing
132 thresholds ≤25 dB HL tested at octave frequencies 250-8000 Hz; left pure tone average (PTA):
133 M = 9.80, SD = 3.31; right PTA: M = 9.87, SD = 3.72]. If a hearing loss was identified (n = 4),
134 the individual was appropriately counseled, referred for diagnostic testing, and excluded from
135 participation in the current study. All participants provided written informed consent in
136 compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and a protocol approved by the University of
137 Arkansas for Medical Sciences IRB.
138 Language Proficiency
ASSESSING AUDITORY PROCESSING IN BILINGUALS 7
139 Language proficiency in both Spanish and English was assessed via questionnaire and
140 online proficiency tests offered by Transparent Language (Transparent Language, Inc., Nashua,
141 NH). The questionnaire enabled participants to subjectively rate their proficiency in Spanish and
142 English in the areas of reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Participants used a Likert scale
143 ranging from 1 (very poor) to 7 (native-like); thus, a higher score reflects greater self-perceived
144 proficiency. On average, participants rated themselves as very good to native-like for both
145 languages across these categories (Spanish M = 6.45, SD = 0.80; English M = 6.18, SD =
146 0.65). The proficiency tests assessed grammar, vocabulary, and reading comprehension in
147 each language. All participants scored above 80% on the assessment indicating language
148 proficiency (Mendel & Widner, 2016) for both Spanish (M = 89.60%, SD = 0.05) and English (M
149 = 89.76%, SD = 0.04). Measured proficiency did not differ between languages (t = 0.13, p =
150 0.90). Average reported age of L2 acquisition was 8.64 years (SD = 7.9) with the majority of
151 participants (n = 20) learning English by the age of 12.
152 Auditory Processing Assessments
153 Following the hearing evaluation and language proficiency assessments, participants
154 completed auditory processing tests that evaluate binaural integration and separation. Each
155 participant was tested twice, once in Spanish and once in English, using dichotic digits, dichotic
156 words, and competing sentences. To control for potential differences in test materials and
157 maintain as much consistency as possible, tests were selected that had validated and recorded
158 materials available in both Spanish and English. Thus, the auditory processing assessments
159 were matched across language as best as possible. Additionally, the selection of these specific
160 tasks allowed us to evaluate performance on verbal assessments of varied difficulty and
161 linguistic load.
162 Instructions were provided prior to each test in the language of the test materials (i.e.,
163 participants were instructed in Spanish for Spanish test materials). The presentation order of
ASSESSING AUDITORY PROCESSING IN BILINGUALS 8
164 tests (i.e. dichotic digits, dichotic words, competing sentences) and test language (i.e., Spanish
165 and English) were counterbalanced across participants to minimize fatigue and order effects.
166 Speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) were obtained prior to auditory processing assessments
167 to determine the appropriate presentation levels for each participant.
168 Dichotic Digits
169 For the dichotic digit tasks, we used the Auditec Dichotic Digit Test - Standard (double
170 pairs; English) (Musiek, 1983) and the Dichotic Digit section from the Santiago APD for
171 Spanish-Speaking Adults (SAPD) battery (Fuente, 2015). During these tests, participants heard
172 a list of 20 number pairs presented at 50 dB SL (re: SRT). Each test item contained two pairs of
173 numbers presented to both ears simultaneously (i.e., two numbers per ear). After each
174 presentation, participants were asked to recall as many of the four numbers they could in any
175 order. Stimuli for the dichotic digits task included single syllable numerals in English (i.e., 1-9
176 excluding 7) and numerals 1-9 in Spanish. The number 7 is excluded in English because it is
177 the only bisyllabic numeral while this difference is not as distinct in Spanish (i.e., Spanish
178 contains both monosyllabic and bisyllabic numerals). Performance on each dichotic digit task
179 was determined by calculating the percent correct score for each ear.
180 Dichotic Words
181 For competing words tasks, the Dichotic Word Listening Test (DWLT) (Roberts et al.,
182 1994) and the Spanish Dichotic Word Listening Test (Spanish DWLT) (Auditec, Inc., St. Louis,
183 MO) were used for English and Spanish testing, respectively. During these tests, two words
184 were presented simultaneously, one in each ear. Stimuli for these tasks are commonly-used 1
185 to 3 syllable words appropriate for elementary-aged children (Roberts et al., 1994). Word pairs
186 are balanced so that the words are approximately equal in length and match in number of
187 syllables. Test stimuli are preceded by the carrier phrase, “Now repeat…” and participants were
188 instructed to repeat both words. The order of repetition was not important. For each test
ASSESSING AUDITORY PROCESSING IN BILINGUALS 9
189 (English and Spanish), a list of 30-word pairs were presented at 50 dB SL (re: SRT).
190 Performance was calculated as percent correct for each ear.
191 Synthetic Sentence Identification (SSI) Test
192 To evaluate participants’ abilities to separate competing information between ears and
193 ignore unwanted information, we used the Synthetic Sentence Identification – Contralateral
194 Competing Message (SSI-CCM) test (Jerger & Jerger, 1974) and the Synthetic Sentence
195 Identification – Contralateral Competing Message Spanish Version [Examen para la
196 Identificación de Oraciones Sintéticas- Mensaje Contralateral de Competencia (SSI-CCM)]
197 (Auditec Inc., St. Louis, MO) for English and Spanish assessments, respectively. During these
198 tests, nonsense sentences were presented to the test ear at 30 dB SL (re: SRT), while a
199 narrator telling a story served as a distractor in the non-test ear. The story was presented at 70
200 dB SL (re: SRT) in the non-test ear creating the most challenging listening scenario, or message
201 to competition ratio (MCR). One block of 10 nonsense sentences was presented at a time, and
202 participants were provided a sheet of paper listing the ten nonsense sentences to choose from.
203 Participants were instructed to indicate which sentence was presented in the target ear while
204 ignoring the speech in the opposite ear. If the participant correctly identified all the sentences
205 presented at the most difficult MCR (-40 dB MCR), then testing concluded. If they did not score
206 100% correct, the intensity level in the non-test ear was decreased in 10 dB steps until the
207 participant achieved a perfect score or until the intensity level of the signal in the test ear and
208 the distractor in the non-test ear were the same dB SL (0 dB MCR; signal and distractor each
209 presented at 30 dB SL). The MCR at which participants were able to identify all 10 sentences
210 was recorded for each ear separately to analyze interaural performance differences.
211 Data Analysis
212 Mixed model linear regressions were used to evaluate performance differences on
213 binaural integration and separation tasks presented in Spanish (L1) vs. English (L2). Model
ASSESSING AUDITORY PROCESSING IN BILINGUALS 10
214 building processes implemented backward selection which resulted in the most simplistic model
215 for each assessment (digits, words, sentences) while still capturing relevant, complex
216 interactions between variables. Because age (Bellis & Wilber, 2001; Jerger et al., 1994;
217 Sardone et al., 2019) and education (Murphy et al., 2016) have been shown to influence
218 auditory processing ability, they were included as covariates in all models. Tukey post-hoc
219 adjustments were used to correct for multiple comparisons when necessary. We verified all
220 variables met statistical assumptions prior to analyses.
221 Results
222 Dichotic Digits
224 assessment when test materials were presented in English and Spanish. Accuracy in identifying
225 the presented digits is separated by ear of presentation. An ANOVA conducted on performance
226 accuracy revealed a main effect of test language (F = 9.41, p = 0.005) with performance in
1,24
227 Spanish (M = 97.40%, SEM = 0.58; CI 95%: 96.19, 98.61) being better than English (M =
228 94.87%, SEM = 0.58, CI 95%: 93.66, 96.07). This difference appears to be driven by the greater
229 accuracy when digits were presented in Spanish to the right ear, yet the test language x ear
230 interaction did not reach significance (F = 2.61, p = 0.12). Although performance is poorer
1,24
231 when test materials were presented in English, the 95% confidence interval did not fall outside
232 of the normative range used for clinical determination of CAPD (normative cut-off for adults:
233 90% correct for each ear; Musiek, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center).
234 [Insert Fig. 1 near here]
235 The regression model also revealed a main effect of age on accuracy in identifying
236 dichotic digits (F = 12.74, p = 0.002) and an age x ear interaction (F = 4.94, p = 0.03) as
1,22 1,71
238 the left ear while performance for digits presented to the right ear did not vary based on
239 participant age.

240 [Insert Fig. 2 near here]
241 Additionally, years of education was identified as a significant predictor of dichotic digits
242 task performance (F = 6.91, p = 0.02). Individuals who had more years of formal education
1,22
243 demonstrated greater accuracy on the dichotic digits assessment than those with less formal
244 education. For every additional year of formal education, participants’ percent correct scores on
245 the dichotic digits task improved by 0.37 (SEM = 0.14) when holding all other variables
246 constant.

251 ear of presentation (F = 9.96, p = 0.004) and an ear x test language interaction (F = 7.55,
1,24 1,24
252 p = 0.01). No main effect of test language was noted (F = 0.17, p = 0.69). The main effect of
1,24
253 ear of presentation suggests that performance was better when words were presented to the
254 right ear regardless of test language. This effect is likely driven by the interaural asymmetry
255 observed in the English test condition. Post-hoc Tukey adjustments indicated a significant
256 interaural asymmetry between ears when test materials were presented in English (t = -4.17, p
257 = 0.002; right ear: M = 89.24%, SEM = 1.27, CI 95% = 86.61, 91.87; left ear: M = 81.72%, SEM
258 = 1.27, CI 95% = 79.09, 84.35)). No interaural differences were noted when Spanish test
259 materials were used (t = -0.29, p = 0.99; right ear: M = 97.40%, SEM = 1.27, CI 95% = 94.77,
260 100.03; left ear: M = 96.88%, SEM = 1.27, CI 95% = 94.25, 99.51). Thus, our results reveal a
261 significant right ear advantage when test materials are presented in the listeners’ non-native
262 language. Post-hoc Tukey analyses also revealed better performance in Spanish than English
263 when materials were presented to the right ear (t = -4.53, p = 0.001) and the left ear (t = -
24 24
264 8.42, p < 0.0001). Although participants’ ability to correctly repeat words when using Spanish
265 test materials was better than when English materials were used, averaged results did not fall
ASSESSING AUDITORY PROCESSING IN BILINGUALS 12
266 outside the normative range (<78% for words presented to the right ear, <77% for words
267 presented to the left ear; Roberts et al., 1994).
268 [Insert Fig. 3 near here]
269 The regression model also revealed a main effect of age on accuracy in recalling
270 dichotic words (F = 6.94, p = 0.02) and an age x test language interaction (F = 11.71 p <
1,22 1,71
272 English worsened with age while performance for test materials presented in their native
273 language of Spanish did not vary.
274 [Insert Fig. 4 near here]
275 Synthetic Sentences
276 Because the majority of participants performed at or near ceiling for the synthetic
277 sentence identification tasks--all but 3 participants performed at ceiling for English test materials
278 while all participants performed at ceiling for Spanish materials—the assumption of normal
279 distribution was violated for this test. Regardless, no significant differences were noted in test
280 language (F = 3.17, p = 0.09), ear (F = 0.35, p = 0.56) or age (F = 3.46, p = 0.08).

281 Discussion
282 By measuring participants’ performance on dichotic digits, dichotic words, and
283 competing sentences tasks, our data revealed two primary findings: (i) that performance on
284 binaural integration and separation tasks varied by language for more challenging tasks and (ii)
285 changes in binaural processing appear as early as mid-life.
286 Performance varied by language for more challenging auditory tasks
287 The first of our primary findings was the significant difference between participant
288 performance on tests that were conducted in their native language (L1) versus their secondary
289 acquired language (L2). Notably, although participants tended to perform better when test
290 materials were presented in Spanish, their performance varied depending on the task.
ASSESSING AUDITORY PROCESSING IN BILINGUALS 13
291 Differences in performance were particularly salient for more challenging auditory tasks with
292 greater linguistic loads (i.e., competing words, dichotic digits). It is likely that no differences
293 between English and Spanish test performance were noted in the synthetic sentence task due
294 to the ease of the task and reduced linguistic load afforded by a closed-set response list
295 (Willeford & Burleigh, 1994).
296 Similar to our findings, Roberts and colleagues (1994) noted poorer performance on
297 dichotic tasks in English for bilingual speakers when compared to monolingual English
298 speakers. When collecting normative data for the Dichotic Words Listening Test in American
299 and Canadian university students, the researchers noted that American students performed
300 significantly better than Canadian students. Further evaluation of this difference led to the
301 conclusion that an individual’s native language acquired before the age of 6 may continue to
302 impact their performance on dichotic listening tasks, particularly dichotic words, well into
303 adulthood if the test materials are presented in their secondary language (i.e., English) (Roberts
304 et al., 1994).
305 These results are further supported by the theory of native language neural commitment
306 (NLNC) which suggests that the learning of a native language creates unique neural pathways
307 that enable the language learner to readily learn patterns and other aspects of the native
308 language (Kuhl, 2004). These NLNC connections also allow the learner to more easily learn
309 other languages with similar linguistic patterns as their native language, but it can be more
310 difficult to learn foreign language patterns and features. The existence of NLNC could then
311 explain the linguistic differences and difficulties that may be experienced by bilingual individuals,
312 as early developed neural connections (in relation to their native language) make it more difficult
313 to understand and acquire the linguistic depths of a second language (Kuhl, 2004). More
314 complex listening tasks having a greater linguistic load, as often used in CAPD assessments,
315 would tax the system more vigorously and be more likely to reveal subtle processing differences
316 resulting from NLNC. This could also explain why our bilingual participants performed better on
ASSESSING AUDITORY PROCESSING IN BILINGUALS 14
317 more complex, dichotic listening tasks when testing was conducted in Spanish rather than
318 English.
319 The relationship between language and performance also suggests that materials
320 presented in an individual’s secondary language may be more taxing and require greater
321 involvement of higher-order cognitive functions than when testing materials are in an individual’s
322 native language. Desjardins and colleagues (2019) investigated similar concepts and found that
323 bilingual speakers are at a notable disadvantage when listening in noise compared to their
324 monolingual counterparts. They explained that listening in noise is a higher function task,
325 requiring higher processing skills and the ability to take advantage of acoustic cues in the
326 environment in order to focus on the desired signal while simultaneously ignoring the presented
327 noise. Given this explanation and what we know about the NLNC (Kuhl, 2004), we would expect
328 that completing complex auditory tasks in a secondary language would be significantly more
329 challenging.
330 Our participants demonstrated better performance in Spanish than English for the
331 dichotic digits task. Although language-specific differences were also noted for dichotic words,
332 differences in dichotic digits task performance were observed in the interaction between test
333 language and ear of presentation rather than solely a main effect of language. The varied
334 results observed across these assessments may be due to slight differences in the tasks.
335 Although the dichotic digits task is thought to be less linguistically loaded than other binaural
336 integration tasks (Bellis, 2011), it taxes auditory memory more due to the number of stimuli that
337 must be retained and recalled following each presentation (Maerlender et al., 2004; Sone &
338 Vidyapeeth, 2018). Dichotic digits tasks using double digit pairs require an individual to recall 4
339 items (2 digits presented simultaneously to each ear) while other tasks (e.g., dichotic words)
340 only require the repetition of 2 items (1 word presented simultaneously to each ear). Thus, it is
341 possible that dichotic digits tasks require greater working memory skills than other assessments
342 of binaural integration, like dichotic words (Brännström et al., 2023; Cameron et al., 2016;
ASSESSING AUDITORY PROCESSING IN BILINGUALS 15
343 Maerlender et al., 2004; Sone & Vidyapeeth, 2018). Further supporting this, our results revealed
344 that better performance on the dichotic digits task was supported by more years of educational
345 training. Indeed, previous work identifies an association between educational level and working
346 memory (Nugroho et al., 2024; Souza-Talarico et al., 2007; Zarantonello et al., 2020). Souza-
347 Talarico et al. (2007) demonstrate that although working memory declines throughout the aging
348 process, higher educational levels mitigated this decline and enhanced working memory
349 capabilities in participants. Even more similar to our findings, Fischer et al. (2017) report better
350 performance on dichotic digits tests in participants who completed more years of formal
351 education.
352 In addition to improved performance in Spanish for dichotic digits, our participants
353 showed an interaural asymmetry when tested in English for the dichotic words test. This
354 interaural difference illustrates better performance for the right ear, also referred to as a right-
355 ear advantage (REA) (Kimura, 1967). An ear advantage is a powerful indicator of hemispheric
356 dominance for language which in this case closely correlates to the anatomically-set neural
357 advantage for stimuli in the right ear to be sent to the left hemisphere and processed more
358 quickly within the left primary auditory cortex. Stimuli presented to the left ear must first travel to
359 the right hemisphere and then crossover to the left hemisphere via the corpus callosum before
360 the speech can be further processed (Geffner & Ross-Swain, 2019; Jerger, 2018).
361 While it is not uncommon to see a REA in typically-developing children, as their brains
362 are still maturing and developing pathways and connections, this advantage normally fades or
363 decreases and the ears “even out” as the brain reaches adolescence (~12 years) (Musiek et al.,
364 1984). It has been suggested that the ear advantage can decrease anywhere from 3% to 9%,
365 depending on the dichotic test, as a child matures from ages 5 to 12 (Moncrieff, 2011).
366 Interaural differences are also not uncommon in individuals with true auditory processing
367 disorders and in some cases are indicative of an auditory processing disorder such as
368 amblyaudia or amblyaudia plus (Moncrieff, 2011). Given that all of our participants were adults
ASSESSING AUDITORY PROCESSING IN BILINGUALS 16
369 with no history of neurological pathologies or auditory processing concerns, we would not
370 expect an ear advantage to be present for our participants. This finding is particularly striking
371 because it only occurred in participants’ secondary language of English whereas no interaural
373 The significant REA observed in the English test condition was seen for the dichotic
374 words test but not the dichotic digits test. One possible reason for this is the varying linguistic
375 load across the tasks (Bellis, 2011). Indeed, more linguistically loaded tasks contribute to
376 greater performance differences between ears and result in a stronger right-ear advantage
377 (Keith, 1984; Willeford & Burleigh, 1994). Our results mirror these previous findings
378 demonstrating significant right-ear advantages on more linguistically loaded tasks (i.e., words)
379 while interaural task performance did not vary for tasks with lighter linguistic loads (i.e., digits).
380 Changes in binaural processing appear as early as mid-life
381 While test-language effects have been studied previously in educational settings in
382 school-aged children (Canz et al., 2021), there is limited evidence for the impact of test
383 language on auditory task performance in adults while also considering the effects of
384 bilingualism and aging on the central auditory system and processing abilities. In the current
385 study, age was found to be a significant factor for binaural integration and separation task
386 performance. Dichotic digits performance revealed more significant interaural asymmetry with
387 increasing age of the participants. Results for the dichotic words test showed poorer
388 performance for L2 test materials with increasing age while performance for L1 test materials
389 remained consistent.
390 For the dichotic digits task, the presence of the right-ear advantage noticeably increased
391 with age in our study participants. Aging has been shown to have a significant effect on dichotic
392 listening ability and it can in fact result in a regression shown by the presence of a right-ear
393 advantage during dichotic listening (Bellis & Wilber, 2001; Fischer et al., 2017; Mukari et al.,
394 2010a; Tawfik & Shafik, 2022). Although participants of these studies were not reported to be
ASSESSING AUDITORY PROCESSING IN BILINGUALS 17
395 bilinguals, results suggest that interaural asymmetry resurges as an individual ages but is not
396 typically observed until mid-adulthood between the ages of 40 and 55. Given that aging
397 influences processing efficiency and the interhemispheric transfer of auditory signals (Bellis &
398 Wilber, 2001; Martin & Jerger, 2005), our results show regression patterns in dichotic listening
399 performance of bilingual adults consistent with previous work (Bellis & Wilber, 2001; Fischer et
400 al., 2017; Mukari et al., 2010b; Tawfik & Shafik, 2022).
401 For dichotic word assessments, performance with test materials presented in
402 participants’ secondary language was poorer for older participants, yet performance for Spanish
403 test materials remained consistent regardless of participant age. This result suggests that a
404 form of regression or increased processing difficulty occurs over time in bilingual speakers for
405 their non-native language. It is possible that age-related performance differences could be
406 attributed to increased cognitive demand when completing complex auditory tasks in a non-
407 native language. Typical aging alters cognitive processing in a number of ways (e.g., slowed
408 processing speed, restricted attention) (Bellis & Wilber, 2001; Salthouse, 1988; Windle et al.,
409 2023). The increased cognitive load associated with typical aging may reduce the cognitive
410 resources available for secondary language processing, thus hindering performance on more
411 challenging auditory tasks (i.e., when assessment materials are presented in L2). This
412 conclusion is consistent with the NLNC hypothesis which suggests that non-native language
413 processing is more effortful (Kuhl, 2004).
414 Clinical Implications and Study Limitations
415 Overall, the findings of this study have significant clinical implications for the assessment
416 of CAPD in bilingual individuals. Our study revealed that performance on dichotic listening tasks
417 varied depending on whether the test materials were presented in the participant’s native or
418 non-native language, even when the individuals were proficient in both languages. This was
419 particularly true for more complex and linguistically loaded tasks. Performance differences were
420 also impacted by the participants’ age. Interaural asymmetries and poorer performance were
ASSESSING AUDITORY PROCESSING IN BILINGUALS 18
421 noted on the dichotic digits and dichotic words tasks, respectively, with increasing age of
422 participants.
423 The American Speech-Language and Hearing Association (ASHA) and the American
424 Academy of Audiology (AAA) specifies that in order for an individual to obtain a CAPD diagnosis
425 they must (i) score at least 2 standard deviations below the mean on two or more tests for at
426 least one ear or (ii) score 3 standard deviations below the mean on one test in at least one ear
427 with significant functional difficulty in auditory behaviors that rely on the process being assessed
428 (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005; Musiek et al., 2010). Considering
429 these specifications and the individual performance of our participants, three would qualify for
430 the diagnosis of CAPD and slightly more than half of our participants would demonstrate an
431 area of auditory processing deficit (i.e., performance below the normative range on at least 1
432 test; n = 13) if only English test materials had been used. Yet, no areas of deficit or dichotic
433 weaknesses were noted with analogous Spanish assessments. This suggests that the
434 differences in performance we observed are due to language processing rather than true
435 auditory processing deficits. Thus, if a clinician relied solely on test materials in a patient’s non-
436 native language, then it is possible they would render an inappropriate CAPD diagnosis. Our
437 results also suggest that performance differences due to language processing become more
438 apparent as an individual ages. Therefore, it is vital that all individuals are assessed in their
439 native language whenever possible, even when they are proficient in English.
440 Although our results have impactful clinical relevance, limitations of the study must also
441 be acknowledged. Firstly, this study only evaluated dichotic skills, specifically binaural
442 integration and separation. However, when completing a CAPD evaluation, best practice
443 recommends including tests that assess all areas of processing (e.g., temporal processing,
445 auditory processing abilities. Because we limited our study to dichotic tasks, the results cannot
446 be generalized to results of a comprehensive CAPD test battery. Future studies could extend
ASSESSING AUDITORY PROCESSING IN BILINGUALS 19
447 this work by evaluating performance in bilingual speakers on other auditory processing skill
448 assessments and include a more challenging sentence task. This would allow us to better
449 understand the impact of linguistic load and context on CAPD in bilingual speakers.
450 Additionally, we attribute differences across dichotic digits and dichotic words
451 performance to working memory capacity. While this conclusion is supported with evidence from
452 previous studies, we did not directly measure working memory in our participants. In future
453 studies, the relationship between working memory in bilingual speakers and binaural listening
454 tasks could be evaluated by incorporating a measure of working memory capacity. Since we
455 also found educational level to be related to dichotic digit performance, it would be interesting to
456 evaluate the potential benefits of continuing education opportunities on working memory and
457 auditory processing skills.
458 Altogether, our study emphasizes the importance of providing patients with the most
459 appropriate testing condition when available. It is always in the patient’s and clinician’s best
460 interest to conduct any form of auditory testing in the patient’s native language. Using materials
461 in a patient’s learned or secondary language could result in an underestimation of the patient’s
462 true auditory processing abilities and an inaccurate diagnosis. In instances when test materials
463 are not available in the patient’s native language, this should be noted in the appointment
464 documentation and the results should be interpreted with caution.

610 Tables and Figures
613 percent correct scores on the dichotic digits task for each test language and ear of presentation
614 is shown. Mean performance is plotted as the shaded diamond in each box. A main effect of
615 language suggests that participants performed better on the dichotic digits task when instructions
616 and test materials were presented in Spanish (i.e., participants’ L1) than English (L2) with
617 performance collapsed across ear of presentation. *p< 0.05, **p< 0.01, ***p< 0.001

621 between performance for each ear of presentation on the dichotic digits task and participant age
622 is depicted. When collapsed across test language, participants’ ability to accurately recall digits
623 (plotted as percent correct scores) presented to their left ear declined with age while right ear
624 performance remained stable. Shaded region: 95% confidence interval for mean predicted

629 of test materials and ear of presentation. Mean performance is plotted as the shaded diamond
630 in each box, and outliers are indicated as unfilled circles or “+”. The significant interaction
631 between test language and ear of presentation indicates that performance differed by ear of
632 presentation such that performance was better in Spanish for each ear. Furthermore, an
