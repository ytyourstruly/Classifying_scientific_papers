26 Abstract
27 The ability to quickly and precisely follow another person’s gaze reflects important
28 evolutionary mechanisms that underlie social interactions, such as attention modulation and
29 prediction of future actions. Recent studies have shown that observers utilize gazer head
30 direction and peripheral information to execute anticipatory saccades toward gaze goals.
31 However, how anticipatory eye movements are influenced by the presence of multiple potential
32 gaze goals, the absence of the gazer and the relative distance between the gazer and gaze goal
33 has not been studied. In this work, we presented dynamic stimuli of gazers moving their heads
34 to look at other individuals (gaze goals) in the scene and instructed observers to search for a
35 target individual. We measured the accuracy of the first saccade end-point in locating the gaze
36 goal. Firstly, we find that the absence of a gazer induces a significantly larger saccade error in
37 estimating the goal location but only when the initial fixation location and the gaze goal location
38 are far from each other (at least 9.07 dva apart). The first saccade’s amplitude and onset latency
39 are significantly higher in gazer-present than in gazer-absent trials. Secondly, when multiple
40 potential gaze goals were present in the visual periphery, the first saccade was directed to the
41 individual closer to the initial fixation increasing the saccade accuracy in fixating closer gaze
42 goals. Finally, we find that multiple potential gaze goals present in the visual periphery shorten
43 saccade latencies and increase the frequency of anticipatory saccades executed prior to the
44 completion of the gazer’s head movement. Taken together, our findings extend the understanding
45 of eye movement control during gaze-following to complex and naturalistic scenarios.

56 INTRODUCTION
57 Visual search is an important perceptual process that is recruited in almost every activity
58 required for an organism’s survival, such as foraging for food, looking for a friend among a
60 nonhuman primates, foveated vision plays a major role in guiding visual search (Bringmann et
61 al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019; Mustari, 2017). Due to the varying spatial detail in visual processing
62 across the visual field (foveated vision), humans rely heavily on eye movements to continually
63 guide the region of the eye that processes information with high visual acuity (the fovea) (see
64 Kowler, 2011 and Spering, 2022 for reviews). Humans make approximately three saccades (fast
65 and ballistic eye movements) in just one second (Gibaldi & Sabatini, 2021; Ibbotson &
66 Krekelberg, 2011). Given their constant necessity in daily tasks, eye movements thus make for
67 an important and easy-to-access measure of human visual and perceptual behavior (Eckstein
68 2017, Huang et al., 2015; Park et al., 2016). The brain undertakes fine-grained computations that
69 incorporate stimulus properties and the foveated nature of the visual system to guide eye
70 movements towards task-relevant visual information in tasks such as reading, visual search,
71 object recognition, and motor actions (Castelhano & Heaven, 2011; Droll et al., 2009; Eckstein
72 et al., 2015; Hayhoe & Ballard, 2005; Legge et al., 1997; Najemnik & Geisler, 2005; Rucci et al.,
73 2007; Schütz, Braun & Gegenfurtner, 2011; Spering, 2022; Spering et al., 2011).
74 In the real world, the human visual system often encounters many stimuli, usually
75 comprising task-relevant and task-irrelevant items. For instance, for a person driving a car, traffic
76 signals and other cars on the road are relevant. However, the same scene can contain task-
77 irrelevant details such as a large and colorful billboard, or a bird sitting atop the traffic signal
78 post. In such scenarios, the visual system has to select the task-relevant regions to attend to by
79 utilizing various cues to guide attentional processing. In the laboratory, studies have
80 demonstrated how observers can utilize predictive cues of a target location to orient and guide
81 covert attention and eye movements (Baek et al., 2021; Carrasco & Yeshurun, 1998; Eckstein,
82 2017; Eckstein et al., 2004, Posner, 1980, Liu et al., 2022; Lu & Dosher, 2000; Luck et al, 1994;
83 Tünnermann & Scharlau, 2015; Zimmer et al, 2022).
84 In the real world, attention towards searched targets is guided by scene context such as a
85 background and objects co-occurring with the target (Torralba, 2006; Neider and Zelinsky, 2006;
86 Castelhano & Heaven, 2011; Võ, 2021; Koehler & Eckstein, 2017; Koehler & Eckstein, 2017).
87 The gaze of another person is also a real-world cue used by observers to orient attention and
88 facilitate search (Driver et al., 1999; Friesen, Ristic, & Kingstone., 2004; Han & Eckstein, 2023;
89 Han & Eckstein, 2022). The ability to follow gaze directions quickly and precisely reflects
90 important evolutionary mechanisms that underlie social interactions, such as attention
91 modulation and prediction of future actions (Frischen, Bayliss, & Tipper, 2007). Although gaze-
92 following is an automatic and reflexive phenomenon (Brooks & Meltzoff, 2005; Shepherd, 2010,
93 Wallis et al., 2015), the mechanisms behind how the brain achieves this quick and accurate
94 inferential response are still not well understood.
95 Most previous gaze perception and gaze-following studies have used static images of
96 faces or cartoon drawings of faces as gaze cues (Driver et al., 1999; Friesen, Ristic, &
97 Kingstone., 2004) and have found that gaze cues indeed orient attention as measured by a
98 reduction in reaction time when the target appears on the cued side. Driver et al. (1999) also
99 showed that gaze cues, although presented centrally, reflexively orient observer’s attention,
100 similar to how uninformative peripheral box (exogenous) cues in a Posner cueing paradigm
101 would (Posner, 1980). Other similarities between gaze-cueing and reflexive peripheral-cueing
102 have been reported, such as both gaze-cueing and peripheral-cueing elicit an inhibition at longer
103 SOAs (stimulus onset asynchrony) (Frischen & Tipper, 2004). Thus, gaze cues, while presented
104 centrally, show cueing effects similar to peripheral exogenous cueing, leading the scientific
105 community to believe that gaze is a special cue owing to its biological significance. However,
106 studies employing a central arrow cue as another symbolic and learned-directional cue showed
107 similarities in results with those of gaze-cueing and peripheral cueing studies (Hommel et al,
108 2001; Shepherd, 1986). However, gaze-cues have been found to be more strongly reflexive than
109 arrow cues in that attention shifts were reflexive to the gaze-cued location whereas only
110 volitionally for the arrow-cued condition (Friesen et al., 2004).
111 In contrast to exogenous cueing, however, gaze cues have been shown to have a slower
112 rise in facilitation effects as well as a delayed onset of IOR (Frischen & Tipper, 2004). Again,
113 Murray et al., (2023) reported gaze-cueing effects that were most similar to a ‘hybrid’ of
114 exogenous and endogenous attentional orientation. Several studies in humans and macaques also
115 suggest an initial reflexive orientation by gaze cues only later followed by a more top-down,
116 volitional guidance. For instance, Hayward & Ristic (2013) showed that when combining
117 counterpredictive gaze cues with a memory load manipulation, the initial attention allocation was
118 unaffected by memory load but was later affected in the endogenously controlled attention
119 reallocation stage. Ramenzanpour and Fallah (2022) also show an early reflexive orientation in
120 response to gaze cues which is subject to volitional control at longer SOAs.
121 Studies of gaze-cueing have typically used static images of faces and/or eyes as an
122 operationalization of gaze. However, the real world is dynamic, and especially so for the
123 perception of gaze. For instance, Farroni et al. (2000) showed that infants do not follow eye gaze
124 if presented statically but do so only when there is apparent motion. In this study, we aimed to
125 use eye movements with dynamic stimuli as a window to the inferential mechanisms used by the
126 brain to perform gaze following. We investigate gaze-following behavior while observers search
127 for a target individual in a scene. We used videos of real-world scenes with or without people
128 displaying gazing behavior at other individuals (gaze goals) present in the scene. A previous
129 study has used similar dynamic and real-world stimuli and found that observers use the gazer’s
130 head direction and peripheral information about potential gaze goals to execute anticipatory
131 saccadic eye movements (Han & Eckstein, 2023). Specifically, even before the gazer finishes
132 orienting their head, the observers already start eye movements towards the gazed location.
133 The previous study (Han & Eckstein, 2023) only investigated simpler images with a
134 single or no gaze goal. However, real-world scenes can contain multiple potential gaze goals
135 that could appear at various distances from the gazer. For example, our friend might turn their
136 head at a dinner party and there might be many other guests along that direction making the final
137 gaze goal ambiguous. In addition, the previous study evaluated the contribution of the peripheral
138 gaze goal information to the observers’ saccades but did not manipulate the presence of the gazer
139 on saccades. Our goal is to probe further into the anticipatory eye movements made by
140 participants and assess the influence of the gazer's presence, the number of potential gaze goals,
141 and the gazer-to-goal distance on the gaze-following eye movements. Participants in the study
142 were instructed to watch these videos while searching for a specific target person. Thus, without
143 explicit instructions to follow the gaze of the gazer individuals in the videos, participants simply
144 looked for a specific person, closely resembling a real-life scenario, while we measured their eye
145 movements. We hypothesized that the observer’s saccade dynamics would align with the gazing
146 behavior shown in the stimuli, such that the presence of a gazer would result in slower saccade
147 onsets (as observers would take the additional time to process the information in the gazer) and
148 more accurate estimations of the goal location.
149 In addition, we included a condition in which multiple possible goal individuals appeared
150 in the absence or presence of a gazer. This allows us to explore how the brain programs eye
151 movements in response to gaze cues while searching in an environment with added uncertainty
152 about the target’s location. We hypothesized that the presence of more than one gaze goal will
153 increase uncertainty which will impact the anticipatory nature of eye movement planning and
154 saccade end-point errors (Renninger, Verghese, & Coughlan, 2007). .
155 METHOD
156 Participants
157 The materials and procedures used in this study were approved by the University of
158 California Internal Review Board. Thirty undergraduate students (nine males, twenty-one
159 females, aged: 18-23 (19.67 ± 1.27) years) from the University of California were recruited to
160 participate in the experiment for research credits. All participants signed a consent form to
161 provide informed consent to participate in the study. Participants were right-handed and had
162 normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
163 Materials
164 Twenty-four unique in-house videos were used to create the stimuli for this study. The
165 videos were recorded at the University of California, Santa Barbara in different indoor and
166 outdoor settings (classrooms, cafeterias, outdoor campus, etc.). Each video contained multiple
167 people. During filming, verbal instructions were given to one of the actors in the scene to look at
168 another person. For the experiment, the videos were edited to begin when the gazer individual
169 starts moving their head and end once the gazer finally stops their head movement to look at the
170 gazed person that could either be the target or a distractor. The videos in the gazer absent
171 condition were the same ones except the videos were digitally edited to remove the gazer
172 individuals and replace them with the scene background pixels. Thus, both gazer absent and
173 gazer present counterparts of a given video had the exact same duration. There was one target
174 person throughout the study: the person the observers were instructed to search for during the
175 experimental task. All other individuals in the videos besides the target person and the gazer
176 individual are referred to as distractors. Further, the individual that the gazer was instructed to
177 look at during the filming of the videos is referred to as the "gaze goal", and all other individuals
179 were filmed on different days and in different settings, and as such, the target and distractor
180 individuals appeared in different clothing and at varying distances from the gazer in each video.
181 The gazer person could change across video clips. The average distance between the gazer and
182 gaze goal across all trials in the study was 9.07 ± 3.85 degrees of visual angle (dva).
185 Terms used to define the experimental role of people in the videos and dependent variables
186 analyzed in this study. In this image, the gaze goal is a distractor and the non-gaze-goal is the
187 target.
188 To create the stimuli from the above videos, first, twenty-four videos were reflected
189 along the vertical axis to generate a total of 48 videos. There were three main conditions in the
190 study: gaze goal absent, one gaze goal, and two potential gaze goals. The original videos had
191 three individuals (gazer, gaze goal, and non-gaze goal). To create the goal absent condition, the
192 gaze goal and non-gaze-goal individuals were digitally erased using Adobe Premiere Pro by
193 replacing the RGB values of the individuals with those of the background. The one gaze goal
194 condition was created by digitally removing the non-gaze-goal from each video. For the two
195 potential gaze goals condition, we had 6 videos in which the target individual was the gaze goal
196 and the non-gaze-goal was a distractor. We created 6 more videos from the aforementioned
197 videos by digitally swapping the target and distractor locations. This was done to allow us to
198 compare eye movement features between trials in which the target individual appeared as the
199 gaze goal and those where the target was the non-gaze-goal, while all other features of the
202 trials, 48 "one gaze goal" trials wherein the target individual was the gaze goal in 12 of the
203 videos and the remaining 36 videos had a distractor individual as the gaze goal, and 48 "two
204 potential gaze goals" trials wherein 6 videos had the target individual as the gaze goal, 6 others
205 had the target individual as the non-gaze-goal, and 36 videos had distractors as both gaze goal
206 and non-gaze-goal. This was done to maintain a 25% prevalence rate of the target individual in
207 both the one gaze goal and the two potential gaze goal conditions.
208 Further, the gazer absent condition was created by digitally erasing the gazer individuals
209 from each of the videos used on the gazer present condition. Thus, the gazer absent condition had
211 goal and non-gaze-goal individuals are referred to as the goal and non-goal individuals for the
212 gazer absent counterparts henceforth. Hence, in total, there were 48 (original videos) × 3 (goal
213 condition: none, one goal, and two potential goals) × 2 (gazer condition: absent and present) =
214 288 total stimuli videos (trials).
218 The flowchart shows the experimental conditions of this study. Further subdivisions of the "two
221 All videos were presented at the center of an Acer monitor with 1920 × 1080 resolution
222 subtending a visual angle of 31.5◦× 19◦ (width × height). The observers were seated at 980 cm
223 from the monitor with their chins resting on a headrest while they watched the videos (0.017 dva
224 per pixel). Each observer’s right eye was tracked using a video-based eye tracker (SR Research
225 Eyelink 1000 plus desktop mount) at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. A validation and calibration
226 procedure were carried out using a 9 × 9 grid mandatorily at the start of every block as well as at
227 the start of a trial if the recorded eye position was > 1.5 dva away from the actual fixation
228 location. Eye-movement events with velocity higher than 30◦/s and acceleration higher than
229 8000◦/s2 were recorded as saccades.
230 Design
231 The study was a within-subjects design with two main conditions: gazer absent and gazer
232 present, each of which had the same three sub-conditions: no gaze goal, one gaze goal, and two
233 potential gaze goals. To be clear, we refer to the conditions in terms of gaze goals, although for
234 the gazer absent condition, the goals are present without the gazer. The target individual was
235 present, either as the gaze goal or the non-gaze-goal in 25% of all gaze goal present trials. The
237 goal, distractor as non-gaze-goal, B. distractor as gaze goal, target as non-gaze-goal, and C.
238 distractors as both gaze goal and non-gaze-goal.
239 Thus, the independent variables (IVs) in the study are the following: A. Presence of
240 gazer, B. Distance between initial fixation and gaze goal location, C. Identity of gaze goal (target
241 vs distractor), D. Number of potential gaze goals (none vs one vs two). In addition, there were
242 two further sub-conditions for the two potential gaze goals condition: A. gaze goal closer to
244 and B. non-gaze-goal closer to initial fixation (which is also the gazer location in gazer present
246 The dependent variables (DVs) analyzed are as follows: A. Euclidean error in the first
247 saccade end-point, B. Angular error in the first saccade end-point, C. Amplitude of the first
248 saccade, C. Onset latency of the first saccade, D. gazer head direction at the time of first saccade
249 onset (as a measure of anticipation of gaze direction by the first saccade).
252 Sub-conditions of the Two Potential Gaze Goals condition (G - gazer, T - target, D - distractor):
253 a. Goal target and closer; non-goal distractor and farther (G TD), b. Goal target and farther;
254 non-goal distractor and closer (G DT), c. Goal distractor and closer; non-goal target and
255 farther (G DT), d. Goal distractor and farther, non-goal target and closer (G TD), e. Goal and

257 (G D1D2).
D2
259 The dependent variables (DVs) in the study were the following: A. First saccade end-
260 point error, defined as the Euclidean distance between the actual gaze goal location and the
261 landing point of the first saccade, B. First saccade angular error, defined as the angular
262 displacement between the first saccade vector and the initial fixation (or gazer in gazer present
264 1). Specifically for gazer present trials, we also analyzed the gazer-head angular error at the time
265 of initiation of the first saccade as a function of the number of potential gaze goals in the trial, as
266 a measure of the observer’s anticipation of the gazer’s final head direction.
267 Procedure
268 The study was carried out over two different days with an intervening period of one week
269 between the two days. Observers were presented only with either gazer absent or gazer present
270 trials on a given day. The order in which observers saw gazer absent and gazer present blocks
271 was randomized across observers, such that 15 observers completed the gazer absent trials on the
272 first day (and the gazer present trials on the second day), whereas the other 15 observers
273 completed the gazer present trials on the first day. On visual inspection of the data, there were no
274 differences in any of the dependent variables as a function of the order in which the conditions
275 were presented, thus, we report our findings after combining data across all 30 observers.
276 On the first day, the participants gave informed consent. Observers were instructed to
277 search for a specific target person in all the trials. They were not explicitly instructed to follow
278 the gazer’s direction of gaze. Participants completed 6 blocks of 24 trials (144 trials in total)
279 each on a given day. At the start of each block, the participant’s conducted the eye tracker
280 calibration and validation procedure. Two images of the target person they would be searching
281 for were displayed in between trials. Before the very first block, participants completed a
282 practice block of 4 trials comprising videos separate from the ones shown in the main
283 experimental blocks. Next, the main experiment started with the first block of 24 trials. At the
284 start of each trial, a fixation cross appeared on the screen over a grey image at the same location
285 where the gazer’s head would appear in a gazer present trial. Participants were required to fixate
286 on the cross and if the recorded eye position was > 1.5 dva away from the center of the fixation
287 cross, participants were required to re-calibrate and re-validate the eye tracker. Once the fixation
288 check was passed, participants were shown the video trial which started at the frame in which the
289 gazer’s head movement started. The video ended at the frame in which the gazer’s head
290 movement stopped at the final gaze direction. On average, the duration of the stimuli videos was
291 1.18s ± 0.32 s. After a trial ended, participants were presented with a response screen with a
292 response wheel of numbers 1 through 10. They were instructed to click on a number between 1
293 and 5 if they thought the target was absent (1 being highly certain and 5 being highly uncertain)
294 or to click on a number between 6 and 10 if they thought the target person was present (6 being
295 highly uncertain and 10 being highly certain). Once the participants responded, the display
296 moved on to the next trial which again started with a fixation cross. Participants completed 24
297 trials in each of the 6 blocks and returned on the next day to complete another 6 blocks of 24
298 trials each. The procedure remained the same on the second day except they did not complete
302 Experiment Paradigm. Each trial started with a forced fixation that would display the gazer’s
303 head in gazer-present trials after 500 ms, after which the trial started for variable duration (1.18
304 ± 0.32 s), at the end of which the observers were presented with a self-paced response screen of
305 a wheel marked 1 through 10 (1-5: target absent, 6-10: target present, 1 and 10 being highly
306 confident choices and 5 and 6 being highly uncertain choices), following which the screen moved
307 on to the next trial. Each participant completed 144 trials (6 blocks of 24 trials) on two different
308 days a week apart, thus completing 288 trials in total.
310 Human-estimated gaze information
311 One analysis of interest is to understand the inherent information in the gazer-head
312 direction at the time of the observer’s saccade initiations. To estimate the gazer-head angular
313 error (relative to the gaze goal) as a function of time/video frame, a separate group of 13 research
314 assistants (who had never seen the videos before) annotated each video frame to localize where
315 they thought the gazer was looking at. The videos only contained the gazers with all other
316 individuals in the videos digitally erased. This allowed to isolate gaze direction information
317 inherent in the gazer’s head direction from peripheral information about potential gaze-goals .
318 The frames of each video were presented in a randomized order to observers to minimize
319 sequential dependencies. The gazer vector for each frame was averaged across the 13 annotators.
320 Statistical analysis
321 We analyzed only those saccades that were > 2 dva in amplitude (98% of all data) from
322 the initial fixation location (or the gazer location in gazer present trials). Saccades with
323 amplitudes smaller than 2 dva were considered refixations on the gazer.
324 We used the non-parametric bootstrap techniques to estimate the statistical significance
325 of the differences observed in our dependent variables. The bootstrap procedure accounted for
326 observer and video variability. We resampled the 30 subject IDs with replacement and then also
327 resampled the stimulus IDs (videos) with replacement for gazer absent vs gazer present
328 comparisons. We then computed the mean difference in the DV per stimulus ID per subject of
329 the bootstrap samples. For all other comparisons involving different sets of stimuli (such as
330 between target present vs distractor present), we only resampled the 30 subject IDs with
331 replacement and resampled the stimuli IDs with replacement separately for each condition. For
332 each subject, we computed the mean DV for each condition across the respective bootstrapped
333 stimulus IDs and finally computed the mean difference of the DV between the conditions being
334 compared. All statistical analyses involved 10,000 times bootstrapped samples.
336 RESULTS
340 The difference in first saccade end-point error between gazer absent and gazer present trials as
341 a function of the distance from initial fixation to the goal location for goal (target/distractor)
342 absent trials. Each point is a unique video used as a stimulus in the experiment. The error bars
343 represent the standard error of the mean across 30 participants. The red dotted line indicates the
344 mean distance between the initial fixation and goal location. Spearman correlation statistics are
345 reported.
347 The Presence of a Gazer Reduces the First Saccade End-Point Error but Only When the Goal
348 is Far from the Initial Fixation Location
350 We defined the first saccade error as the distance between the goal location and the first
351 saccade end-point. We assessed the influence of the presence of a gazer on the observers’ first
352 saccade error (Δ first saccade error = first saccade error with gazer – first saccade error without
353 gazer) and how it varied with the distance between the observers’ initial fixation and the goal
354 location.
355 We observed that the benefit of the gazer’s presence on the first saccade error increased
356 with the distance between the the initial location and goal location (Spearman’s rank correlation
358 closer (< 9.07 dva), the first saccade error was lower when the gazer was absent vs. present.
359 Whereas, when the initial fixation and the goal location was farther apart (>= 9.07), the presence
360 of the gazer reduced the first saccade error.
362 showing the heatmaps of all participants’ first saccade end-points for an example trial when the
363 goal location was far (6a and 6c) or close (6b and 6d) to the initial fixation (examples are for
366 to the goal location across all trials comprising different video stimuli. The same videos were
367 presented in both gazer present and gazer absent versions and the first saccade end-point
368 distributions are shown in green and red, respectively. The distributions of the spread in first
369 saccade end-points is higher when the goal is located more than 9.07 dva away from the initial
370 fixation (gazer) location, irrespective of the identity of the goal as target or distractor. Further,
371 the presence of a gazer also decreases the spread of the distribution of the first saccade end-
372 points.
375 Example trials with the distribution of first saccade end-points across all participants showing
376 the presence of the gazer reduces the first saccade error only when the gaze goal is far (>=9.07
377 dva) from the observer’s initial fixation location: a. gazer present and gazer-to-target distance is
378 high (>=9.07 dva), b. gazer present and gazer-to-target distance is low (<9.07 dva), c. gazer
379 absent and initial-fixation-to-target distance is high (>=9.07 dva), d. gazer absent and initial-
380 fixation-to-target distance is low (<9.07 dva)
384 First saccade end-point distribution registered to goal locations across all trials (gazer absent vs
385 gazer present): a. Goal is the target and initial-fixation-to-target distance is low, b. Goal is the
386 target and the initial-fixation-to-target distance is high, c. Goal is a distractor and initial-
387 fixation-to-distractor distance is low, d. Goal is distractor and initial-fixation-to-distractor
388 distance is high. The color bars indicate the proportion of data in a given contour.
390 To quantify the effect of the presence of the gazer in guiding saccade dynamics during a
391 search task, we analyzed two measures of the first saccade for trials in which a goal was present:
392 1. the first saccade Euclidean error as the Euclidean distance between the first saccade end-point
394 between the vector joining the initial fixation and true goal location and the vector joining the
395 initial fixation (goal) and the first saccade end-point). We compared these measures across gaze
396 absent and gaze present conditions.
399 First Saccade End-Point Euclidean and Angular Error: a. First saccade end-point
400 Euclidean error when goal is the target, b. First saccade end-point Euclidean error when goal is
401 a distractor, c. First saccade end-point angular error when goal is the target, d. First saccade
402 end-point angular error when goal is a distractor. The error bars denote the standard error of
403 the mean. We normalize the angular error, such that 0° indicates the true direction of the goal
404 from the initial fixation (gazer) location, and -180°/180° indicates the opposite direction and
405 compute the average of the magnitude of the angular error for statistical analyses

411 We ran bootstrap analyses followed by false-discovery rate (FDR) correction to quantify
412 the statistical significance of any difference observed in the saccade measures between the
413 different conditions. The first saccade end-point Euclidean error was significantly higher for
414 gazer absent than for gazer present condition both when the goal was the target (4.34 dva vs 3.71
415 dva, bootstrap p <.001, Cohen’s d = .19, FDR-corrected) as well as when the goal was a
416 distractor (4.47 dva vs 4.18 dva, bootstrap p = .012, Cohen’s d = .08, FDR-corrected), but only
417 when the initial-fixation and goal locations were at least 9.07 dva apart. A similar effect was
418 observed when the initial fixation and goal locations were closer than 9.07 dva to each other, but
419 the differences did not reach significance either when the goal was the target or when the goal
421 when the initial-fixation-to-goal distance was higher than 9.07 dva, for the gazer present
422 condition both when the goal was the target and when the goal was a distractor, as well as for the

432 target (6.29° vs 4.51°, bootstrap p = .008, Cohen’s d = .3, FDR-corrected) or a distractor (7.99°
433 vs 5.8°, bootstrap p < .001, Cohen’s d = .28, FDR-corrected), but only when the initial-fixation

438 The Presence of a Gazer Elicits Slower and Higher Amplitude First Saccades
439 Across all conditions, including those in which no goal was present, we compare two

457 First, for both gazer absent and gazer present conditions, when the goal was either the
458 target or distractor, the first saccade amplitude was significantly larger when the goal was
460 Next, we found that the first saccade amplitude was significantly larger when the gazer
461 was present rather than absent for conditions in which the goal was the target located more than
462 9.07 dva distance from the initial fixation (gazer) location (10.7 dva vs 10.07 dva, bootstrap p <
463 .001, Cohen’s d = .23, FDR-corrected) as well as when there were no goals (9.7 dva vs 7.56 dva,
464 bootstrap p < .001, Cohen’s d = .62, FDR-corrected). The influence of the gazer on saccade
465 amplitude did not reach significance when the distractor was the goal.
466 The first saccade amplitude was higher, but not significant, when the gazer was present
467 and the goal was a distractor located at distances >= 9.07 dva from the initial fixation location
469 the first saccade amplitude for the gazer present condition was not significantly larger than the
470 gazer absent condition. However, when a distractor was present closer to the initial fixation

476 Gazer influence on the first saccade onset latency (ms)
477 The presence of the gazer increased the first saccade onset latency across all conditions
479 when no peripheral goals were present than when one or more goals were present (for both gazer
481 The findings are consistent with the interpretations that the presence of the dynamic gazer
482 at the initial fixation location requires that observers take additional time to process the foveal
483 visual information resulting in increased first saccade onset latencies.
485 The Presence of Two Potential Goals in the Periphery Elicits Larger Error in the First
486 Saccade
487 We had included the “two potential goals” trial type to emulate real-world scenarios more
488 closely: it rarely happens that we search for one specific person in an otherwise empty
489 background. We separated the one goal and two potential goals to explore how gaze-following
491 maps of the distribution of the first saccade end-points of all participants in specific example
492 trials. For the two potential goals trial type we created pairs of videos where the target and a
493 distractor were spatially swapped. Thus, in one video the target person was the gaze goal while
494 the distractor was the non-gaze-goal. In the corresponding video with the digital swap, the
495 distractor was the gaze goal and the target was the non-gaze-goal. This digital manipulation
498 first at the individual closer to the initial fixation (gazer) location irrespective of whether that
499 person is the goal or the target, and irrespective of whether a gazer is absent or present. This is
500 analyzed in further detail in the next subsection.
505 Example trials with the distribution of first saccade end-points across all participants showing
506 the tendency of observers to look at the closer individual first when two potential gaze goals are
507 present: a. gazer is present with one goal, b. gazer is present with two potential goals and the
508 goal is located farther from the gazer than the non-goal, c. gazer is present with two potential
509 goals, and the goal is located closer to the gazer than the non-goal, d. gazer is absent with one
510 goal, e. gazer is absent with two potential goals and the goal is located farther from the gazer
511 than the non-goal, f. gazer is absent with two potential goals and the goal is located closer to the
512 gazer than the non-goal
515 to the goal locations separated by the number of potential goals present, the presence of the
516 gazer, and the type of the goal (target/distractor). Irrespective of whether the gazer is absent or
517 present and whether the goal is the target or a distractor, the first saccade end-points have a
518 larger spread in the presence of two potential goals than when only one goal is present.
522 First saccade end-point distribution registered to goal locations across all trials (One Goal vs
523 Two Potential Goals): a. gazer present with the target as the goal, b. gazer present with a
524 distractor as the goal, c. gazer absent with the target as the goal d. gazer is absent with a
525 distractor as the goal. The color bars indicate the proportion of data in a given contour.
527 To quantify the effect of multiple potential goals in the search task, we compared the first
528 saccade end-point Euclidean error between one and two potential goals. as well as between the
529 gazer absent and gazer present conditions. We found that the presence of two potential goals
530 elicits a significantly larger error in the first saccade as compared to when only one goal was
531 present, irrespective of whether a gazer was present and whether the goal was a target or a

544 In addition, we found that when only one goal (target or distractor) is present, the
545 presence of the gazer reduces the first saccade error (goal target: 2.75 dva vs 2.05 dva, bootstrap
546 p < .001, Cohen’s d = .27, FDR-corrected; goal distractor: 2.11 dva vs 1.81 dva, bootstrap p =

549 The First Saccade Lands at the Individual Closer to the Initial Fixation When Two Potential
550 Goals Are Present
551 Next, we assessed the first saccade end-point when two potential goals were present in
553 observer’s first saccade usually lands at the individual closer to the initial fixation (gazer)
554 location regardless of whether that individual is the target, a distractor, the goal or the non-goal
556 points registered to the goal locations for trials with two potential goals, wherein the goal was
557 either closer or farther than the non-goal to the gazer. Across all conditions, the first saccade end-
558 points have a larger spread when the goal is farther than when it is closer. Additionally, when the
559 goal is farther, the first saccade end-point distribution shows two modes, near the location of the
560 non-goal that is closer to the initial fixation (gazer) location either to the left or right of the goal
566 First saccade end-point distribution registered to goal locations across all trials consisting of
567 two potential goals (Goal Closer vs Goal Farther): a. gazer present, goal is the target, non-goal
568 is a distractor, b. gazer absent, goal is the target, non-goal is a distractor, c. gazer present, goal
569 is a distractor, non-goal is the target, d. gazer absent, goal is a distractor, non-goal is the target,
570 e. gazer present, goal is a distractor, non-goal is a distractor, f. gazer absent, goal is a
571 distractor, non-goal is a distractor. The black diamonds indicate the average location of the non-
572 goal to the left and right of the goal location in trials where the non-goal is closer to the initial
573 fixation (gazer) location. The color bars indicate the proportion of data in a given contour.
575 To further quantify the observed differences in the first saccade end-point distributions
576 between trials in which the goal is closer and those in which the goal is farther, we analyzed the
577 first saccade end-point Euclidean error. The first saccade Euclidean error is significantly larger
578 when the goal is farther from and the non-goal is closer to the initial fixation (gazer) location,
579 regardless of the identity of the goal and the non-goal and whether the gazer is present or not

593 Comparisons between “gaze goal closer” vs “gaze goal farther” conditions for the first saccade
594 end-point Euclidean error (dva)
596 In addition, we found that, for the trials in which both goal and non-goal were distractors,
597 the first saccade end-point error for the gazer absent condition is significantly larger than the
598 gazer present condition when the goal is closer to the initial fixation (gazer) location than the
599 non-goal (2.7 dva vs 2.19 dva, bootstrap p < .001, Cohen’s d = 0.19, FDR-corrected). However,
600 the error for the gazer present condition is significantly larger than the gazer absent condition
601 when the goal is farther from the initial fixation (gazer) location than the non-goal (6.25 dva vs
602 5.68 dva, bootstrap p = .012, Cohen’s d = 0.16, FDR-corrected).
604 Observer’s First Saccades Anticipate the Gazer’s Head Direction
605 For this analysis, we used only those trials in which a gazer was present. Using the
606 annotations made by 13 research assistants who did not participate in the study in a procedure
607 described in the methods section, we estimated the gazer’s head direction at the time of initiation
609 time of initiation of the first saccade whereas the orange lines are the first saccade vectors.
611 final gazer’s head direction angle (labeled as 0). The gaze location estimation by the 13
612 annotators varied with a mean standard error of 0.9 dva in the x-direction and 0.3 dva in the y-
613 direction.
615 We found that in the absence of any gaze-goal, the mean gazer head direction at the time
616 of the first saccade initiation is 48.63° away from the goal direction. When only one gaze-goal is
617 present, the mean gazer head direction at the time of the first saccade initiation is 62.62°. Finally,
618 when two potential gaze-goals are present, the mean gazer head direction at the time of the first
619 saccade initiation is 69.11°. In other words, on average, the observers’ first saccades anticipate
620 the gazer’s head movement by 100 ms in the absence of any gaze-goals, by 394 ms in the
621 presence of one gaze-goal, and by 426 ms in the presence of two potential gaze-goals. While the
622 anticipation is much higher in the presence of one or more individuals in the periphery, bootstrap
623 statistics show that the anticipation of the gazer’s head direction is significantly larger when two
624 potential gaze-goals are present than when no gaze-goals are present (426 ms vs 100 ms,

645 DISCUSSION
646 We analyzed eye movement dynamics of observers as they completed a visual search
647 task in the presence or absence of gaze cues within dynamic and naturalistic stimuli. Using our
648 current study design, we were able to study the effects of various interacting elements in a
649 naturalistic scene, such as the presence of a foveal gazer, the presence of one or more peripheral
650 individuals, and the relative spatial orientation of these individuals, to unravel how the brain
651 integrates this information and exploits spatial relationships to finally guide eye movement
652 behavior during visual search.
654 Gazer Guides Observers’ First Saccade When the Goal is Far from Initial Fixation
655 We found that the presence of a gazer reduces first saccade end-point error, but only
656 when the gazer and goal are located far from each other. Our experiment was designed to enforce
657 the observer’s initial fixation at the gazer’s head (or the background for gazer absent trials) when
658 the trial starts. We found that the first saccade onset latency is higher for gazer present than for
659 gazer absent trials. This is evident because observers spend more time processing the information
660 in the gazer’s head which is then used to guide the dynamics of the saccade they will eventually
661 make. Moreover, the amplitude of the first saccade is also affected by the presence of the gazer.
662 When a gazer is present the first saccade amplitude is significantly larger than when a gazer is
663 absent. Observers make a longer saccade toward the gazed direction when they have the gazer
664 information available. On the contrary, observers show shorter first saccades in the absence of
665 the gazer, resulting in higher first saccade end-point errors when the initial fixation and goal
666 locations are farther apart.
667 Gaze cues have been known to be powerful in orienting attention toward the gazed
668 direction (Driver et al., 1999; Friesen, Ristic, & Kingstone., 2004). Our study adds to existing
669 knowledge by showing that observers plan slower and longer saccades during search when gazer
670 information is available and utilizes this information to guide saccades more efficiently towards
671 the gazed location. This effect is more pronounced when the gazer and the gazed location are
672 situated farther apart in which case the first saccade end-point error increases in the absence of a
673 gazer. When the initial fixation and goal location are near each other, observers can use only the
674 peripheral information to program the saccade end-point location.
675 Together, these findings show that the human brain can integrate foveal and peripheral
676 information (Kroell & Rolfs, 2022; Liang et al., 2023; Ludwig et al., 2014; see Stewart et al.,
677 2020 for a review) during visual search to efficiently plan saccade dynamics especially when the
678 initial fixation and the goal are located at larger distances from each other.
680 Uncertainty About Goal Location Increases First Saccade End-Point Error
681 We found that when there are two potential goals in a trial, that is when there is increased
682 uncertainty about the goal location, the first saccade end-point error is significantly larger than
683 when there is only one (certain) goal location. We probed further and found that this increase in
684 error is a consequence of the observer’s strategy to fixate the individual closer to the initial
685 fixation (gazer) location first, regardless of whether that person is the goal or the target
686 individual. In other words, when the non-goal is closer to the initial fixation (gazer) location, the
687 observer makes the first saccade to the non-goal thereby leading to an increased distance
688 between the first saccade end-point and the goal location than when the goal was present closer
690 the non-goal individuals located closer to the initial fixation).
691 These findings can be explained in the light of a cost minimization strategy: when there
692 are multiple possible locations to scan to find the target, one approach may be to program eye
693 movements to each location by starting with the one that is closest to the previous fixation
694 location (Araujo, Kowler, & Pavel et al., 2001; Kowler, 2011).
695 Previous studies have related features of first saccades to stimulus-level uncertainties in
696 visual tasks such as during visual search. These studies (Beutter et al., 2003, Droll et al., 2009,
697 Eckstein et al., 2001, Findlay, 1997; Shimozaki et al., 2012) showed that changes in location
698 uncertainty and stimulus features result in corresponding changes in first saccade latencies and
699 lower accuracy. These results support the intricate link between location uncertainty, perceptual
700 processes and motor planning. In addition, previous studies have shown evidence for changes in
701 eye movement velocity as a function of expected temporal and spatial uncertainties
702 (Boutachkourt et al., 2024) and have reported slower saccade latencies in the face of spatial
703 unpredictability of target appearance (Dickov & Morrison, 2006).
704 Our findings add to the existing understanding of the uncertainty (possible gaze goals)
705 that underlie saccade planning during visual search in the context of a more ecological task
706 encountered by the visual system in the real world.
708 Observer’s First Saccades Anticipate Gazer’s Head Movement
709 Finally, we found that observers anticipate the gazer’s head direction with their first
710 saccade. More specifically, the observer’s first saccade predicts the final head direction of the
711 gazer before the gazer finishes their head movement by 100-426 ms. This anticipation was
712 present even in the absence of a goal but was more prominent when there were one or more goals
713 present in the periphery. Han and Eckstein (2023) also made a similar observation and our study
714 adds to this by showing that the anticipation of gaze is present even when there is more than one
715 potential goal in the visual periphery. Further, the anticipation of the gazer’s head is more when
716 there is greater uncertainty. Anticipatory saccades have also been found to be involved in motor
717 action planning (Hayhoe & Ballard, 2005; Hayhoe et al., 2003). It is known that eye movements
718 precede some types of motor actions, such as while reaching for objects or to pick up objects and
719 place them elsewhere (Schütz, Braun & Gegenfurtner, 2011; Spering, 2022; Spering et al.,
720 2011). “Look ahead” fixations have also been reported by Pelz and Canosa (2001) in the context
721 of hand-washing action. In light of the temporal constraints on eye movement planning, our
722 findings on anticipatory saccades suggest that the brain uses available information in an efficient
723 manner to plan goal driven eye movements.
724 Importantly, the direction in which the first saccade is made is more accurate than the
725 direction in which the gazer’s head was directed at the time of the first saccade initiation. This
726 suggests that the brain integrates information from the periphery with the foveal gazer
727 information to predict the gaze direction. Thus, the more available information is in the
728 periphery, the greater the anticipation of the gazer’s head movement in the observer’s first
729 saccade.
730 Taken together, this study increases our understanding of the fine-scaled temporal
731 dynamics of eye movement programming during visual search with gaze following across
732 conditions with varying levels of uncertainty and gaze information and provides evidence that
733 the brain uses information-theoretic principles to plan eye movement strategies.
