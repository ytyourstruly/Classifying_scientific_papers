ABSTRACT
The perirhinal (PrC) and anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alErC) are among the first brain
regions affected by Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Yet, their precise cognitive role remains
unclear. Recent models propose that these regions support episodic familiarity and lifetime
familiarity in tasks requiring fine conceptual discrimination. Evidence in aging and AD is
however lacking. We assessed episodic (Task 1) and lifetime familiarity judgments (Task 2)
using materials with varying levels of conceptual overlap and lifetime familiarity for targets
and lures (Task 3) in normal and pathological aging. Fifty-eight older adults (aged 55+),
including healthy individuals and patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment or Subjective
Cognitive Decline, completed familiarity tasks. PrC and alErC volumes were measured via
high-resolution MRI and correlated with tasks performance. The PrC and alErC volumes were
linked with both episodic and lifetime familiarity, but only when fine conceptual discrimination
was needed. Exploratory cluster analysis identified three subgroups: one composed of healthy
individuals, another including majoritarily patients with memory impairment, and a third, more
heterogeneous group, potentially representing early cognitive decline. The latter group relied
on familiarity to compensate for impaired recollection but committed more false alarms and
showed reduced accuracy as conceptual overlap increased. The results support the role of the
PrC/alErC in mediating familiarity for fine representations. We also discuss how combining
tasks that assess different aspects of familiarity could help identify early cognitive decline and
suggest that this approach should be tested in patients with amyloid biomarkers of AD.

1. Introduction
The perirhinal cortex (PrC), corresponding to Brodmann areas BA35 and BA36, and the antero-
lateral part of the entorhinal cortex (alErC), are among the first brain regions to be affected by
the neuropathology of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) (Braak & Braak, 1991; Braak, & Del Tredici,
2015). However, the precise role of these regions in cognition remains unclear. Clarifying their
role could refine diagnostic tools, crucial for early AD detection.
A strong line of research suggests that the PrC supports familiarity, i.e., an acontextual
sense of prior exposure in episodic memory (e.g., Bowles et al., 2010; Despouy et al., 2019;
Yang et al., 2023; Yonelinas, 2002). In this line, familiarity may represent the earliest subtle
episodic memory impairment in preclinical AD (Bastin et al., 2021; Wolk et al., 2013).
However, studies on familiarity in AD showed mixed results, with nearly equal number of
studies indicating impaired or preserved familiarity in early AD and Mild Cognitive
Impairment (MCI) (Schoemaker et al., 2014).
Meanwhile, recent models of semantic memory suggest the PrC plays a role in
conceptual processing, particularly in fine representation of overlapping concepts (Bruffaerts
et al., 2019; Clarke, 2020; Clarke & Tyler, 2015). While episodic memory impairment is a
hallmark of AD, early semantic memory deficits are also reported in MCI (Joubert et al., 2021),
though their nature remains controversial (Flanagan et al., 2013).
Most studies of semantic memory in AD have focused on naming impairments, with
fewer examining fine conceptual representation (Frick et al., 2023). One study found that
distinctive object features (e.g., a zebra's stripes) are more vulnerable to disruption than shared
features (e.g., having four legs) as they correlate with naming ability (Garrard et al., 2005). The
loss of distinctive features has been replicated in multiple studies (Flanagan et al., 2013;
Laisney et al., 2011), and likely causes confusion between closely related concepts (Taylor et
al., 2011; Kivisaari et al., 2013). A study comparing AD patients and controls on a conceptual
matching task showed that the sensitivity to conceptual confusability was specifically
associated with left BA36 volume in AD patients, suggesting that PrC alterations impacted the
ability to disambiguate conceptually similar items. (Frick et al., 2023).
One model further proposed the PrC as a hub linking episodic and semantic memory
(Miyashita, 2019). Supporting this, studies have identified correspondences in patterns of PrC
activity for episodic familiarity and cumulative lifetime familiarity of object concepts (Bowles
et al., 2016). For instance, fMRI studies reveal increased PrC activation with greater lifetime
familiarity, alongside typical decreases for recent episodic familiarity (Duke et al., 2017; Yang
et al., 2023). Additionally, a patient with a lesion affecting the left PrC showed impairments in
both lifetime familiarity, especially for high-overlap object concepts (Bowles et al., 2016), and
episodic familiarity (Köhler & Martin, 2020). However, no evidence of such dissociation was
shown in MCI patients with presumed AD-related pathology in the PrC (Anderson et al., 2021).
Yet, the role of conceptual similarity in lifetime familiarity remains underexplored in these
patients.
While inconsistencies between studies as to the integrity of familiarity have been partly
attributed to differences in materials and tasks (Koen & Yonelinas, 2014), we suggest that
conceptual overlap may be a key factor influencing findings on the preservation or impairment
of familiarity in AD. Indeed, recent work distinguished the representational and
phenomenological dimensions of familiarity, with the idea that familiarity would stem from
the PrC signals specifically when relying on fine-grained representations (Gardette et al.,
2024). In addition, lifetime and episodic familiarity may interact, as shown by the influence of
lifetime familiarity on associative memory tasks. Older participants are more prone to false
alarms with distractors involving frequent associations, relying on prior knowledge (Delhaye,
Foville, et al., 2019).
The present study assessed episodic (tasks 1 and 3) and lifetime familiarity (task 2)
across three tasks, manipulating conceptual overlap between object concepts (task 3), in 58
older participants (>55 years) including healthy controls, patients with MCI, and individuals
with Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD; Jessen et al., 2014). The mixed group ensured
variability in PrC and alErC integrity for correlational analyses. We hypothesized that episodic
and lifetime familiarity performance would decline with reduced PrC and alErC volumes,
especially in tasks requiring discrimination of highly overlapping concepts.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
The sample size was estimated a priori using G∗Power 3.1 (Faul et al., 2007). Based on
Delhaye, Besson et al. (2024), a linear regression of left transentorhinal (PrC and alErC)
volume on discrimination task scores showed an effect size of R2 = .127 (corresponding to f2
= 0.1454). To detect a similar effect with α=.05 and 80% power, 57 participants were required.
We also verified that this sample size was sufficient for the within-subjects repeated measures
ANOVA planned for task 3 (2x2x2), using MorePower 6.0.4 (Campbell & Thompson, 2012),
which recommended a minimum of 56 participants.
We recruited 71 adults aged >55 years, excluding 13 due to missing neuroimaging data,
were French-speaking. Thirty-seven had no memory complaints, 7 had SCD (Jessen et al.,
2014), and 14 were diagnosed with MCI at the Memory Clinics of the University Hospital of
Liège. Participants with memory complaints or deficits were included to increase variability in
memory scores and brain atrophy. None met criteria for dementia or had a history of
neurological disorders. The study followed the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) guidelines and
was approved by the Liège CHU Ethics Committee. All participants provided written informed
consent.
2.2. Procedure
Participants completed three sessions: a brief neuropsychological assessment, three
experimental tasks assessing familiarity, and an MRI scan. Sessions two and three could be
conducted on the same day if convenient, but the session order remained consistent.
2.3. Neuropsychological assessment
Participants underwent a brief neuropsychological assessment to characterize their cognitive
participants, who had undergone extensive evaluation in another study, to reduce demands in
this hard-to-recruit population.

2.4. Experimental tasks
The study included three tasks (Fig. 1) administered in a fixed order. Task 1 assessed episodic
familiarity using pseudowords. Task 2 evaluated lifetime familiarity of word concepts. Task 3
examined both lifetime and episodic familiarity, including their potential additive effects,
especially during fine conceptual discrimination.
Fig. 1. Illustration of the experimental procedures for the three tasks assessing familiarity
processes.
2.4.1. Task 1: Assessment of episodic familiarity
We created 120 pseudowords (60 targets and 60 lures), ensuring they were not real
French words or related to famous brands or companies. Each target was paired with a lure
matched for length, diphones, and digraphs.
During an incidental encoding phase, participants viewed 60 pseudowords on the screen for
1.5 seconds each, with a 1-second inter-stimulus interval. Half pseudowords were shown once,
and half were shown three times, creating two levels of episodic familiarity for a later forced-
choice recognition task. Participants read the pseudowords, knowing some would repeat. For
pseudowords shown three times, repetitions were spaced by 20–40 random intervening stimuli.
Several task versions were designed to counterbalance pseudoword status (target or lure) and
presentation frequency (one or three times).
After the encoding phase, there was a 2-minute pause before participants began a
forced-choice recognition task. Each pseudoword from encoding was shown alongside its
associated lure, with randomized order and counterbalanced left/right presentation. Participants
selected the pseudoword they had seen during encoding by pressing the corresponding arrow
key (left or right). The forced-choice modality was chosen to promote familiarity-based
recognition in aging (Bastin et al., 2003). After each recognition, participants indicated their
strategy: pressing “R” for recollection, “T” for guess, or rating their familiarity on a scale from
1 (“barely familiar”) to 9 (“very familiar”). Recollection was defined as remembering specific
details from when the item was seen, while familiarity was the sense of having seen the item
without recalling specifics. Participants were instructed to use "guess" only for items that felt
unfamiliar. Instructions were clarified with examples, and participants were asked to rephrase
them to ensure understanding. The familiarity scale helped participants distinguish varying
phenomenological intensities of familiarity (Gardette et al., 2024).
2.4.2. Task 2: Assessment of lifetime familiarity
For tasks 2 and 3, we selected 160 object labels from McRae et al.'s (2005) normative database
of object concepts and translated them into French. These labels formed 80 concept pairs: 80
labels were used in task 2, and were to-be-recognized targets in a forced-choice recognition
test in task 3, while their paired label (from the same category) served as lures. All items were
from the "living things" category since they are more conceptually confusable (Clarke &
Tayler, 2015).
During task 2, participants rated their lifetime familiarity with 80 concept labels on a
9-point scale (1 = "barely familiar," 9 = "extremely familiar"). Familiarity referred to
encounters with the concept, not recognition of the word. Each stimulus was preceded by a 0.5-
second fixation cross.
2.4.3. Task 3: Assessment of the integrity of both lifetime and episodic familiarity, and
possibly their additive effects
Task 2 served as incidental encoding for task 3, a forced-choice recognition task. Participants
identified which item from each target-lure pair was seen in task 2 and indicated their
recognition strategy: "R" for recollection, "T" for guessing, or a familiarity rating from 1
("barely familiar") to 9 ("very familiar").
The stimuli consisted of 80 object-label pairs divided into two sub-conditions (40 pairs
each) based on conceptual overlap (above or below the median), measured by cosine similarity
values from McRae et al. (2005).
In addition, items were categorized as either highly familiar (e.g., apple) or relatively
unfamiliar (e.g., iguana) based on their normative lifetime familiarity ratings from a pilot
study1.
Each subgroup was further split into four conditions based on target and lure lifetime
familiarity (high/low compared to median, 10 pairs per condition), creating a 2x2x2 repeated-
measures design: conceptual overlap (high/low) × target familiarity (high/low) × lure
familiarity (high/low). Each condition was assigned an abbreviation code, such as LH_H
(Target*Lure_Overlap). This example represents a low (L) target familiarity, high (H) lure
familiarity, and high (H) conceptual overlap between the target and lure. Examples of pairs
A pilot study (n = 16 young healthy volunteers, M = 29.29 years old) validated the materials and normative
ratings for a French-speaking population. High inter-rater reliability was observed for both the first set of 112
items (Crombach’s alpha = .91, 95%CI [.88, .93]) and the second set of 110 items (Crombach’s alpha = .95,
95%CI [.94, .97]).

2.5. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition
Images were acquired using a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner with a 64-channel head coil. Two
anatomical images were collected: a T1-weighted MRI (240 x 256 x 224 matrix, 1 x 1 x 1 mm³
voxel size) and a T2-weighted MRI (448 x 448 x 60 matrix, 0.4 x 0.4 x 1.2 mm³ voxel size)
covering the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in an oblique coronal orientation perpendicular to
the long axis of the hippocampus. Participants were instructed to remain still during the scan
to reduce motion artifacts. Image quality was visually assessed, and if poor, a second T2 (n=4)
or T1 (n=1) scan was performed. The best-quality image was used for further processing.
2.6. Analyses
2.6.1. MRI volume segmentation
High-resolution T2-MRIs were labeled using the ASHS software and the "Penn Memory
Center 3T ASHS Atlas" from the NITRC repository (Yushkevich et al., 2015). Hippocampal
subfields (CA1, CA2, CA3, subiculum, dentate gyrus), ErC, BA35, BA36, and PhC were
labeled bilaterally. Visual quality control identified two participants with poor segmentation,
and their data were excluded. ErC and PrC volumes were normalized by dividing by the product
of slice count and thickness. Regional volumes were further adjusted for total intracranial
volume (ICV) using the formula: Volume = Volume – β (ICV – ICV ), with
adjusted raw ICV indiv mean
β derived from prior research (e.g., Delhaye et al., 2019; Yeung et al., 2017).
The ErC was manually divided into anterolateral (alErC) and posteromedial (pmErC)
regions based on T2 image resolution following established criteria (Olsen et al., 2017). Two
raters (AS and ED) segmented the regions, with AS re-segmenting 7 scans for inter-rater
reliability, yielding an ICC of .869 (95% CI [.651, .955]). Intra-rater reliability was assessed
1,1
by AS re-segmenting 5 scans after 2 months, resulting in an ICC of .986 (95% CI [.946,
3,1
.997]). Spatial overlap, measured using the Dice coefficient, showed excellent agreement:
intra-rater values were .980 (left alErC) and .979 (right alErC), and inter-rater values were
.975 (left alErC) and .965 (right alErC), which are consistent with prior studies (Besson et al.,
2020; Olsen et al., 2017).
2.6.2. Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were conducted using JASP (v0.19), except for the correlation matrix,
computed with SciPy Stats in Python 3. Analyses were performed on the entire sample, but see
our exploratory cluster analysis for exploration of group differences.
2.6.2.1. Task 1
This task aimed to provide a “pure” measure of episodic familiarity, without pre-experimental
lifetime familiarity. We predicted that the percentage of correct responses (across all trials,
regardless of judgment type) would be higher for pseudowords presented three times compared
to those shown once. This increased accuracy should correlate with the volume of the alERC,
BA35, and BA36. The hypothesis was tested using repeated measures ANCOVA with brain
region volumes (left and right alERC, pmERC, BA35, BA36, CA1, CA3 hippocampal
subfields) as covariates, along with age to control for aging effects.
We used the Wilcoxon ranked-test to examine differences in the occurrences of
recollection, familiarity, and guess responses in task 1. We also tested differences in familiarity
responses on false alarms depending on pseudoword presentation frequency. Familiarity
strength ratings were not analyzed due to uneven distribution across levels, resulting in
insufficient data for meaningful statistical analysis.
2.6.2.2. Task 2
Inspired by Bowles et al. (2016), we analyzed the adequacy of the pattern of lifetime familiarity
judgments of our participants with the ones from the pilot study1, which we considered as
normative due to the high inter-rater agreement. We calculated Pearson correlations for each
participant’s familiarity ratings (1-9 scale) with the pilot sample's average ratings, then applied
Fisher transformation to the rho-values to obtain Z-scores, correcting for the skewed
distribution of rho-values for further analysis.
The Z-scores were expected to correlate with the volume of the left alERC, BA35, and
BA36 (Bowles et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2023). These relationships were assessed using
stepwise regression, including the same covariates as in task 1.
2.6.2.3. Task 3
The percentage of correct responses was calculated for each participant and condition. We used
a 2 (target-lure conceptual overlap: high, low) x 2 (target familiarity: high, low) x 2 (lure
familiarity: high, low) repeated measures ANOVA to compare performance across conditions.
We then computed a mixed ANCOVA with the same covariates as in task 1: age, and
the left and right CA1, CA3, alERC, pmERC, BA35, and BA36. We expected the ANCOVA
to reveal an influence of the left alERC, BA35, and BA36 on performance, depending on
conceptual overlap and lifetime familiarity, linking both episodic and lifetime familiarity.
Percentages of recollection, familiarity, and guess responses were not analyzed due to
the high reliance on recollection and low use of familiarity and guess options (Fig. 4B).
Familiarity strength ratings were also not explored due to uneven distribution, resulting in
insufficient data for statistical analysis. However, the lack of familiarity judgments does not
preclude studying its representational dimension (Gardette et al., 2024).
For further investigation, we calculated two indices: the first measures how conceptual
overlap between the target and lure influenced performance, and the second reflects the impact
of the lifetime familiarity difference between the target and lure on memory accuracy. Both
indices were computed using point-biserial correlations between correct responses (1 or 0) and
either conceptual overlap or the lifetime familiarity difference (target minus lure). Fisher
transformation was applied to the rho-values for statistical analysis. Stepwise regression was
then conducted on the Z-scores (Z and Z ), including the same covariates as the
overlap diff_fam
mixed ANCOVA.
2.6.2.4. Across tasks analyses
Spearman correlations were computed between performance across the three familiarity tasks
using individual correct response percentages for items presented once and three times in task
1, the Z-score from task 2, and correct response percentages for each of the eight subconditions
in task 3. Given that both episodic and lifetime familiarity likely depend on PrC integrity, we
expected positive correlations and computed one-tailed correlations. P-values were corrected
for multiple comparisons using False Discovery Rate (FDR) (Benjamini & Hochberg, 2000).
We conducted an exploratory clustering analysis on scores from the three tasks to
identify response patterns that might reveal subgroups within the sample and distinguish
patients from healthy controls. Given the heterogeneous sample and unequal group sizes
(healthy controls, MCI, SCD), traditional statistical group comparisons were unsuitable.
Instead, we applied k-means clustering (Hartigan-Wong algorithm in JASP) with the number
of clusters determined using the elbow method optimized for the lowest Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC). Variables included aimed to capture diverse performance aspects: recognition
accuracy, counts of recollection, familiarity, guess responses, and familiarity-based false
alarms, separately for items presented once and three times from task 1, the Z-score from task
2, and Z and Z scores from task 3.
overlap diff_fam
Using our heterogeneous sample of healthy controls, MCI, and SCD patients, we then
diagnoses/groups as rows, to assess if response patterns from the familiarity tasks aligned with
MCI diagnoses and subjective memory complaints. We conducted two Kruskal-Wallis
ANOVAs to test for differences in MoCA scores and age across clusters.
3. Results
Cognitive status was assessed using the MoCA, with scores available for 55 participants,
ranging from 19 to 30 (M = 26.29, SD = 2.68). The score distribution (Appendices A) confirmed
a wide range of cognitive abilities, aligning with our goal to include participants with potential
varying MTL integrity as prior research links MoCA score to transentorhinal (alERC and
BA35) volume (Olsen et al., 2017; Yeung et al., 2021).
3.1. Task 1: Episodic familiarity for pseudowords
Memory accuracy (percentage of correct responses) was significantly higher for pseudowords
presented three times compared to once (F(1,54) = 91.66, η2 = .63, p < .001) (Fig. 2A).
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed that presentation frequency (one or three times)
significantly influenced the use of recollection (W = 26, r = -.96, p < .001), familiarity (W =
867.5, r = .36, p = .03), and guess responses (W = 1162, r = .98, p < .001) (Fig. 2B). Familiarity
responses on false alarms were significantly more frequent for pseudowords presented once
than three times (W = 787, r = .92, p < .001).

confidence intervals (CI95%) showing the percentage of items for which participants used

Including age and brain region volumes (left and right CA1, CA3, BA35, BA36, pmERC, and
alERC) as covariates in the repeated measures ANCOVA revealed no significant effects on
memory accuracy or interactions with pseudoword presentation frequency.
3.2. Task 2: Lifetime familiarity
With a sample including both patients and healthy older participants, we expected variability
in correlations between individual lifetime familiarity judgments and those of the normative
sample, particularly in MCI patients. This variability is shown in Fig. 3. The Z-score standard
deviation was .27, with no participant showing a negative correlation.

correlations between familiarity judgements from the participants (each line represents a
participant) and those from the normative sample; B) Histogram of the Pearson correlation
values between familiarity judgements from the participants and those from the normative
pilot study. The correlations are plotted before their Fisher transformation into z-scores.
Forward stepwise linear regression analyses found no MTL subregion volumes
significantly explaining variability in lifetime familiarity judgments (Z-scores).
3.3. Task 3: Episodic and lifetime familiarity
The repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of target familiarity, with
better performance for highly familiar targets (F(1,54) = 22.87, η2 = .30, p < .001), and a
significant main effect of target-lure conceptual overlap, with better performance for low
overlap (F(1,54) = 5.44, η2 = .09, p = .02). Conceptual overlap significantly interacted with
target familiarity (F(1,54) = 6.93, η2 = .11, p = .01) and lure familiarity (F(1,54) = 4.80, η2
p p
= .08, p = .03), with a significant triple interaction (F(1,54) = 4.62, η2 = .08, p = .04). Neither
the main effect of lure familiarity (F(1,54) = 1.71, η2 = .03, p = .20), nor the interaction
between target and lure’s level of familiarity (F(1,54) = .73, η2 = .01, p = .40) was significant
(Fig. 4).

responses for the different conditions independantly of response accuracy. L: low, H: high
(Target-Lure, e.g., LH: target with low familiarity and lure with high familiarity), R:

After adding MTL subregion volumes and age as covariates in the repeated-measures
ANCOVA, no brain volume significantly explained variance in memory accuracy (p > .05).
However, significant triple interactions were found between lure familiarity, target-lure
conceptual overlap, and the volumes of the left alERC (F(1,41) = 7.80, η2 = 0.16, p = .008)
and left BA36 (F(1,41) = 7.44, η2 = .15, p = .009), indicating the volume of these regions
modulate the influence of overlap and lure familiarity on memory accuracy. Additionally, a
significant triple interaction emerged between target familiarity, lure familiarity, and right
pmERC volume (F(1,41) = 4.4, η2 = .10, p = .04), and a double interaction between lure
familiarity and right CA1 volume volume (F(1,41) = 5.03, η2 = .11, p = .03). Other interactions
were not significant (p > .05). Full results are in Appendices B.
The stepwise linear regression on Z and MTL subregion volumes revealed no
overlap
significant predictors. However, for Z scores, the best model included exclusively the
diff_fam
right CA1 subfield volume.
3.4. Correlations between performance across tasks
Spearman correlations between performance on the different familiarity tasks (Correlation
Matrix in Fig. 5) revealed no significant correlation between recognition accuracy for items
presented once in task 1 (purest measure of episodic familiarity we have) and Z-scores from

accuracy for items presented three times in task 1 (supposedly stronger episodic familiarity)
and Z-scores from task 2 was significant, r = .24, p = .04.
Memory accuracy for items presented once in task 1 significantly correlated with two
subconditions of task 3 (LL_H: r = .25, p = .03; HL_L: r = .28, p = .02), but not with others.
Memory accuracy for items presented three times in task 1 significantly correlated with all
subconditions of task 3 (HH_H: r = .33, p = .007; HL_H: r = .50, p < .001; LH_H: r = .47, p <
.001; LL_H: r = .48, p < .001; HH_L: r = .42, p < .001; HL_L: r = .49, p < .001; LH_L: r =

Significant correlations were found between Z-scores from task 2 and performance on

3.5. Clustering analysis based on performance across tasks
The k-means clustering model was performed on 53 participants with complete data, excluding
two who achieved 100% accuracy on all task 3 subconditions. The elbow method suggested 3
clusters (Appendices C). The model showed a R2 = .41. Cluster 1 contained 15 participants,
Cluster 2 had 29, and Cluster 3 included 9 participants. See Fig. 6 for cluster means and
densities across variables.
- Qualitatively, participants in Cluster 1 showed average memory accuracy in task 1 but
used recollection less, relying more on familiarity judgments, including erroneous ones for
false alarms. These patterns were similar for pseudowords presented once or three times.
In task 2, their lifetime familiarity adequacy was average, and in task 3, their memory
accuracy had a slightly stronger negative correlation with target-lure conceptual overlap
compared to the other clusters.
- Cluster 2 participants had the highest memory accuracy in task 1 and used recollection the
most. Their lifetime familiarity in task 2 was average. In task 3, their memory accuracy
showed a slightly stronger positive correlation with target-lure overlap, indicating a better
ability to distinguish closely related concepts.
- Cluster 3 had the lowest memory accuracy in task 1, using fewer recollection and
familiarity judgments, and relying more on guessing. They showed the poorest lifetime
familiarity adequacy (task 2) and their memory accuracy in task 3 was most influenced by
the familiarity difference between target and lure.
The MoCA score significantly differed between clusters (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA: H(2) =
17.68, η2 = .34 , p < .001). Post-hoc tests showed Cluster 2 had higher scores than Cluster 1
(t=-3.10, p = .007) and Cluster 3 (t=5.34, p < .001), while Cluster 1 scored higher than Cluster
3 ((t=2.68, p = .01). Average scores were 22.57 for Cluster 3, 25.29 for Cluster 1, and 27.5 for
Cluster 2. No significant age differences were found between clusters (Kruskal-Wallis
ANOVA: H(2) = .24, η2 = .004 , p = .89).
The Chi-Squared test between clusters and initial diagnoses was significant, χ²(4) = 11.87, p =
Cluster 3 mainly included MCI and SCD patients (78%), while Cluster 1 was more
heterogeneous, with 47% healthy participants and 53% patients.

4. Discussion
This study aimed to better understand familiarity impairments linked to PrC and alErC
alterations, such as those seen in pathological aging and preclinical AD (Braak & Braak, 1991).
We designed three behavioral tasks to test models suggesting that the PrC connects episodic
and semantic memory (Miyashita, 2019) and helps differentiate overlapping concepts (Clarke
& Tyler, 2015). Previous studies supported PrC's role in both episodic and lifetime familiarity,
especially for closely related concepts (Duke et al., 2017; Bowles et al., 2016). However, one
MCI study did not find lifetime familiarity impairments, questioning PrC involvement
(Anderson et al., 2021), though conceptual overlap wasn't tested. Here, we investigated whether
reduced PrC volume in healthy older adults and memory-impaired patients relates to
diminished performance in episodic and semantic familiarity, especially in the presence of
conceptual overlap, assuming that PrC supports fine-grained representations underlying
familiarity (Gardette et al., 2024).
4.1. Behavioral modulations of familiarity
Memory accuracy was higher for pseudowords presented three times compared to once (task
1), indicating better performance with slightly increased episodic familiarity. In task 3,
participants recognized targets better when they had high lifetime familiarity and were paired
with low-familiarity lures, but only when there was high conceptual overlap. For low
conceptual overlap, memory accuracy was not significantly affected by the familiarity of the
target or lure. Lifetime familiarity seems to interact with episodic familiarity when conceptual
overlap is high and discrimination demands are increased. Interestingly, performance on task
2 (lifetime familiarity) significantly correlated with the subconditions from task 3 that involved
targets of high lifetime familiarity, i.e., when lifetime familiarity contributed to accuracy.
Similarly, performance on task 2 positively correlated with recognition accuracy for items
presented three times in task 1 (episodic familiarity). Despite efforts to focus on familiarity,
the high rates of recollection responses in tasks 1 and 3 suggest that the tasks did not capture
familiarity in its purest form, particularly in its phenomenological aspect. Assessing
recognition based solely on familiarity, without recollection, remains challenging (Anderson
et al., 2021; Besson et al., 2015; Gardette et al., 2024). While isolating items with familiarity
responses was not feasible due to insufficient data, our results still shed light on the
representations underlying familiarity. Measuring lifetime familiarity also remains difficult, as
it cannot be scored objectively. Following previous work (Bowles et al., 2016), we estimated
performance through correlations with familiarity scores from young controls.
In addition to memory accuracy however, our exploratory clustering analysis also
considered recollection, familiarity, guesses, and familiarity on false alarms. This analysis
identified three subgroups: Cluster 2, with higher memory accuracy, mostly comprised healthy
older participants (79%); Cluster 3, with the lowest memory accuracy, mainly included SCD
or MCI patients (78%); and Cluster 1, which had a mix of SCD, MCI, and healthy participants.
Participants in Cluster 1 showed average memory accuracy but used less recollection and more
familiarity responses, suggesting they rely on familiarity to compensate for impaired
recollection, as seen in previous MCI studies (Bastin et al., 2003; Westerberg et al., 2006).
They also used familiarity on false alarms more often, echoing findings that MCI patients with
increased false recognitions are more likely to develop AD (Bastin et al., 2021). Although their
lifetime familiarity adequacy on task 2 was average, Cluster 1’s performance in task 3 was
more negatively affected by conceptual overlap, supporting our hypothesis that early PrC
neuropathology impairs familiarity specifically when it involves discrimination between
conceptually similar items. Cluster 1 showed milder impairment compared to Cluster 3, who
had the worst accuracy and used more Guess responses. Cluster 3 also showed lower lifetime
familiarity adequacy on task 2.
In favor of the assumption that the three clusters might partly distinguish between
clinical subgroups, MoCA scores differed between clusters, attesting to their different level of
cognitive impairment. Although exploratory, these clustering results provide insights into
cognitive task design for detecting preclinical cognitive decline. Recent research shows that
older adults have more difficulty distinguishing semantically similar verbal memory traces
(Ilyés et al., 2024), and Cluster 1’s MoCA score (25.29 ± 2.97) aligns with those of participants
in that study (25.95 ± 2.01). In this line, our results distinguish Cluster 1 from Cluster 2
(healthier) and Cluster 3 (more impaired), highlighting the potential of our task combination to
identify early cognitive decline. Yet, this hypothesis should be confirmed by future group
studies including patients with AD diagnosis at prodromal stage based on biomarkers (Jack et
al., 2024).
4.2. Relation with MTL subregions structural integrity
In task 3, our results showed that the volumes of the left alErC and left BA36 interacted
significantly with the lure's lifetime familiarity and the conceptual overlap between the target
and lure. Performance was lower when the lure had high lifetime familiarity and high
conceptual overlap. However, when the lure had low lifetime familiarity in the presence of high
overlap, performance was similar to conditions with low overlap. This supports theories
suggesting that these regions are involved in discriminating closely related concepts (Clarke &
Tyler, 2015) and that the PrC plays a role in familiarity when fine conceptual discrimination is
needed (Bastin & Delhaye, 2023; Bowles et al., 2016).
No significant modulation of memory performance in task 1 (episodic familiarity) or
task 2 (lifetime familiarity) was observed in relation to these brain regions. In other words, we
did not show evidence linking PrC integrity to episodic or lifetime familiarity as such, but our
results suggest that the PrC supports representations underlying familiarity when fine
conceptual discrimination is required. Although previous functional MRI studies have shown
PrC involvement in familiarity (Duke et al., 2017), brain volumes from structural MRI may be
less sensitive. Variations in MTL segmentation methods (Yushkevich et al., 2015) and the need
for more refined delineation of MTL subregions (Mazloum-Farzaghi et al., 2024) may also
limit volumetric precision. Additionally, the small inter-individual variability in PrC volumes
in our sample may have hindered detection, unlike case studies with extensive PrC damage
(Bowles et al., 2016).
In task 3, we found a significant interaction between lure familiarity and right CA1
volume. Given the established role of CA1 in episodic memory formation and recall (Bartsch
et al., 2011), this result, together with the high “remember” response rates, suggest that
recollection processes may be involved when lure lifetime familiarity is high. This is supported
by prior research indicating that lure familiarity affects episodic recognition in aging (Delhaye,
Folville, et al., 2019). While preserved recollection may aid in target-lure discrimination,
diminished recollection and weaker retrieval processes could lead to false alarms due to high
lure familiarity.
Intriguingly, we also report a significant triple interaction between right pmErC volume
and both target and lure familiarity. Although the role of the pmErC in cognition is less
understood, the “posterior medial, anterior temporal” (PMAT) model (Ritchey et al., 2015)
suggests it is involved in memory for contextual information. Yeung et al. (2021) found that
pmErC volume was positively correlated with story memory but not with visual memory,
supporting its role in contextual recall. Our results suggest the pmErC modulates recognition
performance, particularly when both the lure and target have high lifetime familiarity. This
aligns with prior work indicating the involvement of the pmErC in distinguishing items based
on episodic memory.
Theoretically, the finding that PrC and alErC volumes were significantly associated
with recognition performance only when the task required discrimination of overlapping
concepts supports the role of the PrC in familiarity for fine-grained representations. This aligns
with recent views proposing that different stimuli and representations may evoke familiarity
through distinct neural correlates (Gardette et al., 2024), and that the subjective feeling of
familiarity may be independent of its representational dimensions.
4.3. Future perspectives
Although our tasks did not assess familiarity processes as purely as expected, exploratory
behavioral clustering across tasks highlighted the potential of combining familiarity-related
tasks to detect subtle cognitive changes linked to PrC and alErC integrity. Future studies with
larger samples could further explore differences in PrC and alErC volumes between subgroups
and assess the sensitivity and specificity of these tasks in identifying preclinical AD. A follow-
up after 2 years would help determine if patients with profiles similar to Cluster 1 are more
likely to progress to AD, providing a better understanding of the predictive value of these tasks.
