DISINHIBITION IN DAILY LIFE 2
Abstract
Disinhibition is a personality trait with broad health implications and has been included in
several prominent models of maladaptive personality traits and psychopathology, such as the
DSM-5 Alternative Model of Personality Disorders, the Hierarchical Taxonomy of
Psychopathology. Cross-sectional global self-report and clinical interview research suggest that
disinhibition has a tight link with interpersonal problems, particularly antagonistic problems.
However, very little work has examined how individual differences in disinhibition manifest in
interpersonal functioning in social situations in daily life. We examined how trait disinhibition
and its lower-level facets (e.g., Irresponsibility, Impulsivity, Distractibility) relate to ecological
momentary assessments of interpersonal interactions in daily life across three samples (Total
Person N = 1,068, Total Observation N = 38,212). Results showed a consistent and positive
association between trait disinhibition and negative affect in daily life, above and beyond the
effect of trait antagonism, as well as negative association with warmth during social interactions.
These findings have implications for the manifestation of disinhibition in daily life and the
relationship between externalizing and internalizing psychopathology.

An Exploratory Study on Disinhibition and Interpersonal Outcomes in Daily Life
Disinhibition is a broad dispositional trait that refers to an individual’s tendency to
behave impulsively, take risks, seek out novel and exciting experiences, and lack perseverance
towards goals (Dindo et al., 2009). It has far-reaching implications for mental and physical
health (Mullins-Sweatt et al., 2019; Schweren et al., 2021). Indeed, impulsiveness, the behavioral
manifestation of disinhibition, is the most common symptom across diagnoses in the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association [APA],
2013; Cyders, 2015). Moreover, disinhibition has been included explicitly as part of the higher-
order constructs in the DSM-5 Alternative Model of Personality Disorders (AMPD; APA, 2013)
and as a higher-order spectrum (i.e., Disinhibited Externalizing) in the Hierarchical Taxonomy of
Psychopathology (HiTOP; Kotov et al., 2017). Research within each of these frameworks has
suggested a privileged link between disinhibition and some forms of social dysfunction,
particularly antagonism. At the same time, much of this research has examined associations
among individual differences using global, cross-sectional measures of disinhibition and
interpersonal functioning. Despite the large body of work investigating the relationship between
externalizing psychopathology and, in particular, disinhibition with interpersonal behavior, little
is known about how individuals high in disinhibition behave in social situations in daily life. The
current study was designed to investigate the links between individual differences in the domain
and facets of disinhibition and social perceptions, behavior, and emotions as they manifest in
social interactions using ambulatory assessment methods.
From the perspective of structural models of psychopathology, the domains of
disinhibition and antagonism, which together make up the broader externalizing spectrum in
several frameworks, are correlated domains (metanalytic r = .27; Ringwald et al., 2023).
DISINHIBITION IN DAILY LIFE 4
Antagonism is primarily an interpersonal construct and is associated with antisocial behavior,
callousness, low trust, hostility, and poor emotion recognition abilities, all of which are
associated with interpersonal dysfunction (e.g., Vize et al., 2022; da Costa et al., 2018). In the
DSM-5 AMPD, the detachment and antagonism domains correlate similarly in the original
derivation sample (r = .24; Krueger et al., 2012) and follow up analyses (e.g., r = .26; Wright et
al., 2012). However, as scale scores (i.e., not latent variables) these associations are typically
much larger (e.g., rs = .46-.65; Ringwald et al., 2023).
Associations among disinhibition scales and measures of interpersonal problems are also
moderate to strong. For instance, as conceptualized through the Interpersonal Circumplex
framework (IPC; Wiggins, 1991), PID-5 disinhibition has been associated with diffuse or
nonspecific interpersonal impairment and distress in some studies (e.g., Williams & Simms,
2016; Boudreaux et al., 2018) as well as specifically being associated with a cold and dominant
interpersonal problems profile in others (e.g., vindictive; Wright et al., 2012). Of note, these
studies also examined the association between interpersonal problems and disinhibition facets of
the PID-5 (i.e., Irresponsibility, Impulsivity, Distractibility, Rigid perfectionism, Risk taking
[Boudreaux et al. did not include data on Rigid perfectionism and Risk taking]). Results varied
somewhat across studies. For instance, Wright and colleagues (2012) found prototypically
vindictive interpersonal problem profiles for Irresponsibility, and a prototypically Domineering
profile for Impulsivity and Risk Taking, but that the remaining facets of Distractibility and Rigid
Perfectionism were only associated with interpersonal distress, not a specific style of problems.
Williams and Simms (2016) similarly found prototypical Domineering interpersonal problem
profiles for Risk Taking and Impulsivity, and a Vindictive profile for Rigid Perfectionism.1
1Note that Williams and Simms (2016) also examined the conceptually very similar Comprehensive Assessment of
Traits related to Personality Disorders facet scales and found that Non-Planfulness and Norm Violation scales had

Finally, Boudreaux et al. (2018) found that Irresponsibility and Impulsivity had prototypically
Vindictive and Domineering themed interpersonal profiles, whereas Distractibility was more
generally associated with interpersonal distress. Thus, within and across studies we see that
facets are consistently related to general interpersonal distress, but that some have prototypical
profiles of interpersonal problems in the dominant to cold-dominant problem themes.
In a related study examining how informants perceived traits and interpersonal problems
of individuals with pathological personality features, findings suggested that trait disinhibition is
associated with general aversiveness rather than with a specific domain of interpersonal
sensitivity. Results also suggested that Distractibility, a facet of disinhibition, is associated with
cold-aversive interpersonal behaviors, such as being irritatingly aloof or unresponsive (Williams
et al., 2014). Another study examining the association of interpersonal problems with the domain
of disinhibition and related psychiatric diagnoses (antisocial personality, drug dependence,
alcohol dependence, borderline personality), as assessed by DSM criteria, found that
disinhibition had a distinctive domineering interpersonal style (Girard et al., 2017).
These studies, which show a robust link between disinhibition and interpersonal
dysfunction, all rely on the shared methodology of global, retrospective self-report. However,
relatively little is known about the prospective relationships between disinhibition and
interpersonal functioning in social situations. One prior ecological momentary assessment study
examining affect and interpersonal behavior in relation to general and specific personality
pathology found that trait disinhibition was associated with less dominant behavior, less
affiliative behavior and perceived affiliation, more negative affect and less positive affect during
prototypically Domineering and Risk taking had prototypically Vindictive themed interpersonal problem profiles,
respectively, but that Irresponsibility, Non-perseverance, Workaholism, and Perfectionism were only associated
diffusely with interpersonal distress generally.

social interactions on average. Compared to other personality traits, disinhibition was associated
with a less clear interpersonal signature (Ringwald et al., 2021). Although these findings are
informative as this study was one of the first to examine the relationship between trait
disinhibition and EMA outcomes, it only examined the domain of disinhibition and did not
explore the relations among specific lower-level facets of trait disinhibition and interpersonal
behavior.
Taken together, the vast majority of the research linking disinhibition to interpersonal
functioning is based on mono-method, global, cross-sectional self-report scales, and when direct
links have been investigated with behavior in daily life it has been limited to domain scales of
disinhibition. Given that facets appear to some differential association with interpersonal
functioning, it would be useful to examine their associations with behavior and emotions
experienced in daily life, particularly in social situations.
The Current Study
To address the gap in research on daily manifestations of disinhibition and to examine the
link between trait disinhibition and daily outcomes, we aim to examine how trait disinhibition
and its lower-level facets (Irresponsibility, Impulsivity, Distractibility, Risk taking, and Lack of
rigid perfectionism) at baseline relate to ecological momentary assessment outcomes of
interpersonal interactions, including coldness/warmth, dominance/submissiveness, and positive
and negative affect. We plan to test these associations in three independent EMA samples (N
range = 330–396; observations per outcome = 8,768–17,761). Specifically, we had the following
research questions: 1) How does trait disinhibition and its lower-level facets–Irresponsibility,
Impulsivity, Distractibility, Non-perseverance, Non-planfulness, Risk taking, Lack of
workaholism, and Lack of rigid perfectionism–relate to daily life outcomes, including
DISINHIBITION IN DAILY LIFE 7
interpersonal behavior (dominance, warmth) and affect, and 2) How does the relationship
between daily life outcomes and trait disinhibition and its lower-level facets change after
controlling for trait antagonism? We hypothesized that 1) Trait disinhibition and all its lower-
level facets will be associated with more negative affect in daily life, and more dominance and
less warmth toward others during social interactions; 2) We do not have a specific hypothesis for
the relationship between trait disinhibition and positive affect, but we predict that all lower-level
facets of trait disinhibition, except for Risk taking, will be negatively associated with positive
affect, while Risk taking will be positively related to positive affect; and 3) Absent any empirical
findings, we do not have specific hypotheses on the potential overlap between trait disinhibition
and trait antagonism in relation to daily dominant and affiliative behavior.

Since we conducted secondary data analyses, we did not determine each sample size for
the express purpose of this study. However, we calculated the minimum effect size in the
population that would result in power of .80 and alpha at .05 using G*Power (Faul et al., 2009).
The required effect size to detect significance is as follows: Sample 1 = .15, Sample 2 = .15,
Sample 3 = .14.
Samples and Procedures
Three samples of momentary affect and interpersonal outcomes were collected using
ecological momentary assessment paradigms that varied somewhat in their exact procedures and

Measures
Trait disinhibition was measured in S1 and S2 using the Disinhibition domain and facets
of the Personality Inventory of DSM-5 – Short Form (PID-5–SF; Maples et al., 2015), which is
comprised of 100 items (4 for each of 25 trait facets) that are rated on a four-point Likert scale (0
DISINHIBITION IN DAILY LIFE 9
– Very False or Often False; 1 – Sometimes or Somewhat False; 2 – Sometimes or Somewhat
True; 3 – Very True or Often True). For this study, we only focus on the Disinhibition domain
and its facets (Irresponsibility, Impulsivity, Distractibility, Risk taking, and Lack of rigid
perfectionism) and the Antagonism domain score.
S3 used the Comprehensive Assessment of Traits relevant to Personality Disorder Static
Form (CAT-PD-SF; Simms, 2013), which includes 216 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 =
very untrue of me, 4 = very true of me). For this project, we will only examine traits with
empirical and conceptual links to disinhibition, including Irresponsibility, Non-perseverance, and
Non-planfulness. Of note, we had initially planned on including Lack of workaholism and Lack
of perfectionism in our calculation of trait disinhibition with the CAT-PD-SF in S3, but after
preregistering the analyses realized that CAT-PD-SF and PID-5-SF would not be equivalent
since the PID-5-SF does not use Lack of perfectionism and Lack of workaholism as lower-level
facets in its scoring of trait disinhibition. Therefore, to make the two measures more comparable,
we decided to exclude Lack of perfectionism and Lack of workaholism from the CAT-PD-SF
disinhibition domain score and only include them in individual facet-level analyses2.
Trait antagonism was represented in S1 and S2 as the PID-5-SF Antagonism domain
score. In S3, it was represented by the mean of CAT-PD-SF Callousness, Domineering,
Exhibitionism, Grandiosity, Hostile aggression, Manipulativeness, Norm violation, Rudeness,
and Anger.
Average momentary interpersonal behavior was assessed using the Visual Interpersonal
Analogue Scale (VIAS; Woods et al., 2023), which was developed to efficiently assess dominant
2Note that when lack of perfectionism and lack of workaholism are included as facets of trait disinhibition in CAT-
PD-SF, they result in null associations between trait disinhibition and daily outcomes due to the complex
associations between workaholism/perfectionism and other disinhibition facets.

and affiliative behavior during social interactions. Affiliative behavior was assessed using a
visual analogue slider bar ranging from -50 (Cold/Distant/Hostile) to 50
(Warm/Friendly/Caring), and average momentary coldness/warmth was represented in all
samples as the person-specific average of all EMA ratings from -50 to 50. Dominant behavior
was assessed using the VIAS similar to affiliative behavior, but the lower pole was described as
“Accommodating/Submissive/Timid” and the positive pole as “Assertive/Dominant/
Controlling.” Average momentary dominance/submissiveness was represented in all samples as
the person-specific average of all EMA ratings from -50 to 50.
Momentary positive affect was represented by Happy, Proud, Content, Excited, and
Relaxed. Negative affect was represented by Ashamed, Nervous, Hostile, Sad, and Angry. The
adjectives are a subset of the broader set of adjectives taken from the Positive and Negative
Affective Schedule (Watson et al., 1988). Participants were asked questions in the form “How
ADJECTIVE do you feel right now?”. Ratings were made on a scale from 0 (Not at All) to 100
(Extremely). In S1 and S2, however, “confident” was used instead of “content” to represent
positive affect. The five items for PA and NA were averaged to create indices of positive affect
and negative affect. Average momentary positive affect was represented in all samples as the
person-specific average of all EMA ratings from 0 to 100, and average momentary negative
affect was represented in all samples as the person-specific average of all EMA ratings from 0 to
100.
More detailed information on each measure is provided in the Supplemental Material
available online, “Measures”.

Analytic Plan
For all analyses, we used Base R (v4.2.3; R Core Team, 2023) and Rstudio (v2023.06.0;
Posit Team, 2023), in addition to the following R packages: psych (Revelle, 2023), dplyr
(Wickham et al., 2023), ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016), Hmisc (Harrell, 2023), corrplot (Wei &
Simko, 2021), corrtable (van der Laken, 2022), statip (Poncet & The R Core Team, 2019), and
emmeans (Lenth, 2023). All scores were calculated using instrument-standard procedures.
Specifically, for the testing of our preregistered hypotheses, we operationalized our variables as
follows:
To test our primary preregistered hypotheses, we estimated regression models predicting
momentary affiliative behavior from dispositional disinhibition. Separately, we predicted
momentary dominant behavior from dispositional disinhibition. We also estimated regression
models predicting momentary negative affect during social interactions, and separately, negative
affect outside of social interactions from dispositional disinhibition. Similarly, we estimated
regression models predicting momentary positive affect during social interactions, and
separately, positive affect outside of social interactions from dispositional disinhibition.
We also estimated separate regression models to predict the lower-level facets of
disinhibition (Irresponsibility, Impulsivity, Distractibility, Risk taking, and Lack of rigid
perfectionism3 in S1 and S2; Irresponsibility, Non-perseverance, Non-planfulness, Lack of
workaholism, and Lack of perfectionism in S3) from momentary affiliative and dominant
behavior, and from momentary positive and negative affect both during social interactions and
regardless of social context.
3 Although trait disinhibition as scored by the PID-5-SF does not include Risk taking and Lack of rigid
perfectionism, we decided to include these facets in individual facet-level models due to their conceptual ties to trait
disinhibition (Krueger et al., 2012).
DISINHIBITION IN DAILY LIFE 12
Finally, we estimated the models described above with momentary affiliative and
dominant behavior while controlling for trait antagonism.
Results
Throughout, we used a threshold of r ≤ .1 for a small effect size, r ≤ .2 for a medium effect, and r
≤ .3 for a large effect size given that these are cross-methods effects of global retrospective self-
report associated with momentary reports from EMA.

from .27 to .39. The correlation between average NA during social interactions and trait
disinhibition was also significant across all samples, with effect sizes generally similar to those
of the daily NA models. In contrast, the correlation between average PA, both momentary and
during social interactions, and trait disinhibition was less consistent with weaker effects, ranging
from -.03 to -.13. Warmth during social interactions consistently showed a significant negative
correlation with trait disinhibition across all three samples (r range: -.11 to -.21). However, the
correlation between dominance and trait disinhibition was small and nonsignificant in all
samples.

Trait Disinhibition – Facet Findings
Consistent with the domain findings, the correlation between average momentary NA and
disinhibition facets was significant in all samples, with values ranging from .15 to .35. The
correlation between NA during social interactions and disinhibition facets was somewhat weaker
and less consistent, with effects ranging from .05 to .35. The findings for PA, both daily and
during social interactions, and disinhibition facets were mixed. The relationship between the
Irresponsibility facet of trait disinhibition and warmth during social interactions was significant
in all three samples (r range: -.17 to -.27). Likewise, Impulsivity had a negative relationship with
warmth, with effects of -.13 and -.15. The relationship between Distractibility and warmth was
mixed, Non-perseverance was negatively related to warmth (r = -.12), while Non-planfulness
was not significantly related to warmth. Dominance during social interactions was not
significantly related to any of the disinhibition facets.

After accounting for the effect of trait antagonism, the relationship between Lack of
perfectionism and daily negative affect remained significant in S1 (β = -.22, 95% CI = -.33, -.12,
p = .000). Furthermore, after controlling for trait antagonism, trait Lack of perfectionism was
negatively and significantly associated with negative affect during social interactions in S1 (β = -
.17, 95% CI = -.28, -.068, p = .0014) and S3 (β = -.12, 95% CI = -.22, -.017, p = .0239).
Similarly, the association between trait Lack of workaholism was significantly associated with
negative affect during social interactions above and beyond trait antagonism in S3 (β = -.13,

Discussion
Disinhibition is a personality trait that has been included in several prominent models of
psychopathology and has wide-ranging implications for psychopathology, personality pathology,
and health behaviors. The bulk of prior work examining the relationship between trait
disinhibition and social functioning has been cross-sectional, while interpersonal situations are
context-specific and often best studied in the moment as they unfold. More recently, several
EMA and daily diary studies have examined the relationship between interpersonal functioning
and trait disinhibition, but none explored the link between their lower-level facets and
interpersonal behavior. This study examined the association of trait disinhibition and its lower-
level facets with daily outcomes, including affect, dominance, and affiliative behavior during
social interactions. Across three preregistered samples, we found consistent associations between
disinhibition and its constituent traits with higher daily negative affect, and lower warmth and
DISINHIBITION IN DAILY LIFE 18
higher negative affect during social interactions, which is in line with similar analyses using
some of the same data examining the relationship between trait disinhibition and EMA outcomes
(Ringwald et al., 2021). Extending prior work, we also examined the associations between
disinhibition and its constituent traits with daily outcomes above and beyond the role of trait
antagonism. Although the relations with warmth could be explained by the shared variance
between disinhibition and antagonism, the relations with negative affect could not and survived
correction for antagonism.
Our findings suggest that although trait disinhibition was related to interpersonal
functioning, this association seems to be mostly accounted for by the shared variance with trait
antagonism. We consistently found a moderate and negative association between trait
disinhibition and warmth during social interactions, however, after accounting for trait
antagonism, the findings were largely nonsignificant and, at best, inconsistent. This finding
stands in contrast to previous cross-sectional work pointing to the link between trait disinhibition
and higher interpersonal dysfunction (Williams et al., 2014; Wright et al., 2012). However, in
those prior studies, the overlap with antagonism is rarely if ever adjusted for. It is noteworthy
that these initially significant findings with warmth that disappear after covariate adjustment
emerged across two different measures of trait disinhibition, PID-5-SF and CAT-PD-SF, further
pointing to the robustness of the findings. This suggests that interpersonal warmth/coldness is not
directly related to disinhibition but rather may be primarily a correlate of trait antagonism. This
is in line with previous findings on antagonism and interpersonal functioning using ambulatory
assessment methods (Vize et al., 2022).
In addition, we found no associations between disinhibition and interpersonal dominant
behavior across all samples. This stands in contrast to cross-sectional research that has typically
DISINHIBITION IN DAILY LIFE 19
found a positive association between disinhibition and dominance (e.g., Wright et al., 2012). We
did, however, find some measure-specific suppression effects with trait disinhibition, as assessed
by the PID-5-SF, and dominance after accounting for trait antagonism. The negative association
between trait disinhibition and dominance may seem counter-intuitive, as we would anticipate a
positive link between disinhibition, a part of the externalizing spectrum, and dominance in
interpersonal situations. However, in the same control models, the relationship between trait
antagonism and dominance was positive, though statistical significance was inconsistent (Sample
1: β = .12, 95% CI = .00, .25, p = .050; Sample 2: β = .19, 95% CI = .07, .31, p = .003), partially
explaining the negative suppression effect with trait disinhibition. Once the shared variance with
antagonism was accounted for, the residual negative association between disinhibition and
interpersonal dominance may suggest that there could be aspects of disinhibition (e.g., Lack of
perseverance) that contribute to submissive behavior in interpersonal situations. Since we found
no suppression effect with trait disinhibition as assessed by CAT-PD-SF in Sample 3, future
work is needed to further explore this association using the CAT-PD-SF, as it is possible that
sample- or protocol-specific differences in our study may have contributed to the different set of
results in Sample 3. Regardless, since the suppression effect was inconsistent across the three
samples, this finding is only speculative at this point and should be interpreted with caution.
We also consistently found a modest to moderate positive association between daily
negative affect and trait disinhibition in all three samples and across both trait measures of
disinhibition, which is in line with previous EMA work (Ringwald et al., 2021). We also
observed a similar pattern with Risk taking, another facet of trait disinhibition. In addition, these
findings held above and beyond the effect of trait antagonism in all models, with the exception of
facet Non-planfulness in Sample 3 and Risk taking in Sample 2. The significant association
DISINHIBITION IN DAILY LIFE 20
between trait disinhibition and negative affect after adjusting for trait antagonism may explain
the moderate correlation found in prior studies between internalizing and externalizing spectra of
psychopathology (e.g., Scott et al., 2020; Wright et al., 2015). There are several possible
explanations for this finding: It is possible that the process cutting across and linking
internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, despite their dissimilar outward presentations
and distinct affective dynamic signatures, may be negative affectivity. In other words, the
process linking internalizing and externalizing psychopathology could be the experience of
distress, which is shared across all forms of psychopathology. This view is in line with theories
suggesting that the tendency to experience negative emotions, or neuroticism, could reflect a
general factor of psychopathology (e.g., Caspi et al., 2014; Tackett et al., 2013; Southward et al.,
2023). Another possibility is that disinhibition may increase the risk of experiencing negative
emotions in general, and this may, in turn, play a role in developing or experiencing internalizing
pathologies. That is, trait disinhibition may serve as a vulnerability factor for increased
frequency or intensity of negative emotions, which, in turn, could lead to internalizing
psychopathologies. This hypothesis could partially explain the positive correlation and high rates
of cooccurrence between externalizing psychopathology, such as disinhibition, and internalizing
conditions, such as anxiety and depression, which are reported to have high rates of covariation
(e.g., Carragher et al., 2015; Wilner et al., 2016). Since this is, to our knowledge, the first study
to explore this linkage using ambulatory assessment data, it would be worthwhile for future
studies to replicate this finding.
Finally, both Perfectionism and Workaholism were positively associated with the amount
of negative affect (both daily and during social interactions) experienced in the moment. Given
that many structural models would presume that perfectionism and workaholism reflect the
DISINHIBITION IN DAILY LIFE 21
opposite pole of a dimension with disinhibition, these positive associations may seem
unexpected. However, the shared positive association with distress highlights the maladaptivity
that is associated with both disinhibition and its logical opposite, constraint. The positive
association between Perfectionism/Workaholism and negative affect may also be partially
explained by viewing overcontrol, including perfectionism and workaholism, as a separate and
distinct domain from disinhibition. This perspective is also reflected in the most recent edition of
the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, which includes anankastia in the
dimensional trait model for diagnosing personality disorders (ICD-11; World Health
Organization, 2019). In support of this view, a study examining the construct validity and
structure of CAT-PD domains found that anankastia, representing overcontrol, rigid adherence to
routines, and risk aversion, which has been typically viewed as the low end of trait disinhibition
(Krueger et al., 2012), emerged as a sixth personality factor distinct from disinhibition (Ringwald
et al., 2023). Given the discrepant views on the exact relationship between conscientiousness,
anankastia, and disinhibition, future research is needed to further explore the associations
between disinhibition and overcontrol and how each relates to interpersonal functioning.
Conclusion
This study is one of the first to specifically examine the relationship of trait disinhibition
and its lower-level facets with ecological momentary assessment outcomes of interpersonal
interactions in daily life, and contributes to the body work on personality and social functioning.
Across three preregistered samples, we found that trait disinhibition is associated with less
warmth during social interactions as well as increased negative affect in daily life. Our results
have implications for the manifestation of disinhibition in daily life, the conceptualization of
DISINHIBITION IN DAILY LIFE 22
personality disorders as interpersonal disorders, and the overlap between internalizing and
externalizing psychopathology.
