Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 3
Abstract
Do people of different socioeconomic status differ in how they see themselves on the Big Two
self-concept dimensions of agency and communion? Existent research relevant to this
theoretically and socially important question has generally been indirect: it has relied on distant
proxies for agentic and communal self-concepts, narrow operationalizations of socioeconomic
status, comparatively small samples, and data from few nations/world regions. By contrast, the
present research directly examines the associations between socioeconomic status and agentic
and communal self-concepts, relies on well-validated measures of agency and communion,
examines three complementary measures of socioeconomic status, and uses data from 6 million
people (years of age: M = 26.12, SD = 11.50) across 133 nations. Overall, people of higher status
saw themselves as somewhat more agentic and as slightly less (or negligibly less) communal.
Crucially, those associations varied considerably across nations. We sought to explain that
variation with 11 national characteristics and found only three of them to be robustly relevant:
National religiosity and pathogen load curbed status differences in agentic self-concepts, and
income inequality amplified status differences in communal self-concepts. Our discussion
develops theory to explain the importance of national religiosity, pathogen load, and income
inequality for socioeconomic-status differences in agentic and communal self-concepts and it
also describes the substantial societal implications of those differences.

Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Agentic and Communal Self-Concepts:
Insights from 6 Million People across 133 Nations
Do people from different socioeconomic status-groups think and feel differently about
themselves? Stated another way, does the content of their self-concepts differ systematically?
Here, we seek to answer this question and we do so by focusing on the two most fundamental
dimensions of the self-concept: the Big Two of agency (manifest in assertiveness, energy, and
originality) and communion (manifest in kindness, helpfulness, and forgiveness) (Bakan, 1966;
Leary, 1957). Understanding socioeconomic-status differences in agentic and communal self-
concepts is of much theoretical and societal value (reviewed below). And, yet, relevant research
is sparse and the little research that has been conducted is limited by (a) distant proxy-measures
of agentic and communal self-concepts (for a single exception, see Abele, 2003), (b) narrow
operationalizations of socioeconomic status, (c) comparatively small samples of participants, and
(d) data from few nations or world regions. In an effort to address this unsatisfactory state of
science, we tested for socioeconomic-status differences in agentic and communal self-concepts
by means of relying on (a) direct, well-validated measures of agentic and communal self-
concepts (BFI-Big Two Scales; Entringer et al., 2021b), (b) multiple and complementary
measures of socioeconomic status (self-categorization into social classes, occupational status, and
categorization of parents into social classes; Berkessel et al., 2021), (c) a large sample of
participants by virtually all standards of comparison (up to 6 million people; Fraley et al., 2022),
and (d) data from most nations worldwide (up to 133 nations; Gosling et al., 2004). The large
number of nations in our dataset allowed us to test whether our results varied across nations and,
if so, whether that variation may be accounted for by eleven theoretically relevant characteristics
of nations (e.g., national wealth, income inequality, individualism-collectivism).
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 5
The remainder of this Introduction proceeds in three steps. First, we more thoroughly
introduce the key constructs: agentic and communal self-concepts and socioeconomic status.
Second, we review existent theory and empirical research on socioeconomic-status differences in
agentic and communal self-concepts. Finally, we explain why those status differences may vary
across nations and introduce some national characteristics that could plausibly account for that
variation.
Key Constructs
Agentic and Communal Self-Concepts
Modern dictionaries include tens of thousands of terms that people can use to describe
themselves (Allport & Odbert, 1936; Benet & Waller, 1995). Few of those self-descriptive terms
mean the exact same thing, but virtually all of them are related to other self-descriptive terms
(e.g., kindness and forgiveness are not identical, but related). According to the classic view—the
reflective view (Bollen & Lennox, 1991; Edwards & Bagozzi, 2000)—self-descriptive terms are
related because they partly share a common, more fundamental cause or factor. Factor analyses
were invented to identify such underlying factors (Spearman, 1904; Thurstone, 1931). Notably,
the identified factors may be interrelated themselves, due to even more fundamental, “higher-
order” factors (Digman, 1997; Marsh & Hocevar, 1988). Thus, factors can be factor-analyzed,
resulting in even more fundamental factors that can themselves be factor-analyzed and so on.
Psychologists went down this path to identify the number and nature of the most fundamental
factors (Cattell, 1945; Goldberg, 1990). Across many different societies, including larger-scale
industrialized societies and smaller-scale non-industrialized societies, two factors have
consistently emerged at the most fundamental level. Those two factors are reflected in views of
the self as assertive, energetic, and original (factor 1) and as kind, helpful, and forgiving (factor
2) (Saucier et al., 2014a, 2014b; Thalmayer et al., 2020). Following Bakan’s (1966) classic
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 6
terminology, the former factor is often labeled “agency” and the latter factor “communion”
(Abele & Wojciszke, 2018; Wiggins, 1991).
Agency and communion are considered “fundamental dimensions” not only in self-
concept research, but in all of human psychology (Abele & Wojciszke, 2007; Judd et al., 2005).
Indeed, agency and communion (sometimes disguised by differing labels) are fundamental in
social cognition (competence and warmth; Fiske et al., 2002), personality (dynamism and social
self-regulation; Saucier et al., 2014a, 2014b), clinical psychology (dominance and nurturance;
Leary, 1957), motivational psychology (power and intimacy; McAdams, 1985), organizational
psychology (initiating structure and consideration; Bass, 1990), and gender psychology
(masculinity and femininity; Bem, 1974). Agency and communion matter even beyond
psychology (Abele & Wojciszke, 2014), such as in sociology, where they go by the names of
“instrumentality” and “expressiveness” (Parsons & Bales, 1955). Thus, research on agency and
communion (whether in the domain of the self or in some other domain) has the potential to build
much-needed bridges across the disunited branches of psychology and between psychology and
other social sciences (Brewer, 2013; Oishi et al., 2009).
Socioeconomic Status
All Mammalian groups are hierarchically structured (Smith et al., 2016; van Vugt &
Smith, 2019). Individuals at the top of the social hierarchy possess the most social influence and
enjoy privileged access to valued resources (Cowlishaw & Dunbar, 1991; Schjelderup-Ebbe,
1922). In today’s industrialized societies, human social hierarchies mainly take the form of
socioeconomic-status hierarchies, typically ranging from the “working class” to the “upper class”
with various forms of “middle classes” in between (e.g., “lower-middle,” “middle,” and “upper-
middle classes”). Researchers sort participants into those status groups by various means, all of
which have their idiosyncratic strengths and weaknesses. Perhaps the most direct approach is to
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 7
ask participants to categorize themselves into their status group or class. A strength of this
approach is that it captures people’s personal identity. A potential weakness is that identities are
inherently subjective. A more indirect approach is to ask participants to report on their highest
level of education. A strength is that this approach is less subjective (people typically know quite
accurately what their highest degree is, and there is little wiggle room for reporting a higher
degree than one actually has, even if self-enhancement motives may naturally tempt people to do
so). Serious weaknesses, however, are that one’s level of education is a distant indicator of
socioeconomic status, at best (e.g., dishwasher-turns-millionaire, philosopher-turns-cabby) and is
telling only once education is completed (and education is often completed rather late in life in
many modern societies). Another indirect approach to assess status is (household) income. This
approach is very popular but has weaknesses, too (Diemer et al., 2013). Perhaps the most obvious
one is that the same absolute income can result in drastically different living standards dependent
on where people live (e.g., San Francisco, California vs. El Paso, Texas). Indices of occupational
status constitute a third approach and a (partial) remedy to the aforementioned weaknesses
inherent in the assessment of highest education and income. Finally, the socioeconomic status of
people’s parents is relevant. After all, most people have been socialized in their parents’ status
group (no matter what their status is today) and, thus, have spent most of their formative years in
that group (adopting group-typical values, norms, and behavioral patterns; Bourdieu, 1979).
The gold standard of status assessment has become the simultaneous administration of
complementary measures (Kraus et al., 2012; Singh-Manoux et al., 2003). The focus, then, is on
the results that emerge consistently across measures. That way, it is assured that the conclusions
drawn are not idiosyncratically caused by a specific aspect of status (or of status measurement).
In keeping with this gold standard, we operationalized socioeconomic status in three
complementary ways (self-categorization into classes, occupational status, and categorization of
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 8
one’s parents into classes) and we focused on those results that emerged consistently across
measures.
Existent Theory and Empirical Research
Existent Theory
Several existent theories make predictions regarding socio-economic status differences in
agentic self-concepts. One group of these theories stresses perceptions of personal control in
agency and, thus, proposes the following: high socioeconomic status, by definition, comes with
more resources and, therefore, engenders more feelings of personal control and agency (Kraus et
al., 2012; Rucker et al., 2018). Another group of theories stresses dominant-assertive
interpersonal behaviors in agency and considers them a social signal of high rank or social status
(Leary, 1957; Wiggins, 1979). And because high socioeconomic status is a specific instantiation
of social status, it follows from that group of theories, too, that higher socioeconomic status will
engender more feelings of agency (cf. Barkow, 1980; Mahadevan et al., 2021). A final group of
theories stresses social influence in agency and, thus, assumes a conceptual overlap between
higher socioeconomic status (which grants more social influence) and agency (Bandura, 2006;
Hogan, 1982). Self-perception processes (Bem, 1967, 1972), then, will lead from higher
socioeconomic status to self-perceptions of higher agency. In sum, different theories are relevant
to socioeconomic-status differences in agentic self-concepts, but they all predict (for different
reasons) the same thing: People from higher socioeconomic-status groups should describe
themselves as more agentic (because higher status leads to a more agentic self-concepts).
Existent theories make much more heterogeneous predictions regarding socioeconomic-
status differences in communal self-concepts. One group of theories centers on communal deeds
as a means of engendering support from others in a reciprocal fashion (cf. Trivers, 1971, 2006).
According to that group (Kraus et al., 2012; Rucker et al., 2018), people of lower socioeconomic
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 9
status are more dependent on support from others, because they lack the economic means to
reliably realize their goals on their own (cf. communion and secondary control over one’s life;
Charles & Carstensen, 2010; Freund & Baltes, 1998). Consequently, people of lower
socioeconomic status are thought to live more communal lives, which will be reflected in their
self-concepts (Bem, 1967, 1972). Following the logic of another group of theories results in the
outright opposite prediction. According to these theories, people of higher socioeconomic status
possess much more resources, time, and freedom to do good and, thus, will do so (Korndörfer et
al., 2015; Trautmann et al., 2013). In effect, people of higher socioeconomic status will see
themselves as more communal (Bem, 1967, 1972). Notably, the processes that drive the
contradictory predictions from the two groups of theories are not mutually exclusive. Thus, it is
entirely possible that they operate simultaneously and result in an overall null-relation between
socioeconomic status and a communal self-concept.
Existent Empirical Research
Direct empirical research on socioeconomic-status differences in agentic and communal
self-concepts is sparse. We know of only a single, published study that used dedicated measures
of agentic and communal self-concepts. Specifically, Abele (2003) examined agentic and
communal self-concepts in about 800 university graduates from Germany. She found that
graduates who had a more successful career saw themselves as more agentic than graduates who
had a less successful career (.26 ≤ rs ≤ .34), and she found no significant self-concept differences
in communion (.01 ≤ rs ≤ .05). That direct evidence remains wanting, however, because the
status measures were indirect (career success) and the sample came from a single nation
(Germany).
Given the dearth of direct evidence, it is necessary to turn to indirect evidence, which is
plentiful. One strand of indirect evidence examined socioeconomic-status differences in
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 10
independent and interdependent self-construals (i.e., self-concepts marked by uniqueness and
individuality vs. self-concepts marked by social embeddedness and collectivity). Although
conceptually distinct from agentic and communal self-concepts (Abele et al., 2016), those
construals are relevant because, in factor analyses, independent construals load mainly on the
more fundamental agency factor whereas interdependent construals load mainly on the more
fundamental communion factor (Abele & Wojciszke, 2007). Two studies found no significant
self-construal differences between people of lower and higher status, but the sample sizes were
small (Snibbe & Markus, 2005: N = 120; Stephens et al., 2007: N = 50). By contrast, Fernández
et al. (2005) examined about 4,000 university students from 29 nations. Students from higher-
status families described themselves as more independent (.03 ≤ βs ≤ .15), whereas students from
lower-status families described themselves as more interdependent (-.08 ≤ βs ≤ -.07). Notably,
though, Snibbe and Markus (2005) questioned the suitability of self-construals in the context of
socioeconomic-status (SES) differences, because “the Singelis scale [the standard measure of
self-construals] was designed to differentiate between European Americans and Japanese, and not
between people with different SES” (p. 714). Thus, results regarding independence and
interdependence should not only be considered indirect, but also with caution.
Another strand of research that offers indirect evidence concerns status differences in
parenting values. Values, including those on parenting, are abstract goals (Maio, 2010; Schwartz,
1992) and, thus, of an aspirational nature. That nature renders their link to the self-concept
ambiguous (Gebauer et al., 2013b; Verplanken & Holland, 2002): Do people value high agency
because they see themselves as agentic or because they consider themselves lacking agency and,
therefore, want to acquire more of it? We are aware of two published studies that tested for status
differences in agentic and communal parenting values. Tudge et al. (2000) examined 71 parents
from the US and Russia. In both nations, parents of higher social status thought that children
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 11
should primarily be taught agency (e.g., self-direction), and parents of lower status thought that
children should primarily be taught communion (e.g., conformity to rules) (Trapnell & Paulhus,
2012). Miyamoto et al. (2018) also examined status differences in parenting values, albeit at a
much larger scale. More precisely, they used nation-representative data from 85,296 participants
across 60 nations (World Values Survey, wave 6). Across all 60 nations, people of higher status
thought that children should primarily be taught agency (B = .04). Status differences regarding
parenting values in the communal domain were not significant (B = -.002).
Of interest, this latter study examined whether the results varied between eight world
regions (Confucian, Frontier, African, Ex-Communist, Latin American, Middle Eastern,
Southeast/South Asian, and European). The overall positive association between status and
agentic parenting values was particularly strong in Frontier regions (B = .09) and European
regions (B = .08) and the same association was non-significant in Southeast/South Asian regions.
The overall non-significant association between status and communal parenting values also
varied across the eight world regions: Higher status was associated with lower communal
parenting values in Frontier regions (B = -.05), but with higher communal parenting values in
Confucian regions (B = .04). In all other world regions, the different status groups did not differ
1,2
from each other in their communal parenting values.
National Variation and Its Explanations
Miyamoto et al.’s (2018) research on parenting values across eight world regions suggests
two things. First, socioeconomic-status differences in agentic and communal self-concepts, too,
may vary across nations. Second, exogenous national characteristics may drive this national
variation. Consequently, we had two additional research questions (in addition to overall status
differences in agentic and communal self-concepts). First, do nations vary regarding status
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 12
differences in agentic and communal self-concepts? And, second, what are the exogenous
national characteristics that may explain that variation (if it exists at all)?
We chose an exploratory approach to address these latter two questions. The rationale
behind our choice was two-fold. First, the setup of our investigation is ideally suited for an
exploratory approach (very large sample sizes + three measures of socioeconomic status + three
variants of the BFI-Big Two Scales). Second, based on the literature, several potentially relevant
national characteristics may explain why nations vary in the degree to which socioeconomic
status is associated with agentic and communal self-concepts. Indeed, we found no less than 11
national characteristics that appeared relevant according to the literature: (1) income inequality,
(2) national wealth, (3) unemployment rate, (4) intergenerational persistence, (5) pathogen load,
(6) national religiosity, (7) individualism-collectivism, (8) power distance, (9) fertility rate, (10)
national happiness, and (11) gender equality. Space does not permit detailed explanations of why
the literature considers each of those eleven national characteristics relevant (especially because
the explanations for the same characteristic sometimes contradict each other, resulting in opposite
for purely illustrative purposes, elaborate on three of those explanations in the text.
First, individualism-collectivism is a good candidate as a nation-level moderator of status
differences in agentic and communal self-concepts: Agency is a cultural ideal in individualist
nations, and communion is a cultural ideal in collectivist nations (Sedikides et al., 2003; 2015).
At the same time, people of higher status have more opportunities to reach cultural ideals than
people of lower status (Johnson & Krueger, 2005; Lachman & Weaver, 1998). It follows that the
association between higher status and more agentic self-concepts should be particularly strong in
individualist nations. And, by the same token, the association between higher status and more
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 13
communal self-concepts should be particularly strong in collectivist nations (cf. Grossmann &
Varnum, 2011; Zhang et al., 2021).
Second, income inequality is another good candidate as a nation-level moderator of status
differences in agentic and communal self-concepts. Côté et al. (2015) found that income
inequality moderates status differences in prosociality. The investigation was motivated by the
following rationale: In economically unequal contexts, people of higher socioeconomic status
should feel particularly superior to people of lower status because the objective wealth gap is, by
definition, particularly large in unequal contexts. At the same time, feelings of superiority
engender feelings of entitlement and narcissism (Campbell et al., 2004; Krizan & Herlache,
2018), which, in turn, curtail prosociality and prosocial self-concepts (Nehrlich et al., 2019;
Thielmann et al., 2020). Together, it follows that the association between higher status and
communal self-concepts should be more negative (or less positive) in economically unequal
nations compared to economically equal ones. In a large-scale replication attempt, however,
Schmukle et al. (2019) found no evidence for Côté et al.’s inequality hypothesis. Thus, we
included income inequality for two reasons—primarily for the theoretical reasons provided by
Côté et al., but also to help clarify (in small and somewhat indirect part) the inconsistent state of
research on the inequality hypothesis.
Finally, feelings of personal agency arise from meeting cherished cultural values
(Bandura, 1982; Pyszcynski et al., 2004). At the same time, Tay et al. (2014) reasoned that
affluence is a particularly cherished cultural value in wealthy nations. Likewise, Gebauer et al.
(2012) argued that affluence is a particularly cherished cultural value in non-religious nations,
because those nations are free from religious anti-wealth norms (see also Berkessel et al., 2021).
It follows that the association between higher status and more agentic self-concepts should be
particularly strong in wealthy and/or non-religious nations.

Method
We were in the unique position to analyze data from up to 6,014,924 participants across
133 nations (sample sizes differed between analyses, mainly due to missing data on the status
measures: student participants, for example, were typically unable to complete the measure of
occupational status). Online Supplement S2 lists all 133 nations alongside the demographics
within each nation. Overall, participants were 26.12 years of age (SD = 11.50), 62.49% identified
as female, 37.32% as male, and 0.20% did not respond to the binary item on gender.
The data were collected from the multi-survey Internet Personality Project (IPP; Gosling
et al., 2004) from December 1998 to March 2015 and have been used extensively in previous
research. A list of all published IPP research can be retrieved from
relevant for the present investigation, we adopted, as closely as possible, the data-selection steps
from previous IPP research (Entringer et al., 2021a; Gebauer et al., 2020) and we decided on all
data-selection steps a priori. Online Supplement S3 describes our data-selection steps in detail.
Ethical Statement
Collection of the IPP data took place in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the
American Psychological Association and has been declared exempt from approval by the
institutional review boards of the University of Texas at Austin and the University of California,
Berkeley (IRB number: 2004-10-0073).
Data Suitability
The data provided a unique opportunity on several counts: very large sample sizes, very
large number of nations, complementary measures of status, and direct and well-validated
measures of agentic and communal self-concepts. However, one potential downside of the data
Status Differences in Self-Concepts 18
required consideration: The data is an opportunity sample, sampled online. We had two reasons
to believe that this is not a serious limitation, and is outweighed by the many strengths: First,
across several different study domains, IPP-based results proved replicable in nation-
representative datasets (Berkessel et al., 2021; Gebauer et al., 2017a). Second—and more
important—we carefully weighted our data to make it more nationally representative. This is a
major advance over previous IPP research, which never weighted the data (see Online
Supplement S4 for a detailed description of our weighing procedure). With a single exception
only (described later), the weighted results were conceptually identical to the unweighted ones
and, thus, lead to the same conclusions. Of course, weighing is never “perfect.” Still, the general
absence of systematic differences between the weighted and unweighted results suggests that
even perfect weights (if they existed) would not substantially change the results. All in all, we
consider the present dataset suitable to test our research question.
Procedure
After choosing the language of the study (86.33% chose English, 3.26% German, 7.95%
Spanish, and 2.46% Dutch), participants completed a larger set of measures. Among other
variables, the set assessed agentic and communal self-concepts and socioeconomic status (in this
order). Completion of measures was followed by feedback on participants’ questionnaire
responses and more general information on psychological differences between people.
Measures
Agentic and Communal Self-Concepts
The IPP includes the full 44-item Big Five Inventory (BFI; John et al., 1991) in its self-
report version. In that version, the inventory measures participants’ Big Five self-concept
(Asendorpf et al., 2002; Back et al., 2009): tellingly, the stem of each item reads “I see myself as
Status Differences in Self-Concepts 19
someone who…” (emphasize added). The Big Five and agency-communion are both (near)
exhaustive taxonomies at their hierarchical level of abstraction (McCrea & John, 1992; Wiggins,
2003), with the agency-communion taxonomy being more fundamental than the Big Five
taxonomy (Digman, 1997; Saucier et al., 2014a). Theoretically, then, it should be possible to
measure agentic and communal self-concepts with an appropriate selection of items from the
BFI’s self-report version. Entringer et al. (2021b) recently found ample empirical evidence for
this reasoning. Specifically, they subjected the 44 items of the BFI to four different scale
construction methods and, thereby, devised four variants of BFI-Big Two Scales (with partly
overlapping items). All four variants evidenced satisfactory validity, on par with four standard
measures of agency and communion from the literature (Abele et al., 2008; Saucier et al., 2014b;
Spence & Helmreich, 1978; Trapnell & Paulhus, 2012). Perhaps most importantly, all four BFI-
Big Two Scales correlated as strongly with the four standard measures as those standard
measures correlated with each other.
Research also indicated that Entringer et al.’s (2021b) measures work well in the cross-
cultural IPP dataset (Gebauer et al., 2020). More precisely, three of the four variants of the BFI-
Big Two Scales evidenced necessary and sufficient reliability and, also, necessary and sufficient
measurement invariance across nations (metric invariance; Horn & McArdle, 1992). Gebauer et
al. (2020, section S4 in their online supplement) provide a detailed description of their evidence
for measurement invariance of the BFI-Big Two Scales in the IPP dataset. Thus, based on this
evidence, we report the results for the three variants of the BFI-Big Two Scales that proved most
valid in the IPP.
The face-validity of all three scales is satisfactory (Entringer et al., 2021b). Example
items to assess agentic self-concepts include: “I see myself as someone who has an assertive
Status Differences in Self-Concepts 20
personality,” “I see myself as someone who is full of energy,” and “I see myself as someone who
is original, comes up with new ideas.” Example items to assess communal self-concepts include:
“I see myself as someone who is considerate and kind to almost everyone,” “I see myself as
someone who is helpful and unselfish with others,” and “I see myself as someone who has a
forgiving nature.” Online Supplement S5 includes all items of the three variants of the BFI-Big
Two Scales. Online Supplement S6 includes means, standard deviations, and internal
consistencies as well as skewness and kurtosis of the three variants, separately for each nation
(omnibus internal consistencies: α̅ = .64, α̅ = .74). Online Supplement S7 includes

the correlations between agency and communion for each variant of the BFI-Big Two Scales,
separately for each nation (omnibus correlations: 𝑟̅ = .25, 𝑟̅ = .19, 𝑟̅ = .20).

The direction and size of those correlations is in line with previous research on well-established
Big Two measures (Abele et al., 2008; Entringer et al., 2021b).
Socioeconomic Status
We used the following three measures of socioeconomic status (listed in the order they
appear in the survey): categorization of parents into classes, self-categorization into classes, and
occupational status. Online Supplement S8 includes the means and standard deviations as well as
skewness and kurtosis of all three measures, separately for each nation.
Self-Categorization. Participants were asked, “If financially independent, where would
you place yourself on the following spectrum for social class?” The number and wording of
response options differed somewhat between different sub-surveys of the IPP. We sorted them
into the following six categories: “working class,” “lower middle class,” “middle class,” “upper
middle class,” “upper class,” and “not financially independent.” Most students fell into the last
category, which we coded as missing data, following past research (Berkessel et al., 2021).
Status Differences in Self-Concepts 21
Categorization of Parents. Participants were asked, “Where would you place your
parents on the following spectrum for social class?” The number and wording of response
options differed somewhat between different sub-surveys of the IPP. We sorted them into the
following five categories: “working class,” “lower middle class,” “middle class,” “upper middle
class,” and “upper class.”
Occupational Status. Participants were asked, “If you are currently employed, which
occupation category best describes your job?” Participants were offered 23 options, each
reflecting a broad category (e.g., “Computer and Mathematical Occupations”). Three steps were
necessary to convert participants’ responses into a measure of occupational status. First, the
responses were converted into scores of the official Standard Occupational Classification system
(SOC-2010; Office for National Statistics, 2010). Second, those SOC-2010 scores were
converted into scores of the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO 08; ILO,
2012). Finally, those ISCO-08 scores were converted into occupational status scores according to
the International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI; Ganzeboom et al., 1992).
We used established conversion systems from SOC-2010 scores to ISCO-08 scores (Bureau of
Labor Statistics, 2012) and from ISCO-08 scores to ISEI scores (Ganzeboom, 2010). We did not
directly convert SOC-2010 scores into ISEI scores, because—to the best of our knowledge—no
direct conversion system exists.
National Characteristics
We assessed (1) income inequality with the disposable Gini coefficient from the
Standardized World Income Inequality Database (Solt, 2020), (2) national wealth with the log-
transformed (log10) gross domestic product per capita from the World Bank (The World Bank,
2021c; see also Berkessel et al., 2021), (3) unemployment rate with the share of unemployed
Status Differences in Self-Concepts 22
people relative to all 15-64 year old people available for employment (ILOSTAT, 2021), (4)
intergenerational persistence with the association between the years of education taken by one’s
parents and oneself (The World Bank, 2021a; Van der Weide et al., 2021), (5) pathogen load
with the historic prevalence of pathogenic diseases transmittable by humans (Fincher &
Thornhill, 2012), (6) national religiosity with the share of people who consider religion
important in their daily lives from the Gallup World Poll (Joshanloo & Gebauer, 2020), (7)
individualism-collectivism with a meta-analytic update of Hofstede’s scores (Taras et al., 2012),
(8) power distance with a meta-analytic update of Hofstede’s scores (Taras et al., 2012), (9)
fertility rate with the number of births per woman (The World Bank, 2021b), (10) national
happiness with scores from the world happiness report (Helliwell et al., 2015), and (11) gender
equality with the Gender Gap Index covering gender disparities in the economic, educational,
political and health area (Bekouche et al., 2015; Hausmann et al., 2006-2014). We chose the
national characteristic from the year our participants completed the IPP questionnaire. If the
national characteristic was not available for a given year, we took the information from the year
after that (or the year before that, if the year after was not available). We proceeded that way
with two years after-before completion, and, if necessary, three years after-before completion.
Online Supplement S9 includes the correlations between the eleven national characteristics
within our sample of 133 nations. In line with past research (Gebauer et al., 2017a; Joshanloo &
Gebauer, 2020), most of the national characteristics were strongly correlated. On the one hand,
those high interrelations are reassuring in that they tightly replicate prior research with partly
different sets of nations. On the other hand, the high interrelations call for particular attention to
covariates at the national level, coupled with attention to potential multicollinearity among those
national characteristics.
Status Differences in Self-Concepts 23
Analysis Strategy
Participants were nested in nations. Thus, we computed mixed models with two levels
(level 1: participants, level 2: nations). In all models, socioeconomic status was the focal
predictor, and agentic or communal self-concepts were the criteria. When agentic self-concepts
served as the criterion, we entered communal self-concepts as a covariate (i.e., as an additional
predictor). When communal self-concepts served as the criterion, we entered agentic self-
concepts as a covariate. In other words, we statistically disentangled the effect of status on
agentic self-concepts from the effect of status on communal self-concepts—a standard procedure
(Gebauer et al., 2013b, 2014).
To examine variation of our effects across nations, we included the relevant national
predictor and specified its cross-level interaction with socioeconomic status. We centered all
level-1 predictors at their nation’s mean (group-mean centering) and we centered all level-2
predictors at the mean of all involved nations (grand-mean centering) (Enders & Tofigi, 2007).
The level-1 covariates, too, were group-mean centered. We z-standardized all variables in each
model and we did so after centering (Entringer et al., 2021a). In effect, then, our models’ point
estimates (PEs) are standardized (zPEs), which can be considered mixed-model analogs to βs in
multiple regression (Snijders & Bosker, 2012).
Finally, we allowed the effects of all level-1 predictors on the self-concept to vary
between nations (in addition to the cross-national variation that we anyway specified by means
of including cross-level interactions), resulting in random-intercept and random-slope models.
We computed all mixed models with the software package MixedModels (Bates, 2018)
for the computing environment Julia (version 1.7.1, 2021; Bezanson et al., 2017). We chose
Bates’s MixedModels package in Julia, because it can be considered an updated version of Bates
Status Differences in Self-Concepts 24
et al.’s (2015) extremely popular lme4 package in R (R Core Team, 2020). Also, the former
required much less computing time than the latter (in our typical models, the MixedModels
package was about 16 times faster than the lme4 package).
Effect Size Considerations
What constitutes small, medium, and large effects in social-personality psychology? This
question has been widely debated (Funder & Ozer, 2019; Götz et al., 2022). In social-personality
psychology, the average/median effect size has been estimated at 𝑟̅ ≈ .10 (Boileau et al., 2021;
Entringer et al., 2021a). Consequently, we consider effects of zPE ≈ .10 as “medium,” effects
half that size as “small” (zPE ≈ .05), and effects twice that size as “large” (zPE ≈ .20). According
to this effect-size classification, previous research found medium-to-large effects of status
differences in agentic self-concepts (Abele, 2003: 𝑟̅ = .30; Fernández et al., 2005: 𝛽 = .09) and
small-to-medium effects (at best) of status differences in communal self-concepts (Abele, 2003:
𝑟̅ = .03; Fernández et al., 2005: 𝛽 = .08).

exclusions, and the measures relevant to our study. With regards to data availability, we have no
permission to make the data publicly available, but they can be obtained from the first author
upon request. The data-analytic code and the online supplement to this study have been made

Results
We computed all our results twice, once with weights and once without, to evaluate the
extent to which the results were affected by the representativeness of our national samples. The
Status Differences in Self-Concepts 25
advantage of including weights is that the results are more representative for the nations at large
and, thus, there is higher compatibility with the eleven national indicators (individualism-
collectivism, income inequality, wealth, etc.), most of which rest on nationally representative
data. The advantage of excluding weights is that variables for calculating the weights were
available only for a subset of participants and, thus, analyses including weights rested on a
greatly reduced number of participants (for details, see Online Supplement S4). Fortunately, the
results with and without weights were virtually identical with only a single exception: the case of
pathogen load, which is discussed later. Thus, following common practice in psychology, we
decided to report the results without weights in the main text. We report a summary of the results
with weights in Online Supplement S4 alongside the detailed explanation of our weighting
procedure.
Omnibus Status Differences Across Nations
To begin with, we tested for status differences in agentic and communal self-concepts in
our omnibus sample (i.e., across all nations). Specifically, we computed mixed models (see
Analysis Strategy) without any national characteristics included. Tables 2-3 show the results
from these mixed models.

Agentic self-concepts. We found medium sized status differences in agentic self-
concepts: People of higher status described themselves as more agentic than people of lower
̅̅̅̅̅
status and this was the case when status was measured via self-categorization, 𝑧𝑃𝐸 = .12,

displays the results separately for all three variants of agency scales. Online Supplement S10
shows the main-text results described in this paragraph separately for each nation (consequently,
this online supplement reports partial correlations, rather than mixed model results). The online
supplement includes the meta-analytic summary across all nations (standard meta-analytic steps:
r -to-z conversion, inverse-variance weighing, averaging of weighted zs, z-to-r back-

conversion). The meta-analytic results converged virtually perfectly with our main-text results,
underscoring the suitability to interpret our zPEs as effect-size estimates.
Communal self-concepts. We found very small sized (for most practical concerns
probably negligible) status differences in communal self-concepts: People of lower status
considered themselves ever so slightly more communal than people of higher status when status

National Variation in Status Differences
Agentic self-concepts. The first question to ask was whether nations vary at all regarding
status differences in agentic self-concepts. To this end, we re-ran the nine models used to
calculate the omnibus status differences in agentic self-concepts (see respective section above).
At re-run, however, we specified the nine models such that they did not allow any national
variation (i.e., variation regarding status differences in agentic self-concepts across nations).
Status Differences in Self-Concepts 30
Stated technically, we fixed the formally random slopes of status in all nine models. We found
that all nine of those “fixed-slope models” fitted our data significantly worse than their
corresponding random-slope models (average results from all 9 model comparisons, i.e., 3 status
̅̅̅
measures × 3 agency variants: 𝜒2 (5, 3,753,068) = 7853.78, 𝑝̅ < .001). Thus, status differences in
agentic self-concepts did vary considerably across nations. In Sweden, for example, people of
higher status viewed themselves considerably more agentic than people of lower status, 𝑟̅ = .14,
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
95% 𝐶𝐼 [.13, .15]. In, Nigeria, by contrast, the same effect was statistically insignificant, 𝑟̅ = .03,
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
95% 𝐶𝐼 [-.003, .06] (Online Supplement S10 reports these results for all nations separately).
Next, we set out to identify national characteristics that explain the national variation
described in the previous paragraph. We did not include the eleven national characteristics in a
single model, because of substantial multicollinearity (several variance inflation factors [VIFs] >
4, some even > 10). Instead, we first conducted nine models per national characteristic (3 status
measures × 3 agency variants) and each of those models included the cross-level interaction of
status with the said national characteristic only (thereby running no risk of multicollinearity, see
Online Supplement S12). We retained only those national characteristics that consistently
explained national variation in all nine models. In a second step, we simultaneously included all
retained national characteristics in the same model. We did so based on the expectation that step-
1 would reduce the number of national characteristics to a number so small that it would be
possible to enter the retained characteristics simultaneously in the same model without creating
multicollinearity (an expectation that turned out to be correct; mean VIF = 2.24, VIFs < 3 in all
cases, VIFs < 2.5 in ¾ of the cases).
Three of the 11 national characteristics were retained after step 1: national religiosity,
pathogen load, and fertility rate (Online Supplement S12). In step 2, national religiosity was a
Status Differences in Self-Concepts 31
significant moderator in the majority of the analyses: 78% (7 out of 9 times). Fertility rate, by
contrast, was a significant moderator in the minority of the analyses, only: 22% (2 out of 9
times). Finally, pathogen load also was a significant moderator in the minority of the analyses:
33% (3 out of 9). Notably, though, the result regarding pathogen load was the one result that
showed a difference between the weighted and unweighted results: In the weighted results,
pathogen load was a significant moderator in the majority of the analyses: 78% (7 out of 9 times;
characteristic significantly moderated the association between socioeconomic status and agentic
model including national religiosity, pathogen load and fertility rate as simultaneous moderators
of the association between socioeconomic status and agentic self-concepts.

Communal self-concepts. Do nations also vary regarding status differences in
communal self-concepts? To answer that question, we re-ran the nine models used to calculate
the omnibus status differences in communal self-concepts (see respective section earlier) but
specified the nine models such that they did not allow any national variation (i.e., we fixed the
formally random slopes of status in all nine models). Those “fixed-slope models” fitted our data
̅̅̅
significantly worse than their corresponding random-slope models, 𝜒2 (5, 3,753,068) = 6052.33,
p < .001. Evidently, status differences in communal self-concepts also varied considerably across
nations. In South Africa, for example, people of lower status perceived themselves as somewhat
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
more communal than did people of higher status, 𝑟̅ = -.05, 95% 𝐶𝐼 [-.06, -.03]. In Iceland, by
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
contrast, it was just the other way round, 𝑟̅ = .07, 95% 𝐶𝐼 [.02, .12] (Online Supplement S11
reports these results for all nations separately). So, which national characteristic may explain this
variation?
To answer that question, we used the two-step procedure devised in the previous section.
Recall that the models in step 1 include each national characteristic as a separate moderator and
the models in step 2 simultaneously include the national characteristics that were retained after
step 1. Two of the 11 national characteristics were retained after step 1: income inequality and
pathogen load (Online Supplement S13). In step 2, then, income inequality was a significant
moderator in the majority of the analyses: 78% (7 out of 9 times). Pathogen load, by contrast,
(right half) shows how often each national characteristic significantly moderated the association
results of our step-2 mixed model—that is, the model including income inequality and pathogen
load as simultaneous moderators of the association between socioeconomic status and communal
self-concepts.

Discussion
Socioeconomic status should leave its marks on people’s self-concepts (Gecas, 1982;
Wylie, 1974). Self-concepts, in turn, determine numerous important life outcomes (Bandura,
1982; Marsh & Craven, 2006). And, yet, socioeconomic-status differences regarding the two
most fundamental dimensions of the self-concept—agency and communion—have received little
attention from social-personality psychologists (for an exception, see Abele, 2003). To address
this void, we studied socioeconomic-status differences in agentic and communal self-concepts in
a very large sample of up to 6,014,924 people from 133 nations. We operationalized
socioeconomic status in three complementary ways (self-categorization into classes,
occupational status, categorization of parents into classes) and assessed agentic and communal
self-concepts with three variants of a comparatively direct and suitable measure (Entringer et al.,
2021b; Gebauer et al., 2020). Most importantly, perhaps, we studied national variation in status
differences in agentic and communal self-concepts and found substantial such variation.
Consequently, we sought to explain the variation with the help of eleven exogenous
characteristics of nations: Income inequality, national wealth, unemployment rate,
intergenerational persistence, pathogen load, national religiosity, individualism-collectivism,
power distance, fertility rate, national happiness, and gender equality.
In our omnibus sample, we found that people of higher status saw themselves as more
agentic than people of lower status, and this effect was similar to the average effect size in
̅̅̅̅̅ ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
social-personality psychology and, thus, we labeled it “medium” in size: 𝑧𝑃𝐸 = .08, 95% 𝐶𝐼
[.08, .09] (here, we report means across all three status measures and all three agency measures).
At the same time, people of lower status tended to see themselves as slightly more communal
than people of higher status, but that effect was negligible for most practical purposes (i.e., 20
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 44
̅̅̅̅̅ ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
times smaller than the average effect size in social-personality psychology: 𝑧𝑃𝐸 = -.005, 95% 𝐶𝐼
[-.01, -.002]). Importantly, though, both effects varied widely across nations (see Online
Supplements S10-S11) and we were able to identify some national characteristics that accounted
for that variation.
Theoretical Explanations for National Variation
Status Differences in Agentic Self-Concepts
With high consistency or certainty, only two national characteristics accounted for
national variation in status differences in agentic self-concepts: national religiosity and pathogen
load. Thus, those national characteristics deserve particular attention. But what also deserves
attention, are characteristics that should have accounted for national variation according to some
theory, but that did not. For this reason, we additionally discuss the lack of effects of
individualism-collectivism and income inequality.
National Religiosity. All world religions console people of lower socioeconomic status
and seek to curb the enthusiasm higher status people may naturally get from their superior
socioeconomic status (Berkessel et al., 2021; Gebauer et al., 2013a). The Bible, for example,
reads that “it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter
the kingdom of God” (Matthew 19:24). And the Qur’an states that “the poor are admitted into
Paradise before the rich, by five hundred years” (Vol. 5, Book 37, Hadith 4261). In other words,
religious nations enforce norms that may help ease the pains of poorer people and dampen the
pride richer people may otherwise derive from their wealth (Gebauer & Sedikides, 2021;
Norenzayan, 2013). As a result, higher national religiosity should curtail the association between
socioeconomic status and agentic self-concepts and it should do so by (a) enhancing feelings of
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 45
agency among people of lower status or by (b) diminishing feelings of agency among people of
higher status or by (c) both.
Indeed, this is precisely what we have found and it dovetails with previous research:
Berkessel et al. (2021), for example, found that higher national religiosity curtailed the
association between socioeconomic status and better psychological well-being (for conceptually
related results, see Gebauer et al., 2013a; Jung, 2018). A noteworthy strength of Berkessel et
al.’s research is that they found those results consistently in three large-scale datasets: the IPP
(i.e., the dataset used in the present research), the nation-representative World Values Survey
(Ingelhart et al., 2018), and the world-representative Gallup World Poll (2020).
Pathogen Load. Psychologists often consider violent encounters with strangers, or even
warfare, a prime selection pressure for humans (Fiske et al., 2007; Tooby & DeVore, 1987).
Many evolutionary anthropologists, by contrast, consider violent outgroup conflicts and war a
minor selection pressure (Hrdy, 2009; Richerson et al., 2021). Warfare against pathogens, by
contrast, is almost certainly a prime selection pressure for humans (and most other animals)
(Ewald, 1994; Fincher & Thornhill, 2012). Humans have evolved several defense lines against
pathogens, ranging from a biological immune system to a behavioral immune system (Schaller &
Duncan, 2007; Schaller & Park, 2011). Central to the behavioral immune system is “in-group
assortative sociality,” the tendency to stick to in-groups while avoiding contact with outgroups
or, more colloquially, to live in a social bubble (Fincher et al., 2008; Thornhill & Fincher, 2014).
Living in such a bubble effectively avoids contamination with foreign pathogens to which one’s
biological immune system may have no proper immune response (Fincher et al., 2008; Schaller
& Park, 2011). A large body of research has documented that people from nations high on
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 46
pathogen load exhibit many different signs of heightened in-group assortative sociality (Fincher
et al., 2008, Fincher & Thornhill, 2012).
Reference group effects may explain the diminished association between status and
agentic self-perceptions in pathogen-rich nations. Specifically, in-group assortative sociality
shifts people’s standards of comparison (Festinger, 1954; Marsh, 1987): If you live in a social
bubble, you will tend to compare yourself with the people in that bubble, rather than with people
across bubbles (Bless & Schwarz, 2010; Morse & Gergen, 1970). Thus, in pathogen rich nations,
higher status people will compare themselves almost exclusively with other higher status people
and, thereby, see themselves as somewhat less agentic than higher status people in less pathogen-
rich nations (who live less in their own social bubble and, thus, compare themselves more with
lower status people).
Insignificant National Characteristics. Individualism-collectivism was a prime
candidate for explaining national variation in status differences in agentic self-concepts (see
Introduction). In brief, people of higher status have more leeway to fulfill cultural ideals than
people of lower status (Johnson & Krueger, 2005; Lachman & Weaver, 1998) and agency is a
cultural ideal in individualist nations (Sedikides et al., 2003, 2015). Thus, we expected the
association between status and agentic self-concepts to be stronger in individualist nations than
in collectivist ones, but found no reliable support for this expectation. The cross-level interaction
involving individualism-collectivism was significant in eight out of nine step-1 analyses, and
thus, did not pass step 1 (Tables 4 and S12.7). Moreover, we found no evidence that accounting
for Miyamoto et al.’s (2018) world regions consistently helped to explain national variation in
status differences in agentic self-concepts (i.e., Confucian, Frontier, African, Ex-Communist,
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 47
Latin American, Middle Eastern, Southeast/ Southern Asian, and European; see Online
Income inequality was also a strong candidate to explain national variation in status
differences in agentic self-concepts. Cheung and Lucas (2016) formulated the compelling
hypothesis that “higher level of income inequality may increase the salience of the discrepancy
in income among people, which may in turn lead to stronger social comparison effects” (p. 333).
Consequently, it would have been reasonable to expect that status differences in agentic self-
concepts are particularly large in nations high on income inequality. However, we found no
reliable support for this reasoning: the cross-level interaction involving income inequality was
S12.1).
Status Differences in Communal Self-Concepts
Only one national characteristic—income inequality—predicted national variation in
status differences in communal self-concepts. Next, we discuss the theoretical reasons for why
income inequality may play such an important role. After that, we discuss other national
characteristics that should have played a role, too, according to some theory, but that played a
minor role at best—namely, individualism-collectivism, power distance, and national religiosity.
Income Inequality. According to Côté et al. (2015), income inequality should make
people of higher status feel particularly superior to people of lower status. And because feelings
of superiority curtail a communal life orientation (Nehrlich et al., 2019; Thielmann et al., 2020),
people of higher status should exhibit particularly little communion in economically unequal
nations. Our data was consistent with Côté et al.’s rational, but the data of other large-scale
investigations was not (Schmuckle et al., 2019). An important difference between our research
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 48
and previous research is that we focused on communal self-concepts rather than communal life
orientation or prosocial behavior. Nevertheless, the present results suggest it may be too early to
lay Côté et al.’s hypothesis to rest altogether. Instead, research that explicitly assesses feelings of
superiority and tests for possible differences between communal self-concepts and communal
behaviors is required in a next step.
Insignificant National Characteristics. Individualism-collectivism was a prime
candidate for explaining national variation in status differences in communal self-concepts.
However, we found no reliable support for this reasoning: the cross-level interaction involving
individualism-collectivism was significant in two out of nine step-1 analyses, and thus, did not
pass step 1 (Tables 4 and S13.7). Similarly, we found no evidence that accounting for
Miyamoto et al.’s (2018) world regions consistently helped to explain national variation in status
Power distance is another national characteristic that we considered as a potentially
important predictor of national variation in status differences in communal self-concepts. A
hallmark of high power distance is the conviction that status differences are legitimate (Carl et
al., 2004; Hofstede, 1980). Thus, in nations low on power distance, people of higher status
should consider their status advantages as being relatively unfair. That perceived unfairness, in
turn, should render the self-concepts of higher-status people less communal. However, we found
no reliable support for this reasoning: the cross-level interaction involving power distance was
significant in 4 out of 9 step-1 analyses, and thus, did not pass step 1 (Tables 4 and S13.8).
All world religions put a premium on a communal way of life (Gebauer et al., 2017b;
Norenzayan & Shariff, 2008). Therefore, nations high on religiosity have firm communion
norms in place (Gebauer & Sedikides, 2021; Norenzayan, 2013). At the same time, people of
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 49
higher status have more freedom to live up to national norms (Johnson & Krueger, 2005;
Lachman & Weaver, 1998). Together, people of higher social status should be more communal
in religious nations than in secular nations. However, we found no reliable support for this
reasoning: the cross-level interaction involving national religiosity was significant in 6 out of 9
step-1 analyses, and thus, did not pass step 1 (Tables 4 and S13.6).
Implications for Science and Society
We found a positive omnibus association between socioeconomic status and agentic self-
̅̅̅̅̅
concepts of 𝑧𝑃𝐸 = .08, which is consistent with many theories on the nature and origins of
agentic self-concepts (reviewed in the Existent Theory section of our Introduction). At the same
time, the size of this association was not sufficiently strong to consider socioeconomic status a
prime source of agency. This result is consistent with evolutionary theories that consider feelings
of agency the product of general status, including socioeconomic status, but also—and perhaps
most importantly—the status one enjoys within one’s personal networks (Gebauer et al., 2015;
Witkower et al., 2020).
In secular nations, we found particularly large socioeconomic-status differences in
agentic self-concepts. As secularization is on the rise in the western world (Gorski & Altınordu,
2008; Joshanloo & Gebauer, 2019), these results suggest that socioeconomic-status differences
in agentic self-concepts will become more pronounced in the future. A direct empirical test of
such cultural change is needed, but if it aligns with the present findings, social scientists and
policy makers may want to be prepared for larger disparities in agentic self-concepts between the
richer and the poorer people in society.
In nations with fewer pathogens, we found more pronounced socioeconomic-status
differences in agentic self-concepts, too. As pathogen load is falling in most parts of the world
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 50
(Thornhill & Fincher, 2014), those results also point towards larger socioeconomic-status
differences in agentic self-concepts in the future. Again, direct empirical testing is required, but
if it aligns with our findings, social scientists and policy makers should consider how to
effectively deal with this potential side effect of dwindling pathogen load.
We found a very small omnibus association between socioeconomic status and communal
̅̅̅̅̅
self-concepts of 𝑧𝑃𝐸 = -.005, which may partly reflect the simultaneous operation of opposing
processes (reviewed in the Existent Theory section of our Introduction). Yet, the absence of a
sizeable omnibus association appears to be largely due to divergent associations across nations.
Only one of our eleven national characteristics was able to account consistently for that cross-
national divergence: In nations with higher income inequality, people with lower socioeconomic
status saw themselves as more communal than did people with higher socioeconomic status. In
nations with lower income inequality, it tended to be the other way round. One way to interpret
this pattern of results is that the richer part of society is comparatively selfish in unequal
nations—at least this part of society considers themselves relatively low on communion. Income
inequality is currently rising in the western world (OECD, 2011; Picketty & Saez, 2014). If this
truly means that the richer part of society becomes increasingly selfish (future research should
look into this possibility), social scientists may want to search for antidotes that policy makers
can implement.
Limitations and Future Research
The present research focused on socioeconomic status as a global or abstract concept. For
that reason, we expected our three complementary indicators of socioeconomic status to perform
similarly and, thus, focused on what the three have in common. Of course, the three indicators
each reflect unique perspectives on conceptualizing socioeconomic status, so future research may
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 51
focus on those. For example, one may examine the effects of parents’ status on their adult
offspring’s self-concept irrespective of the adult offspring’s status.
The self-concept is organized hierarchically and the Big Two are the most fundamental
content dimensions of the self and, thus, form the basis of the hierarchy (for details, see our Key
Constructs section in the Introduction). The Big Five self-concept (Asendorpf et al., 2002; Back
et al., 2009) is somewhat more specific—situated one level up in the hierarchy (Entringer et al.,
2021b; Paulhus & John, 1998). The Big Five facets are another level up (Soto & John, 2009,
2017) and the Big Five nuances may sit at the top of the hierarchy (Mõttus & Rozgonjuk, 2021;
Stewart et al., 2022). In this initial examination of socioeconomic-status differences in self-
concepts across nations, we focused exclusively on the Big Two self-concept (among other
things, because the Big Two are particularly universal cross-culturally; Saucier et al., 2014a;
Thalmayer et al., 2020). Future research may want to focus on the more specific Big Five, their
facets, and their nuances. The present research may provide a (partial) blueprint for how to
undertake such research.
Can the present results inform predictions for future research on the Big Five? From our
agency results we consider it difficult to derive predictions for the Big Five, because agency is
the common denominator of specific items from several Big Five scales (mainly extraversion
and openness, but also conscientiousness and neuroticism; Entringer et al., 2021b, see also
Online Supplement S5). Our communion results, by contrast, may inform predictions for
agreeableness for conceptual and empirical reasons. At the conceptual level, communion and
agreeableness are particularly closely related (John & Srivastava, 1999; McCrae & Costa, 1989).
Tellingly, in the interpersonal circumplex, Wiggins (1979, 1991) labeled the positive pole of the
communion dimension “warm-agreeable” (emphasize added) and, together with two other
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 52
experts (Robert McCrae and Paul Trapnell), he considered the BFI-Agreeableness Scale—and
only that BFI scale—almost completely saturated with communal content (Entringer et al.,
2021b). At the empirical level, Entringer et al. (2021b) reported very high correlations between
five established communion scales (𝑟̅ = .72). With permission, we used Entringer et al.’s (2021b)
data and found that the BFI-Agreeableness Scale correlated just as highly with the five
established communion scales (𝑟̅ = .75). In all, we would predict corresponding results between
communion and agreeableness, but not between agency and any of the Big Five. The predicted
pattern would dovetail with previous research on the similarities and differences in the
nomological networks of the Big Two and the Big Five (Eck & Gebauer, 2022, 2024).
We sought to explain national variation in status differences in agentic and communal
self-concepts with the help of eleven national characteristics. We chose those characteristics a
priori (with one exception ) because we considered them to be most relevant according to
existent research. But, of course, other national characteristics may be relevant. The present
manuscript provides all the means needed for scholars to test their candidate characteristic
(against ours). Specifically, Online Supplements S10-S11 include effect size estimates of status
differences in agentic and communal self-concepts, separately for each nation. Those effect size
estimates can be fed into a meta-analysis in which each nation is considered a separate sample.
Meta-regression (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001; Wilson, 2006) can then be used to test whether an
additional national characteristic can help explain national variation in status differences in
agentic and communal self-concepts. This meta-regression approach can be considered a
conceptual analog to our mixed-models approach (Entringer et al., 2023). Meta-regression can
also incorporate multiple sample-level moderators (here: nation-level moderators) at the same
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 53
time and, thus, researchers can test whether their candidate national characteristic is helpful over
and above our three characteristics (i.e., national religiosity, pathogen load, income inequality).
We used 11 national characteristics all of which came from external sources (most often
the world bank). If possible, we used the national characteristic from the very year the participant
took part in the study. This approach was not possible for all national characteristics, because not
all characteristics were available for each year within the study period (see footnote 4). Notably,
though, characteristics were always available from time-periods close to the main study period
(again, see footnote 4). At the same time, none of our characteristics showed drastic rank-order
changes within the study period. The average intercorrelation between the yearly indicators per
national characteristics ranged from r = .73 for unemployment rate to r = .99 for fertility rate
with an average of 𝑟̅ = .93. Thus, we do not believe that differential availability of yearly data
advantaged some national characteristics over others. In fact, religiosity and pathogen load both
performed exceptionally well, even though the availability of yearly data for those measures was
particularly limited. Still, yearly data on our national characteristics will become more readily
available in the future and future research can, then, use those more precise data.
Socioeconomic-status differences in agentic and communal self-concepts were no cross-
cultural universals. Instead, they varied considerably across nations. In addition, they may also
vary within nations, say, across federal states and within federal states, say, across cities. One
large-scale study, for example, examined the well-being benefits of religiosity and found those
benefits magnified in religious nations and, independent of this, in religious federal states within
nations and, independent of that, in religious cities within federal states (and nations) (Gebauer et
al., 2017a; cf. Entringer et al., 2021a). As a result, the well-being benefits of religiosity were
particularly large in the most religious city of the most religious state of the most religious
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 54
nation. Conversely, those benefits were absent altogether in the most secular city of the most
secular state of the most secular nation. It is, thus, conceivable that socioeconomic-status
differences in agentic self-concepts vanish altogether in the most religious city of the most
religious state of the most religious nation. Conversely, the same differences may be particularly
pronounced in the most secular city of the most secular state of the most secular nation. Future
research may want to examine regional differences (cities, states) in addition to national
differences (cf. Ebert et al., 2022a, 2022b).
The IPP dataset was well suited to examine our research questions. Specifically, the
dataset is extremely large, includes data from many different nations, and provides multiple
measures of socioeconomic status alongside a direct measure of agentic and communal self-
concepts (in three variants). Yet, as with all datasets, the IPP also has its limitations. For one
thing, the BFI-Big Two Scales (Entringer et al., 2021b) and their items (John et al., 1991) were
constructed based on data from North American participants. These participants completed the
items in English language—the mother tongue for most of those participants. This raises the
question of whether our scales were appropriate in all 133 IPP-nations. In an effort to assure
appropriateness, we exclusively used the three variants of the BFI-Big Two Scales that have
evidenced sufficient levels of measurement invariance across all nations of the IPP and we
excluded the one variant that did not evidence sufficient invariance (Gebauer et al., 2020). We
consider our approach acceptable, but far from ideal as it has almost certainly imposed etic bias
(Cheung et al., 2011; van de Vijver, 2013). Ideally, we would seek to replicate our results with a
dataset that is based on an emic (indigenous) approach or on a combined emic-etic approach
(Cheung et al., 2011; van de Vijver, 2013). Indeed, Thalmayer et al. (2024) have just introduced
a measure of the Big Two that comes very close to the aforementioned ideal and we hope that it
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 55
will soon be implemented in large-scale cross-cultural studies. If so, the necessary data may
become available in a few years to attempt replication of the present research with superior
measures of agency and communion.
Another limitation of the IPP is that its data is cross-sectional by nature and, thus, it is
possible that some of the shared variance between socioeconomic status and agentic and
communal self-concepts is due to an effect of the latter on the former (e.g., people with agentic
self-concepts may achieve more socioeconomic success). Notably, analyses involving the
socioeconomic status of our participants’ parents yielded results conceptually identical to the
results involving participants’ own socioeconomic status. This renders it less likely that the
association between status and self-concepts is entirely (or even largely) driven by effects of the
latter on the former. Still, appropriate longitudinal studies are a necessary next step.
Further, the results were similar for our three measures of socioeconomic status (self-
categorization into classes, occupational status, categorization of parents into classes), and they
were also similar when weighing for sex, age, education, and nationality. However, Online
Supplements S19-S21 show that the results were different when education (personal and
parental) was used as alternative measures of socioeconomic status. We note that education is a
more distal measure of status than are our three main-text measures (Berkessel et al., 2021) and
we have used education for a different purpose in the present research—namely, to weigh our
data, thereby rendering the data more nation representative. Nonetheless, future research should
seek to understand the precise reasons for why the results for education differ so markedly from
those of self-categorization into social classes, occupational status, and categorization of parents
into social classes. One possible approach may be to treat socioeconomic status and education as
two independent predictors within the same model and specify the interaction between the two
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 56
(e.g., is the association between socioeconomic status and an agentic self-concept particularly
strong for people with lower levels of education?).
Finally, we decidedly focused on agentic and communal self-concepts and, thus, on
people’s subjective perception of their own agency and communion. These self-concepts are
important and consequential in their own right (Bandura, 1982; Helgeson, 1994). But, like all
self-concept research, our research raises the question as to what degree the self-concept is a
reflection of people’s agentic and communal behavior and to what degree the self-concept is
biased by various forms of self-enhancement (Sedikides, 2022; Sedikides & Gregg, 2008), self-
stereotyping (Guimond et al., 2006; Simon & Hamilton, 1994), and many other self-perception
biases (Dunning et al., 2004; Robins & John, 1997).
Coda
Direct research on socioeconomic-status differences in agentic and communal self-
concepts has been scarce (Abele, 2003). The present research sought to help fill this void. We
relied on a large dataset from many nations and we used several well-suited measures of
socioeconomic status and the Big Two self-concept. Across nations, we found that people of
higher status considered themselves more agentic than did people of lower status. The size of this
effect was similar to the average effect size in social-personality psychology. We also found that
people of lower status considered themselves somewhat more communal than did people of
higher status. That effect size, however, was much smaller than average in social-personality
psychology and probably negligible for most practical purposes. Of particular interest, we found
significant national variation in both effects: Status differences in agentic self-concepts were
reduced in nations with higher religiosity and also in nations with higher pathogen load. Status
differences in communal self-concepts were amplified in nations with higher income inequality.
Socioeconomic-Status Differences in Self-Concepts 57
If those cross-cultural differences generalize to cross-temporal differences within nations, the
western world will face rising differences in the self-concepts between the richer and the poorer
people in society, because national religiosity and pathogen load are both decreasing, whereas
income inequality is increasing. The issue is of much social relevance and deserves close
attention from social scientists and policy makers.
