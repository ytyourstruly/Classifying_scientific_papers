The Development and Validation of the Language Competencies Anxiety Scale (LCAS):
Measuring reading, writing, listening, and speaking anxiety in any learning context
Abstract
While language anxiety (LA) has received much attention in applied linguistics, existing
tools for measuring LA are overtly focused on oral language competence-related anxiety
experienced by traditional foreign language learners. To fill this gap, we have developed a
Language Competencies Anxiety Scales (LCAS), to measure LA in reading, writing,
listening, and speaking in any context in- and outside of the foreign language classroom.
Three language learning groups were included in the study: (1) Traditional foreign language
learners, (2) heritage language learners, and (3) online language learners. Online language
learners consisted mainly of self-driven learners not enrolled in language classes. The 20
strongest items were selected based on item analysis and principle component analysis and
included in the final LCAS. Results of the LCAS demonstrated significantly lower LA levels
for heritage language (HL) learners compared to traditional- and online language learners.
Differences between online language learners and traditional language learners could also be
observed, though only significant for the reading and writing sub-scales. Our findings suggest
that LA levels vary between different language learning groups, both with respect to context
and language competencies. The LCAS can be used as a tool to expand our understanding of
LA by targeting a diverse group of language learners.

The Development and Validation of the Language Competencies Anxiety Scale (LCAS):
Measuring reading, writing, listening, and speaking anxiety in any learning context
Language competency development is influenced by a multitude of factors, including
affective dimensions. The impending effects of language anxiety (LA) on language learning,
language achievement and language maintenance have long been recognized (Horwitz 2001;
Scovel 1978; Sevinç 2016). LA and in particular foreign language anxiety (FLA) has
constituted the subject of numerous studies for the past few decades. Language anxiety is a
complex phenomenon that can be described as ‘a distinct complex of self‐perceptions,
beliefs, feelings, and behaviors related to classroom language learning arising from the
uniqueness of the language learning process’ (Horwitz et al. 1986: 128). Most studies have
focused on the link between oral communication skills and LA, demonstrating a positive
correlation between low self-perceived competence and LA (MacIntyre et al., 1997; Szyszka,
2011). Thus, LA leads to less language use and ultimately hinders the acquisition of language
competency.
Most studies on FLA use Horwitz et al´s (1968) Foreign language classroom
anxiety scale (FLCAS) to measure and analyze pupils´ experiences with LA. While the
FCLAS has been proven a reliable and valid tool to measure LA, its application is limited to
the traditional language-learning context. It excludes specific groups such as heritage
language learners, who often do not attend traditional language classes, or people who learn
languages online or through dedicated apps such as Duolingo. Not only has increasing
globalization and migration led to various forms of language immersion, but the rapid
progress in technology has meant that languages are learnt online through the use of social
media, language apps, gaming communities and many other virtual spaces (Kabilan et al.
2010; Ryu 2013). In addition, the strong focus on speaking anxiety in the current FLCAS
creates another significant constraint. Previous studies have provided evidence that other
language competencies (listening, reading and writing) are also worth exploring with respect
to LA, in particular with respect to non-traditional language learners (Xiao and Wong 2014).
As such, there is a need to adapt, develop and validate a scale that measures
competency specific anxiety that is not specific to traditional classroom learning. The first
aim of this study is to create and validate a skill-based LA scale that considers the outlined
limitations of the FLCAS. Secondly, this study aims to explore differences in LA scores
between traditional and non-traditional language learners, which may inspire further research
into LA beyond the FL classroom. The next section will start by providing a critical overview
of LA research and existing LA scales, followed by reviewing the state of art of LA studies
exploring the non-traditional language learning context. In the subsequent sections, we
present details of our scale development and methodology and lastly our findings. These
findings are then discussed both with respect to the reliability of our scale as well as the
implications of our findings regarding LA between traditional and non-traditional language
learners. To conclude, we offer suggestions for further research.
LITERATURE REVIEW
A brief overview of language anxiety research
Over time, definitions of FLA have changed repetitively, MacIntyre (2017) classified these
changes into the following three approaches (1) the confounded phase, (2) the specialized
approach and (3) the dynamic approach. During the confounded phase, no language specific
measure had yet been developed and therefore measures from psychology were adapted,
leading to conflicting results (Scovel 1978; MaCIntyre 2017). Specifically, FLA appeared to
have a facilitating effect in some of these early studies, which later could be explained by
either the use of ill-suited measures or the lack of distinguishing between- and the lack of
definitions for different types of anxiety, such as test anxiety and public speaking anxiety.
The confounded phase was followed by the situation-specific approach, which was largely
influenced by Horwitz et al´s (1968) development of the FLCAS. The scale consist of 33
statements that refer to situations commonly encountered in the foreign language classroom,
such as item (13) “It embarrasses me to volunteer answers in my language class.” (Horwitz
et al. 1986). The FLCAS items mainly relate to situations referring to oral performance. This
can be problematic, considering that other competencies (writing, reading and listening) have
also been found to be anxiety-provoking and are overlooked in the FLCAS (Saito et al. 1999;
Pae, 2013; Piniel, 2024). Nevertheless, the FLCAS has been the main tool used in FLA
studies around the world and thus has been translated into many languages and applied in
numerous contexts. The dynamic approach is the final and most recent approach, recognizing
LA as a dynamic construct that encompasses various dimensions, incuding psychological,
physiological and social. These different factors are in constant interaction with each other
and need to be considered when examining LA (MaCIntyre 2017). While numerous studies
have correlated results from the FCLAS with a great variety of variables, only few studies
have attempted to revise or adapt the FCLAS to contexts other than the traditional foreign
language classroom (e.g. Tallon 2006). This leaves a major gap in LA research, since the
endeavor of language study has long occurred outside the foreign language classroom
context.
Language anxiety beyond the foreign language classroom context
Since the global pandemic, a growing number of studies have shown interest in
exploring FLA in online language learning contexts (Maican and Cocoradă 2021; Resnik and
Dewaele 2021; Dewaele et al. 2024). Earlier research had already demonstrated that
emotional experiences and sources of FLA in online language learning spaces differ to the
traditional face-to-face language-learning environment, which may elevate or decrease
anxiety levels (Hurd 2007; Pichette 2009; Marchand and Gutierrez 2012; McNeil 2014).
Some studies reported that anxious students might enroll in online language classes due to the
expectation that there is less oral interaction in online classes compared to face-to-face
classes (Pichette 2009; Russell 2016). However, since then technological advances have led
to many novice tools to support and optimize online language learning. Russell (2018)
observed FLA levels of students in regular online classes throughout a semester and found
that FLA levels decreased significantly with the progression of the semester. Hence,
familiarization with the online language class environment could partially minimize
experiences of FLA (Russell 2018; Russell 2020).
Studies conducted during and following the pandemic showed that the online
language learning context bears both distinct challenges and advantages with respect to FLA
compared to the physical classroom context (García-Castro and O’Reilly 2022; Dewaele et
al. 2024; Resnik et al. 2023). For example, Resnik et al. (2023) found that in online language
classes, students appeared to be significantly less anxious about how their performance
compared to their peers and physiological symptoms of anxiety were less commonly
experienced than in in-person classes. However, learning languages online does not only
occur in the form of proper language classes.
Language learning applications, social media and different types of online forums
provide several avenues to study and improve language skills (Kabilan et al. 2010; Ryu
2013). The few studies that exist suggest that the use of social media as well as interactive
games and online elements can reduce FLA and enhance vocabulary learning as well as
specific language skills (Grant et al. 2018; Jin 2023, 2024; Yang et al. 2024). These studies
all use the original or an adapted version of the FLCAS as at least one measure to capture
participants´ FLA. This is possible since most of these studies were carried out in school or
college settings, splitting participant into control groups and groups incorporating social
media or online gamification elements to assess its impact on FLA (Jin 2023, 2024; Yang et
al. 2024).
Another non-traditional language learning group are heritage language users. A
heritage language (HL) is passed down from one generation to the next and its use is often
linked to family settings and other non-academic contexts (Sevinç and Dewaele 2018).
Previous studies investigating HLA have found that HL users tend to experience less LA as
opposed to FL learners (Jee, 2016; Tallon, 2009, 2011, 2014). Most HLA studies used or
adapted scales developed for FL learners (Tallon, 2009; Jee, 2016; Xiao & Wong, 2014),
which have not been validated for the HL context. With respect to different language
competencies, HL studies that have included skill-based anxiety scales demonstrate that
writing is the most anxiety-provoking skill, followed by reading anxiety while speaking and
listening anxiety ranked lowest (Jee, 2016; Xiao & Wong, 2014). These studies focused on
HL users that were enrolled in heritage-track classes at University. Studies that explore skill-
based HLA outside of the classroom-based language learning context have been neglected.
Sevinç and Dewaele (2018) explore HLA and majority language anxiety (MLA) experienced
by Turkish immigrants in the Netherlands. Instead of using a skill-focused LA scale, they
used a 9 item scale to explore which situations and interlocutors (family, friends or Turks in
Turkey) were most anxiety-provoking when using the HL. They found that levels of HLA
varied according to generations, with third generation immigrants experiencing HLA across
all situations and with all interlocutors. The study highlights the complexity of the HL
context and the many extra linguistic factors that need to be considered when exploring HLA.
Both FL- and HL learners may resort to online spaces to develop and upkeep their
language skills. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no current studies exist examining the
effect of digital communication technologies on FLA outside the traditional classroom
context. This may explain the lack of suitable instruments. On the other hand, a number of
studies have investigated HLA, yet no appropriate LA scale has been designed for the HL
context either. This illustrates the need to develop an instrument applicable to diverse
language learning contexts to delve into emotional experiences and in particular LA beyond
the FL classroom.
Existing language anxiety scales
Despite the overwhelming interest in LA, predominantly FLA, the FLCAS is the
primary, validated quantitative instrument applied to measure LA on a global level. As the
original FLCAS consists of 33 items, a short-version of the scale was developed by
MacIntyre (1992) in his doctoral dissertation. Following the publication of an article by
Dewaele and MacIntyre´s (2014) using the short-FLCAS (S-FLCAS), the 8 item scale has
received much attention and has since been used in numerous studies. This led to the recent
validation of the S-FLCAS by Botes et al. (2022), confirming its reliability and validity. In
addition, a few scales have been developed focusing on FLA relating to specific language
competencies: speaking, reading, listening and writing (Apple, 2012; Cheng, 2004; Kim,
the scales that have been developed or adapted, specified by the context and competencies in
focus.

Saito et al. (1999) initiated research into competency-specific anxiety, by developing
a preliminary Foreign Language Reading Anxiety Scale (FLRAS) containing 20 items. Saito
et al.´s (1999) study helped recognizing reading anxiety as a separate yet related construct
with respect to general foreign language anxiety. Nevertheless, not many studies have
investigated FLRA and no further development or statistical analysis of the FLRAS has been
conducted. Following Saito et al.´s (1999) study, several other skill-based anxiety scales were
developed (see Kim, 2000; Cheng, 2004; Apple, 2013). While some of these scales have been
tested for reliability and validity, replicative studies are lacking and research on skill-based
anxiety in different contexts remains substantially underexplored.
Scales aiming for a multiple competencies approach to LA are similarly scarce (Pae
2013; Cheng 2017; Kutuk et al. 2020; Piniel 2024). Pae (2013) examined whether the four
skilled-based anxieties can be captured by a more general foreign language classroom anxiety
construct or whether each skill makes an independent contribution to FLCA. The analysis
revealed that each skilled-based anxiety should be considered an independent construct and
thus future LA research should pay equal attention to the four language skills (Pae 2013).
However, Pae´s (2013) study includes a total of 115 scale items, undoubtedly affecting the
replicability and validity of the results.
The most recent tool for measuring skills-specific LA was constructed by Piniel
(2024). She criticized the length of some of the existing skill-based anxiety scales as well as
the fact that all apply Classical Test Theory (CTT) in their validity and reliability analyses.
As such, taking an Item Response Theory (IRT) approach, Piniel (2024) created a 28 items
Skills-based Foreign Language Anxiety instrument. Internal consistency of the speaking,
writing and listening sub-scales were adequate (α =.75 to .87), yet the value for the reading
anxiety scale was inadequate (α =.51). The reading anxiety scale was also the shortest with
only 5 items, compared to 6 items for listening anxiety, 8 items for writing anxiety and 9
items for speaking anxiety (Piniel, 2024). The study represented a first foray into developing
a skill-based anxiety instrument using IRT, however due to the low sample size (n = 134) and
first validation attempt utilizing only four secondary schools in Hungary, further validation is
needed.
Furthermore, all reviewed skill-based and multiple-skill-based anxiety scales were
focused on the traditional foreign language classroom environment using relatively
homogenous samples: University students, with the exception of Piniel´s (2024) study, which
focused on secondary school students, who study English as a foreign language (e.g. Cheng
2017; Kutuk et al. 2020). Furthermore, since the scales were distributed in specific languages
and cultural contexts, e.g. Korea (Kim 2005), Taiwan (Cheng 2004) Japan (Apple 2013), the
findings and predictions of influential factors for LA cannot be generalized.
There is an apparent lack of LA scales aimed at non-traditional language learners.
While some studies have adapted the FLCAS to other contexts (e.g. the heritage language
learning context), these modified versions of the FLCAS have never been validated or used
across multiple studies. For his doctoral dissertation, Tallon (2006) explored if and to what
degree heritage language (HL) speakers of Spanish experience FLA. In two pilot studies,
Tallon (2014) found that some HL speakers had lower levels of anxiety compared to
traditional language learners and that some HL speakers experienced anxiety for specific
language skills while others did not, prompting the need to further investigate the sources of
FLA in heritage speakers and potential differences in comparison with foreign language
learners (Tallon, 2006). For participants with a heritage language background, Tallon (2006)
added 7 items to the original 33-items FLCAS: e.g. ‘I am comfortable when speaking Spanish
with family members who speak Spanish fluently.’ However, Tallon´s (2006) Preliminary
Heritage Language Anxiety Scale has not been further developed or validated.
METHOD
Participants
A total of n = 465 international participants were recruited online using snowball
sampling. The average age of the participants were 33.56 years old (SD = 16.204). The
majority of participants were female (n = 227), with n = 154 male participants, n = 21 non-
binary participants, and n = 13 participants not disclosing gender. The majority of
participants were from China (n = 94), followed by the United States (n = 91), and Germany
(n = 83). Participants indicated an average of 2.83 languages (SD = 1.458) in their linguistic
repertoire, with the majority having L1 English (n = 167), followed by L1 Chinese (n = 111),
and L1 German (n = 93). Furthermore, all participants were learning an additional language,
with the majority learning a heritage language (n = 190), followed by self-directed learners
using online tools and apps (n = 160), and foreign language learners enrolled in traditional in-
person language classes (n = 115). Of the n = 160 online language learners, n = 44 indicated
that they have (currently or in the past) taken part in online language learning classes,
whereas the rest of the subsample only utilized self-study techniques such as apps, social
media, books, and media to learn languages. Additional information regarding nationalities
and L1’s of participants can be found in the Supplementary Materials.
Instruments
In addition to the newly developed and validated LCAS developed in this study, the
following instruments were also administered in order to explore validity. All items were
measured on a 5-point Likert scale from ‘strongly disagree’ to ‘strongly agree’.
Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (BFNES): The BFNES consists of 12-items
designed to measure general social anxiety (Carleton, 2006). The scale administered deviated
from the original in one aspect, a single item was reverse-scored in order to serve as an
attention-check in the questionnaire, this item was worded as “I rarely worry about what kind
of impression I am making on someone”. The scale displayed adequate internal consistency
(α = .911).
Abbreviated Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ-A): The PSWQ-A consists of 8-
items capturing a general indication of worry and anxiety (Hopko et al., 2003), with items
such as ‘My worries overwhelm me’. The internal consistency of the PSWQ-A was
acceptable (α = .936).
Short-form Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (S-FLCAS): The 8-item S-
FLCAS measures anxiety within the foreign language classroom with items such as ‘It
embarrasses me to volunteer answers in my FL class’. The eight items of the scale were
selected from the original 33-item Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS;
Horwitz et al., 1986) by MacIntyre (1992) and recently validated by Botes et al. (2022). The
internal consistency of the scale was acceptable (α = .709). It should be noted that as the S-
FLCAS is designed to measure language anxiety within the context of classroom-based
foreign language learning, the instrument was only administered to participants indicating
that they were indeed enrolled in foreign language classes (n = 115).
Descriptive statistics of each of the additional instruments utilized in the study can be
found in the Supplementary Materials.
Data Analysis
Step 1: Generating the LCAS item pool
The aim of this study was to develop a measure of language anxiety specific to each
language competency (reading, writing, listening, and speaking) that can be utilized within
any context of language learning, such as the context of foreign language classrooms, self-
driven learning, and heritage language learning. As such, an item pool was needed with items
measuring language learning reading anxiety, writing anxiety, listening anxiety, and speaking
anxiety. This item pool was generated by adapting existing measures through a set criteria
that the scale can be used in a variety of contexts, 2) ensure that the items was specific to a
language competency (reading, writing, listening, and speaking), and 3) ensure that the item
was age inclusive.

Items regarding speaking anxiety were adapted from the FLCAS (Horwitz et al.,
1986) and Tallon´s (2006) preliminary heritage language anxiety scale. A total of 14 items
were generated to be considered for the LCAS. Listening anxiety items were adapted from
the Foreign Language Listening Anxiety Scale (Kim, 2002) and a total of 10 items were
included in the item pool. A further 12 items were adapted from the Foreign Language
Reading Anxiety Scale (Saito et al., 1999) in order to capture reading specific language
anxiety. Lastly, 11 items were adapted from the Second Language Writing Anxiety Inventory
(Cheng, 2004) and added to the item pool as writing specific language anxiety items.
After the generation of the item pool, a pilot study of n = 6 adolescent heritage
language learners was conducted, where the participants provided feedback regarding the
clarity of items. Ambiguous items were adapted following the pilot study. The full item pool
can be found in the Supplementary Materials (see Section C).
Step 2: Item Selection
The full item pool of 47 items generated in Step 1 was tested on the n = 465
participants. Subsequently, the strongest items were identified for inclusion in the LCAS
using item analysis and principle component analysis (PCA). First, each competency-specific
subscale was independently analysed for inter-item correlations, internal consistency, and
factor loadings via SPSS 25. Promax rotation was utilized as inter-factor correlations would
be expected (Tóth, 2008) and factor structure was determined via the Kaiser-criterion and a
visual inspection of the scree plot. For each competency specific subscale, the goal was to
identify the five strongest items with moderate to large inter-item correlations, large internal
consistencies, and large, unidimensional factor loadings (see Botes et al., 2022). Next, a
single PCA with the selected 20 items was performed.
Step 3: Confirming the LCAS Structure
A series of competing confirmatory factor models (CFAs) were tested in order to
confirm the factor structure of the proposed LCAS. A higher-order model, a correlating
model, a bifactor model, and a unidimensional model were tested with fit indices compared in
in JASP (version 0.18.3; JASP Team, 2024). Maximum likelihood with standardized errors
were used to estimate all CFA models. There were no missing values. Model fit was
determined via the Comparative Fit Index (CFI; close fit ≥ .95; reasonable fit ≥ .90), Tucker-
Lewis Index (TLI; close fit ≥ .95; reasonable fit ≥ .90), Root Mean Square Error of
Approximation (RMSEA; close fit ≤ .05; reasonable fit ≤ .08), and the Standardised Root
Mean Square Residual (SRMR; close fit ≤ .05; reasonable fit ≤ .08; Kenny, 2020). The four
measurement models tested were compared via the χ difference test (Kline, 2023).
Competing CFA Models
Correlated Model Higher Order Model
Bifactor Model Unidimensional Model
Step 4: Validating the LCAS
Reliability was examined via the Cronbach alpha as a measure of internal consistency
for each subscale independently as well as for the LCAS as a whole.
Convergent and discriminant validity were examined via correlations with participant
scores on the newly developed LCAS and the BFNES, PSWQ-A, and the S-FLCAS. The
BFNES captured social anxiety, the PSWQ-A measured general anxiety, and S-FLCAS
measured foreign language anxiety. It is expected that the LCAS will share small to moderate
correlations with the average scores on each of these scales, as anxiety measures are often
moderately related (convergent validity; see Botes et al., 2022). However, large correlations
may be indicative of a lack of discriminant validity. Furthermore, internal discriminant
validity across the four subscales of the LCAS was examined via the Average Variance
Extracted (AVE) analysis. The AVE value of each subscale was compared with the squared
inter-subscale correlation coefficients (Farrell, 2010), where discriminant validity was
supported if the AVE values exceeded the squared correlation coefficients (Hair et al., 2006;
Botes et al., 2021).
Step 5: Group-Level Differences
The final version of the LCAS was utilized to compare levels of language anxiety
across the three types of language learners in the study, namely heritage language learners (n
= 190), self-driven online foreign language learners (n = 160), and traditional classroom
foreign language learners (n = 115). Group-level mean differences were examined via a series
of ANOVAs with Tukey post-hoc analyses (Field, 2013) using SPSS 25.
RESULTS
Step 1 & 2 :Item Selection
Item selection occurred individually per competency subscale. The potential items for
each subscale was examined for inter-item correlations, internal consistency, and factor
loadings. For each subscale the five items with the largest internal consistency, factor
loadings, and inter-item correlations were selected. In addition, the factor structure as
indicated by the PCA was examined, with items not selected if they did not conform to a
unidimensional structure. The analyses for each individual subscale can be found in the
Supplementary Materials (see Section C). Therefore, in total 20 items (five per competency
subscale) were selected for the LCAS. The descriptive statistics of the four subscales and the

A PCA was conducted on the 20-item scale using the Kiaser-criterion. The PCA resulted in a
three factor solution, with speaking anxiety and listening anxiety loading onto one factor. As
speaking and listening competencies have been found to be closely related (see Tavil, 2010;
Ziane, 2011) it may be that participants responded similarly to items in these subscales.
Consequently, an additional PCA was conducted with four factors specified in order to
examine whether items would group according to competency if the amount of factors were
forced. The forced four-factor PCA yielded a factor solution where each factor captured a
solution resulted in no cross-loadings of factors and items divided neatly across
competencies, the decision was made to proceed with the CFA models.

Step 3: Confirmatory Factor Analyses
Four CFA models were analysed in order to determine the underlying structure of the
newly developed LCAS. A correlational model, higher-order model, bifactor model, and
it should be noted that both the higher-order solution and the correlated solution displayed
reasonably close fit and can possibly be considered for use in future latent models, depending
on the research question at hand. The single factor solution displayed poor fit and as such a
unidimensional model should not be considered. The selection of the bifactor solution for the
LCAS also implies that for future research utilizing manifest variables, both a total LCAS
score and subscale scores can be used.

Step 4: Reliability and Validity
The LCAS overall had an excellent internal consistency (α = .952), with each of the
subscales also displaying good internal consistencies (Speaking Anxiety: α = .931; Listening
Anxiety: α = .878; Writing Anxiety: α = .864; Speaking Anxiety: α = .896).
The convergent and discriminant validity of the LCAS as tested via correlations with
related variables were supported. Each of the subscales as well as the overall LCAS scores
were moderately correlated with fear of negative evaluation as measured via the BFNES and
in the sample enrolled in traditional language classes also completed the S-FLCAS (n = 115).
The LCAS and competency subscales correlated moderately with foreign language classroom
anxiety, with the exception of speaking anxiety that correlated strongly with average scores
on the S-FLCAS ( r = .858; p < .001). This finding supports previous criticisms of the
FLCAS in that it is overly weighted towards speaking anxiety (Botes et al., 2020).

Step 5: Group-Level Differences
In previous steps, the LCAS was developed and found to be a valid and reliable
instrument. As such, the instrument was used to examine whether group-level differences in
anxiety experienced in language learning differed across heritage language learners, online
self-driven foreign language learners, and traditional foreign classroom language learners. A
series of ANOVAs found group level differences across the means of LCAS and its subscales
for the different types of language learners.
The ANOVA for language learning speaking anxiety was statistically significant (F
(2, 462) = 89.664; p < .001). Furthermore, post-hoc analysis indicated that heritage language
learners had statistically significantly (p < .001) lower levels of language learning speaking
anxiety as compared to online self-driven foreign language learners and traditional classroom
speaking anxiety was found between online and traditional learners. Similarly, language
learning listening anxiety was found to have a significant ANOVA (F (2, 462) = 145.333; p <
.001), with significant post-hoc mean differences between heritage language learners and
online or traditional language learners (p < .001) and no significant differences between
traditional classroom learners and self-driven online learners (p > .05). In contrast, both
language learning writing anxiety (F (2, 434) = 55.032; p < .001) and language learning
reading anxiety (F (2, 462) = 76.954; p < .001) both had significant post-hoc mean
the 20-item LCAS was also found to significantly differ across groups (F (2, 434) = 116.728;
p < .001), with all types of language learners differing significantly in terms of mean
differences.

DISCUSSION
The apparent lack of skill-based LA measures beyond the traditional FL classroom led
us to develop a Language Competencies Anxiety Scale (LCAS ) that can be used in
traditional language learning-, online language learning-, and heritage language learning
contexts. A total of 47 items were included and tested on participants (n = 465) belonging to
either of the three language learning groups. Based on item analysis and PCA, the five
strongest items for each competency sub-scale were selected. The final 20 scale items have
proven to constitute excellent reliability and validity. The bifactor model was found to be the
best fit for CFA, meaning that depending on the research questions and skills one wants to
explore, the whole-scale scores or only the subscale scores can be utilized. Additionally, both
the correlational model and higher-order model can be considered for future studies using the
LCAS.
A second aim of the study was to explore differences in LA scores between traditional
and non-traditional language learning groups. Lower LA scores were consistently found for
the HL group in comparison with FL learners in both the online language learning- and
traditional language learning groups. Overall, LA scores were found to be highest for
language learners in traditional classroom settings. However, the difference between
traditional and online language learners was only significant with respect to reading and
writing anxiety. This may be explained by the fact that many online language learners only
read and write in their FL in non-academic settings. For example, they may write on social
media or gaming chats, where the fear of being judged by an authority (e.g. teacher) is absent
when compared to the traditional language learning context. As such, certain situations
included in the writing anxiety scale (e.g. ‘I freeze up when unexpectedly asked to write in
my HL/FL’) may rarely apply to certain types of online language learners. Similarly, the
content and purpose of reading in a FL may differ greatly between online language learners
and traditional language learners. Online language learners may primarily read content they
are interested in (e.g. on social media platforms) while traditional language learners may be
“forced” to read about topics they are not interested in or unfamiliar with. This difference
between language learning groups may subsequently explain LA scores with respect to
certain scale items (e.g. ‘I am nervous when I am reading a paragraph in my HL/FL when I
am not familiar with the topic’).
Online language learners may also feel less anxious and nervous when using language
learning apps, since there often is no time limit to reading and easy access to online language
tools is granted. Hence, more time, anonymity, and readily available language resources in
virtual spaces may contribute to greater comfort when reading and writing in a FL. These
findings align with previous studies comparing FLA scores between in-person and remote
language classes (Resnik & Dewaele, 202; Resnik et al., 2023; Dewaele et al., 2024). The
factors contributing to lower FLA in the remote language classes can be summarized as
follows: (1) Increased anonymity, (2) reduced worry about peer comparisons, (3) reduced
worry regarding insufficient preparation, (4) reduced fear of making errors, (5) reduced
physical symptoms of FLA and (6) generally lower emotional arousal (Resnik & Dewaele,
202; Resnik et al., 2023; Dewaele et al., 2024). Thus, in comparison with the remote
language learning context, participants in Dewaele et al.´s (2024) study experienced more
FLA, more foreign language enjoyment (FLE) and less foreign language boredom (FLB) in
the in-person language classes. Anxiety-provoking factors in the remote language classes
mainly related to technology and unambiguity about assignment requirements (Dewaele et
al., 2024). However, it is important to note that these studies focused on only one type of
online language learning: online language classes consisting of a group of students and a
teacher (Resnik & Dewaele, 202; Resnik et al., 2023; Dewaele et al., 2024). In our study,
only some participants stated that they attend online language classes, including both group-
and one-on-one language classes. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between different
types of online language learners and future studies should investigate and compare LA
levels between diverse online language learning contexts (e.g. online language classes,
gaming and language apps).
Regarding HL learners, a number of factors are worth exploring with respect to the
observed low HLA levels in our study as well as previous studies. First, heightened
familiarity of- and natural exposure to the HL at home and often from birth may eliminate
one aspect of LA that is typically found in the FL context. Since many HL learners do not
learn or maintain their HL in a classroom setting, using the HL for activities outside one´s
comfort zone is often a choice. To illustrate, while writing appears to be the most anxiety-
provoking competency in the HL context, HL learners may seldom encounter situations, in
which writing in the HL is the only option. This stands in stark contrast to the traditional FL
classroom environment. Generational differences mark another distinctive feature influencing
LA levels in the HL context. Previous studies have shown that HLA levels increase with each
successive generation of immigrants (Sevinç & Dewaele, 2018; Jee, 2022). Our study
included a mix of generations with a majority of first generation immigrants, which may
partially explain the low HLA scores. Lastly and arguably most importantly, earlier studies
on HLA emphasize that experiences of LA in the HL context are closely intertwined with a
number of complex sociolinguistic and socioemotional factors (Sevinç & Dewaele, 2018;
Sevinç, 2020). To explore these factors and ultimately gain a better understanding of HL
learners´ unique experiences of LA, an interdisciplinary approach using mixed-methods is
strongly encouraged (Sevinç & Dewaele, 2018; Sevinç, 2020).
By developing and validating a LCAS suitable for different language learning
contexts, we have provided a starting point for more inclusive LA research. Our study has
demonstrated that LA levels vary between different language learning groups and
competencies. Further research should utilize the LCAS for a variety of language learning
groups and contexts. It may also be interesting to include other affective factors that have
proven to impact LA levels (e.g. motivation) in previous studies (Luo, 2015). As such, we
advocate for the use of LCAS for adolescent and adult language learners within any context
(traditional, online, or heritage) of language learning.
Limitations and Future Research Recommendations
Several limitations have to be considered. Firstly, the LCAS did show reliability and
validity evidence in this study, however our sample was recruited across the world using
snowball sampling. As such, no comparisons were made across cultural and language
settings. As language emotions have been found to differ across cultures (Azari Noughabi et
al., 2022), future research examining the LCAS within specific cultural contexts is needed.
Furthermore, the LCAS is only available in English and the development and validation of
translated versions can be a fruitful future research avenue to explore. Furthermore, the
LCAS captures LA within the context of a specific working definition of LA – where LA is
tied to the specific language competency. As such, future research is needed in order to
examine how LA as measured by the LCAS is embedded in the larger nomological network
of language learning. For example, research on foreign language learning has already
established the nomological network of FLCA, with FLCA being negatively related to
foreign language enjoyment (Botes, Dewaele et al. 2022), willingness to communicate (Elahi
Shirvan et al., 2019), and academic achievement in the target language (Botes et al., 2020).
Future research is needed in order to determine how LA as measured by the LCAS is related
to these established constructs in the network of variables. In addition, the sample size in the
current study did not lend itself to invariance testing, as such future research is needed in
order to establish invariance across age, gender, and language proficiency levels. The LCAS
is also not suited for children or younger adolescents and as such future research is needed in
order examine whether the instrument can be reliably used for these age groups. Lastly, the
online language learner group used in this study contained both learners enrolled in online
language classes at some point in their language learning journey and learners who have only
ever used self-directed learning techniques such as Duolingo, media, and social media. Future
research examining the LCAS on more refined online groups, such as learners only utilizing
apps or self-driven learning tools, is needed in order to further establish validity in all sub-
settings of online language learning.
CONCLUSION
Traditional classrooms are no longer the dominant setting for language learning. The
increasing conveniency and accessibility of virtual spaces provides numerous paths for
developing and practicing language skills. Additionally, specific groups, such as HL learners
typically use and maintain their HL in non-academic contexts, including online platforms. In
LA research, these language learners have largely been overseen. Furthermore, no previous
instrument measuring competency-specific LA has been developed for non-traditional
language learners and contexts.
The present study set out to develop a reliable tool to measure skill-based LA beyond
the foreign language classroom. By including three different language groups, our 20-item
LCAS was found to be a valid tool. The current study further explored and identified
differences in LA levels regarding the three language learning groups and the individual
language skills. Traditional language learners experienced more LA than online language
learners and HL learners experienced significantly less LA than the other two groups. By
considering previous research findings and background variables of our participants, we offer
some explanations for this variation. To gain a deeper understanding of non-traditional
language learners´ experiences of skill-based LA, we encourage future studies to investigate
specific language learning groups and contexts using the LCAS.
