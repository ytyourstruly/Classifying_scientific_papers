Abstract
In this dissertation, we investigate the qualitative structure, phenomenology, recollective
experience, and determinants of ‘Flashbulb memories (FBMs)’ – autobiographical recalls of the
circumstances in which an individual learned about an important and emotionally arousing public
event – and their associated ‘Event memories (EMs)’ – non-autobiographical recalls of the event in
itself. Research on FBMs is currently enduring heated theoretical debates about the ‘special status’
of these memories, and their relationship with EMs. We address these issues in light of two chief
hypotheses: (1) FBMs are ‘special’ because of their iconicity, (2) FBMs and EMs rely on different
memory systems. Along these premises, we present a systematic review of literature and three
empirical studies focusing on real-life public events. Along these, we adopt a test-retest
methodology with long retention times to investigate FBMs’ and EMs’ evolution, and the factors
underlying their formation and maintenance. Results of the systematic review show that FBMs are
characterize by exceptional vividness and perceptive features. Building on this, we propose a new
theoretical frame (Studies 1 and 2) in which we identify and characterize ‘perceptive core images’,
a memory component that we argue being crucial in explaining the nature of FBMs and facilitating
their long-term retrieval. Finally, we show (Study 3) that the long-term evolutions of FBMs and
EMs are independent; and that the two are characterized by different recollective processes and
predicted by different factors. Theoretical and practical implications of this frame are discussed.

“Unidirectionality of time is one of nature’s most fundamental laws. It has relentlessly
governed all happenings in the universe—cosmic, geological, physical, biological,
psychological—as long as the universe has existed. Galaxies and stars are born and they die,
living creatures are young before they grow old, causes always precede effects, there is no
return to yesterday, and so on and on. Time’s flow is irreversible.
The singular exception is provided by the human ability to remember past happenings.
[…] When Mother Nature watches her favourite creatures turning one other immutable laws
on its head, she must be pleased with her own creativity.”

CHAPTER 1. General introduction
1.1 Abstract
Autobiographical memory contains the memories of the events of our past. This recollection
does not only entail events we experienced in first hand (e.g., self-defining memories), but also,
memories of the circumstances in which we have learned about important and emotional arousing
public ones. These memories are known as ‘Flashbulb memories (FBMs)’. FBMs carry similar
features to autobiographical memories: they require a subjective time travel and an autonoetic
consciousness of the event, they have reconstructive features, and they are formed and maintained
by the effect of cognitive appraisals and emotion. However, research has shown that they might
actually constitute a ‘special’ class of autobiographical memories, as, besides the above mentioned
characteristics, they additionally seem to have greater longevity, to be recalled with higher
confidence, and to carry exceptional levels of vividness that would render them particularly unique.
Across this Chapter, we will first introduce the phenomenon of FBMs, with an eye on their
qualitative structure, phenomenology, and determinants; as well as a description of the features of
their associated ‘Event memories (EMs)’ – non-autobiographical memories of the facts of the event.
Then, we will hint at the current debate on the nature of FBMs and their relationship with EMs; and
we will finally outline the Chapters constituting the empirical body of this Ph.D. project.
1.2 The formation of flashbulb memories within the autobiographical memory system.
Autobiographical memory, the memory of our everyday personal experiences, is an essential
ingredient in shaping how we perceive ourselves (Berntsen & Rubin, 2012; Williams et al., 2007).
The retention of such recollection is fundamental for making a meaning of our past, to ground our
identity in the present, and to guide our actions in the future (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). To
do so, autobiographical memory is not a literal reproduction of the past, but rather it involves
(re)constructive features (Bartlett, 1932), meaning that elements of information from various
sources are pulled together with the aim to maintain a sense of coherence between one’s past- and
present-self (Conway, Singer, & Tagini, 2004). Autobiographical memory recall therefore requires
a number of components including a sense of subjective time (Tulving, 2002), feelings of
familiarity and personal meaning (Conway & Loveday, 2015), and the retrieval of semantic and
episodic information (Wheeler, Stuss, & Tulving, 1997). In this regard, the recall of
autobiographical events always necessitates a general knowledge of the event in object (i.e.,
semantic memory) and the recollection of our specific, personal interaction with that event (i.e.,
episodic memory). Importantly, what distinguishes these two memory types, is the subjective
experience that accompany them: while the object of semantic memory entails a noetic (i.e.,
knowing) consciousness reflecting the individual’s knowledge of the world, episodic memory
requires an auto-noetic (i.e., self-knowing) consciousness that allows the individual to become
aware of his or her identity in the world with a subjective time that extends from the past through
the present to the future (Tulving, 1985).
From a structural point of view, following Conway and Pleydell-Pearce’s model (2000),
events of our life are hierarchically organized according to their specificity within the so called
‘autobiographical memory system’ (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000). Thus, ‘life themes’
encompass a knowledge at the broadest level (e.g., education), providing cues that can be used to
guide us into the following, more specific levels: ‘life time periods’ (e.g., Ph.D. at the University of
Turin), ‘general events’ (e.g., visiting at the City, University of London), and finally, ‘specific
events’, where episodic memories are formed (e.g., news of the first article accepted). At this exact
level, memories represent narrow, sensory-perceptual details of experiences that may have lasted
for short periods of time (Conway, 2009). Importantly, these experiences either interest events that
the individual experienced in first hand, such as self-defining memories (i.e., memories of events
that are particularly remarkable and important to define one’s identity), or memories of events that
are yet important for the person, but that she did not necessarily directly experience. This latter is
the case of ‘Flashbulb memories (FBMs), which will be the object of the current dissertation.
FBMs are autobiographical recalls of the circumstances in which an individual learned
about an important, emotional-arousing, and self-relevant event (Brown & Kulik, 1977).In addition
to this information, the recall of items of this type also entails factual details of the event itself, also
known as ‘Event memory (EM)’. The first empirical study upon emotional memories for public
events dates back to 1977, when Roger Brown and James Kulik proposed that, triggered by
consequentiality and surprise, FBMs constituted a special class of autobiographical memories
because of the extraordinary indelibility, vividness, and perceptually that uniquely characterised
their recall. It goes without saying that Brown and Kulik’s seminal theory has attracted the interest
of memory researchers ever since, raising heated debates and thorny controversies that have been
lasting since over four decades. Although research has studied FBM of private events (Kraha &
Boals, 2014; Pillemer, 2009; Tekcan, 2001), the main focus of investigation has been directed to the
recall of negative public ones such as human and natural disasters (e.g., Bohannon, 1988; Er, 2003;
Neisser et al., 1996; Neisser & Harsch, 1992; Otani et al., 2005), terrorist attacks (e.g., Gandolphe
& El Haj, 2016; Hirst et al., 2009, 2015; Kvavilashvili, Mirani, Schlagman, Foley, & Kornbrot,
2009; Luminet et al., 2004; Talarico & Rubin, 2003), the death of important public people (e.g.,
Finkenauer et al., 1998; Hornstein, Brown, & Mulligan, 2003; Tinti, Schmidt, Sotgiu, Testa, &
Curci, 2009), and resignation or death of political leaders (e.g., Brown & Kulik, 1977; Conway et
al., 1994; Curci, Luminet, Finkenauer, & Gisle, 2001; Pillemer, 1984); but also a number of
positive ones such as the acceptance to college (e.g., Liu, Ying, & Luo, 2012; Tekcan, 2001), the
death of threatening terrorists (e.g., Demiray & Freund, 2014; Kraha, Boals, Kraha, & Boals, 2016),
and the victory of important sport games (Kensinger & Schacter, 2006; Talarico & Moore, 2012;
Tinti, Schmidt, Testa, & Levine, 2014). In general, always prioritising events of the real-world,
memory researchers have investigated three main overarching themes of the FBM phenomenon: its
qualitative structure, its phenomenology, and its determinants. The first refers to the contents that
characterize these recalls; the second makes reference to their distinctive features, such as
consistency, vividness, and confidence; and the latter implies the study of the intra- and inter-
individual variables that determine their formation and retrieval. In addition to that, research has
addressed the study of EM to its phenomenology, but most importantly, to its relationship with
FBM.
1.2.1 Flashbulb memory: qualitative structure
The study of FBM has been inaugurated in 1977, when Brown and Kulik proposed an in
depth analysis of the contents that characterize these recalls. The authors conducted a qualitative
study of 80 Americans’ recalls upon different FBM-events (e.g., the death of Martin Luther King
and John F. Kennedy), and identified the presence of six recurrent types of information that they
called ‘canonical categories’. Contents of these categories entailed details about the ‘place’ in
which the person first learned the news, the ‘ongoing activity’ that was interrupted by the news, the
‘informant’ who brought her the news, her ‘own affect’ upon learning the news, as well as ‘others’
affect’, and finally the immediate ‘aftermath’ of learning the news. In addition to this set of
information that was recurrent all over participants’ records, some recalls also contained isolated
perceptual details, as describing a narrow, crystal-clear frame of a photograph. Some examples that
the authors report are: “She said ‘Oh God! I knew they would kill him!’”; “We all had our little blue
uniforms”; “I was carrying a carton of Viceroy cigarettes which I dropped” (Brown & Kulik, 1977,
p. 80). Information of this kind fit none of the above mentioned canonical categories, and were
defined by Brown and Kulik (1977) as ‘idiosyncratic contents’. The presence of these iconic
contents has received poor attention from memory researchers, who have rather focused on
gathering a more accurate description of further context attributes. Thus, after Brown and Kulik
(1977), new categories have been advanced, such as ‘others present’ (Christianson, 1989), ‘first
thoughts’ (Kizilöz & Tekcan, 2013; Larsen, 1992), ‘part of the day in which the news was learned’
(Bohannon, 1988), and ‘atmospheric conditions’ (Berntsen & Thomsen, 2005), while idiosyncratic
details have been measured separately and counted as additional proof of memory specificity
(Finkenauer et al., 1998). Importantly, this multifaceted use of context attributes raises the question
whether it is possible to achieve a univocal definition of the context attributes to be used to detect a
FBM, as well as relevant theoretical questions upon the nature of FBM’s perceptive contents.
1.2.2 Flashbulb memory: phenomenology
A large amount of studies has examined in depth the phenomenology of FBMs, focusing in
particular on their longevity, consistency, vividness, and confidence. Studies investigating the
longevity of these memories have generally adopted single-test methodologies to show how people
can retain autobiographical records of important public events for years, or even decades. For
example, yet Brown and Kulik (1977) were aware of the unusual permanence of these recalls, as
they observed that the majority of respondents was able to report narrow details about events that
they had learned over 30 years before. To explain this ability, they conjectured the existence of a
special brain mechanisms – the ‘Now, print!’ – that would render this FBMs unusually durable,
veridical, and indelible over long time of periods. Most recently, Kvavilashvili et al. (2003) found
that British participants could report vivid memories of learning about the Death of Princess Diana
after a delay of 51 months; and others researchers found that elderly participants could still provide
detailed and specific accounts of the circumstances when learning about important historical events
– e.g. the death of the first president of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, 58 years after the event
(Tekcan & Peynircioğlu, 2002) and the occupation of Denmark from the German troupes 63 years
after the event (Berntsen & Thomsen, 2005).
However, these findings have been resized – and at times questioned – from the numerous
studies which have provided a test of FBM’s evolution over multiple time points. On this matter, it
is important to mention that, because of the methodological issues of measuring accuracy for
autobiographical records, researchers have focused on the study of these memories’ consistency. By
adopting longitudinal designs, studies on FBMs’ consistency found heterogeneous results: some
have shown that FBM records are preserved over time in a detailed and coherent manner (Conway
et al., 1994; Luminet et al., 2004; Tinti et al., 2009) – although not permanent and veridical as
Brown and Kulik first postulated (Kvavilashvili et al., 2009) – while others have instead
demonstrated that they would be mainly subject to inconsistencies (Neisser & Harsch, 1992) and
repetition errors (Hirst et al., 2015). One of the primary researches questioning FBM’s consistency
is the one carried out by Neisser and Harsch (1992) upon the Space Challenger disaster, whose
main claim was that the recall of these memories would be driven by narrative conventions and
arisen through familiar memory consolidation processes such as rehearsal. Another claim comes
from Talarico and Rubin’s work (2003), in which the authors tracked the consistency of FBM of a
public event (i.e., the 9/11 terrorist attack) as well as the autobiographical memory of an everyday
life one (e.g., an episode related to school, a news received from a friend) over three different time
points (i.e., 1, 6, or 32 weeks after the event), showing that the former does not appear to be much
more consistent than the latter. Similarly, in a study involving larger periods of time between the
initial assessment and re-tests (i.e., 15 and 32 months after the event), Schmolck, Buffalo, and
Squire (2000), pointed out that the quality of FBM’s recollection strongly differed from the first to
the second re-test. This finding reflected that, after 15 months, the majority of participants reported
a consistent FBMs, while after 32 months, the majority of them recalled strongly inaccurate ones.
Finally, the most recent and complete study on FBMs is the one conducted by Hirst and colleagues
(2009, 2015) upon the 9/11. In this work, the authors report novel insights upon the development of
FBM’s curve over a 10-year period. More specifically, they show that FBM’s consistency drops
dramatically after the first year, in order to later stabilize within the subsequent follow-ups –
meaning that the inconsistencies developed between the initial assessment and the first re-test were
maintained over time. To a great degree, these empirical findings draw a variegated frame, and
suggest that the way in which FBM evolves over time still remains unclear.
Besides longevity and consistency, research has also headed attention to the degrees of
vividness and confidence by which participants recalled their FBM. Dating back to Brown and
Kulik (1977), vividness has been thought to be one of the central features of FBM, giving it a
special status among other autobiographical recalls. Specifically, the authors argued that FBM was
characterized by an exceptional ‘live quality’, that would render the recall as sharp and lively as a
snapshot of a photography – in their words, “Almost everyone testifies that his recall of his
circumstances in not an inference from a regular routine. It has a primary, ‘live quality’ that is
almost perceptual. Indeed, it is very like a photograph that preserves the scene in which each of us
found himself when the flashbulb was fired” (Brown & Kulik, p. 74). Thus, subsequent research has
often measured the extent to which participants could see a vivid picture of their reception context,
and found extremely high ratings also over long time periods (Kvavilashvili et al., 2009; Talarico &
Moore, 2012; Talarico & Rubin, 2003; Tinti et al., 2009). Nevertheless, only a limited number of
studies have sought to empirically investigate FBM’s perceptual contents. The few exceptions are
given by Finkenauer (1998), Curci (2001), and their respective collaborators who have used a free
recall task in which participants were asked to provide a list of details of the circumstances in which
they learned the news. These details were then scored according to a number of criteria entailing,
for example, mutable aspects of the environment, the respondent’s position in relation to the
environment, and most broadly, any detail that was not simply ‘inferred’ on the basis of their
familiarity with the event, as Brown and Kulik (1977) first suggested. As a matter of fact, these
studies have been limited to the mere assessment of FBM’s perceptive contents as a proxy of
contextual attributes’ specificity, and failed to investigate whether they might actually cover any
functions in the recall of these latter.
Beside vividness, also confidence has been highlighted among FBM’s distinctive features,
with several studies reporting strikingly high rates (e.g., Coluccia, Bianco, & Brandimonte, 2010;
Neisser et al., 1996; Neisser & Harsch, 1992; Paradis, Solomon, Florer, & Thompson, 2004), and
others arguing that it may actually be FBM’s most salient characteristic (Talarico & Rubin, 2003,
2007). Indeed, the most striking aspect related to confidence ratings is that they have been shown to
remain extremely high independently from FBM’s consistency (Neisser et al., 1996; Otani et al.,
2005). For example, Hirst and his collaborators (2015) observed that, while memory consistency
endured the effect of time, confidence had only a slight decrease, even ten years apart. To sum up,
these results consistently suggest that FBM is characterised by vivid recalls which people are
extremely confident about, regardless of their objective consistency.
1.2.3 Flashbulb memory: determinants
The study of the latent variables influencing the formation and maintenance of FBMs –
operationalised according to the consistency or specificity of the reception context’s attributes – has
captured memory researchers’ attention ever since Brown and Kulik (1977) first pointed out their
main determinants as surprise and consequentiality. The authors retained that the emotion of
surprise was an essential antecedent to FBM, as well as consequentiality, which they
operationalised according to the individual’s social group’s bonding – for example, the authors
reported strong differences between White and Black Americans upon the recollection of Martin
Luther King’s assassination. However, since Brown and Kulik (1977) did not test the direct role of
these predictors, the extended body of research that followed sought to provide a test of their
hypotheses, reaching a general consensus upon the centrality of consequentiality and the non-
indispensable role of surprise (Coluccia et al., 2010; Lanciano, Curci, & Soleti, 2013; Tinti et al.,
2009). Furthermore, researchers have looked into other possible determinants, and proposed
different and novel pathways of FBM’s formation with the use of statistical techniques such as
Structural Equation Modelling (SEM).
The first model of FBM’s formation was proposed by Conway and collaborators in 1994. In
a test-retest study, the authors investigated the memories of British and non-British participants
upon the resignation of English prime minister Margaret Thatcher. In this study, Conway et al.
(1994) aimed to assess the role of importance/consequentiality, emotional arousal, prior knowledge,
affective attitude, and rehearsal to explain the formation of FBM and the possible differences
between the two groups. Thus, the authors highlighted the central role of prior knowledge
(operationalised as interest in politics) and affective attitude toward Thatcher and
importance/consequentiality as main factors influencing these memories’ formation, and the role of
overt rehearsal as a factor influencing their retention over time. Additionally, they did not find
surprise and emotional feeling state to play a significant role, albeit it must be noted that the two
were considered as one unit, which precluded any observations upon their respective individual
function.
Another influential model was proposed by Finkenauer and collaborators in 1998. The
authors referred to it as ‘the emotional-integrative model’, since it was conceptualised as an
integration of Conway et al.’s (1994) and Brown and Kulik’s insights (1977). However, the
innovation of this model lies within an accurate distinction of the appraisals – i.e., people’s
cognitive evaluation of an event (Frijda, 1993; Scherer, 1984) – and emotions involved in the
formation of FBM. Thus, the authors disentangled surprise from general emotional feeling state,
and proposed the appraisal of novelty as main determinant of the former, and the appraisal of
importance/consequentiality as predictor of the latter. Despite the fact that Finkenauer et al.’s model
(1998) did not take into account a longitudinal measure of FBM, it is yet considered as a central
contribution to the study of these memories. Following Finkenauer et al. (1998), more recent works
have addressed other aspects of FBM’s remembering. For example, Tinti et al. (2009) conducted a
study on the death of Pope John Paul II, and proposed a model in which the affective attitude
three groups of participants that varied on their attitude toward the Pope, the authors demonstrated
the centrality of this appraisal in the formation of FBMs. Taken together, these models provide
reliable evidence of the variables underpinning the formation of FBMs.
1.2.4 Event memory
The study of an emotional public event does not only target to the autobiographical memory
of the individual’s reception context, but it focuses as well on the facts that have characterised the
event, namely, ‘Event memory (EM)’ (Neisser & Harsch, 1992). EM contains a specific set of
information regarding how the event came to happen – to mention some examples, the number of
airplanes that stroke the Tween Towers during the 9/11 terrorist attack; or the name of the player
who scored the decisive goal during a world cup football final. EM embodies a semantic-like
knowledge of the event (Bohannon & Symons, 1992). In this respect, EM has to do with the
representable knowledge that the person possesses about the world, rather than the autobiographical
remembering of her personal experience of receiving the news. This distinction has raised important
theoretical questions about whether FBM and EM may rely on different memory systems (Tinti et
al., 2014). Indeed, a first peculiarity of EMs is that their contents can be assessed according to their
accuracy. This is because, contrary to the FBM’s recall which varies among each individual, EM
should be the same for everybody, granting an objective test of its veracity. Despite this, empirical
research investigating the relationship between the two has adopted different methodologies and
provided contrasting results. In some studies, event memory was not assessed (e.g., Brown & Kulik,
1977), in others, the recall of FBM coincided with the one of EM, as participants were directly
involved in the event – for example, Er (2003) assessed FBM and EM among Turkish people who
had been victims of the Marmara earthquake – and in still others, the questions used to assess EMs
and FBMs overlapped (e.g., Tinti et al., 2009). Nevertheless, the empirical research investigating
the two has shown that EM exhibits a different evolution over time compared to FBM. For
example, Curci et al. (2001) found that EM of French president Mitterrand’s death did not decrease
over time, while FBM was impaired; and Hirst et al. (2009, 2015), in their study on the 9/11
terrorist attacks, found two different patterns of memory forgetting: while errors pertaining to FBM
attributes were more likely to be repeated, EM’s inaccuracies were more likely to be corrected.
Also, some studies pointed out that participants’ degree of involvement in the event has different
effects on EM and FBM (Tekcan, Ece, Gülgöz, & Er, 2003): Pezdek (2003) found EMs of 9/11 to
be more accurate in a sample of New Yorkers and less accurate in a sample of Californian and
Hawaiian participants, while the pattern was opposite for FBMs’ recall – measured in terms of its
richness (Pezdek, 2003). Concerning to the theoretical models proposed to explain the formation of
EM, there is agreement upon ‘prior knowledge’ as its main antecedent (Conway et al., 1994; Tinti
et al., 2014). However, its relationship with FBM still remains controverted. Some models
(Finkenauer et al., 1998; Tinti et al., 2009) have shown that, when mediated by rehearsal, EM could
determine the recall of FBM. Others (Tinti et al., 2014) have instead proposed a distinction of
media- and individual- rehearsal to provide evidence of two different pathways that respectively
lead to the formation of EM and FBM. Still others, have argued that FBM and EM would be
encoded and processed from different processes (Pezdek, 2003). Notably, in these studies, FBM and
EM were measured along single assessments, preventing any generalisations upon their accuracy
and consistency over time. Thus, the questions whether EM may determine FBM, and whether the
two have different predictors and phenomenological features over time, still remain unanswered.
1.3 Overview of the present dissertation
The study of FBMs has captured the attention of memory researchers ever since Brown and
Kulik (1977) conducted the first empirical study on the topic. Over the past four decades, the
flourishing interest in FBMs (and later, on EMs) has driven researchers to take the most influential
public events of our time as targets to explore the phenomenon. Consequentially, the description of
FBMs has undergone an important transformation, which has reflected in a strong debate about
their existence. What best characterizes the heart of these memories? What may make them unique
in respect to any other autobiographical memory of mundane events? And what is their relationship
with EMs? The goal of this dissertation is to address these questions, and to further elucidate the
nature of FBMs and EMs, both in terms of the mechanisms underlying their formation, and the
phenomenology that characterizes – and potentially distinguishes – their recall. Hence, we will
gradually explore different aspects of FBMs such as autonoetic consciousness, vividness,
confidence, ‘live quality’, emotion, importance, and rehearsal, and finally compare them with EMs.
In Chapter 2, we review literature on FBMs to gain a better understanding of these
memories’ phenomenology. In particular, we first outline the methodologies that previous studies
have adopted to study FBMs; then we address the different ways in which the contents of these
memories have been operationalized; and finally, we review results of previous research to draft a
frame of their phenomenology (i.e., consistency, vividness, and confidence/accuracy). Building on
these results, we present two empirical chapters in which we aim to examine in depth these three
phenomenological aspects.
The empirical studies presented in this dissertation have a common methodology: they entail
test-retest studies, where we assessed participants’ memories within a few days after the event, and
again after one or more re-test(s); they target to real-life public events; and they assess FBMs’ and
EMs’ contents and determinants throughout a survey that we adapted from existing ones.
In Chapter 3, we find our rationale back to Brown and Kulik seminal work to advance a new
theoretical model by which we introduce a novel component that takes into account FBMs’ live
quality, and that may further explain their formation. We labelled the elements pertaining to this
component ‘perceptive core images’, and we postulate that they are unique to FBMs because of
their vividness, consistency, and perceptual feature. This Chapter is composed by two studies: the
first targets to the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI (first assessment, T1, in February 2013, and
second assessment, T2, in August 2013) and the second to the terrorist attacks occurred in Paris in
November 2015 (T1 in 11/2015, and T2 in 7/2016).
In Chapter 4, we aim to gather a deeper investigation of FBMs’ and EMs’ phenomenology.
To assess whether the two may belong to different memory systems, we first observe how they
evolve over long periods of time. Then, we assess whether their recall is predicted by different
encoding variables. To do so, we investigate (Study 3) British and Italian people’s memories about
the EU referendum on UK membership and track their consistency, vividness, confidence, and
recollective experience – this last, throughout the ‘Remember’, ‘Know’, ‘Familiar’, ‘Guess’
paradigm – across three time points (T1, June 2016; T2, May 2017, T3, April 2018). Moreover, we
provide a distinction between FBMs’ and EMs’ respective predictors. Finally, in Chapter 5, we
draw the conclusions and the future directions that the present dissertation has tickled.
Each empirical chapter represents an independent research article. All the work presented in
this dissertation has been carried out under the supervision of Dr. Susanna Schmidt and Prof. Carla
Tinti. In addition, Prof. Martin A. Conway has provided important theoretical feedbacks on an
earlier draft of the work presented in Chapter 2, and Dr. Silvia Testa has collaborated to the
statistical analyses of Studies 1 and 2. Finally, Study 3 (Chapter 4) has been conducted at City,
University of London during a research visit under the supervision of Prof. Martin A. Conway.
Importantly, as this dissertation is the product of the time, energies, and intellectual knowledge
these people have invested in my Ph.D. project, I have chosen to use the pronoun ‘we’ throughout
it, rather than ‘I’.

CHAPTER 2. Accuracy, vividness, and confidence: a systematic review on the
phenomenology of flashbulb memory
2.1 Abstract
For more than 40 years, memory researchers have been debating about the nature of
flashbulb memories (FBMs) – autobiographical memories of the reception context of emotional
public events. We reviewed literature on the topic to determine how FBM have been
operationalised and how their phenomenology (accuracy, vividness, and confidence) has been
observed over time. Results of 37 longitudinal studies showed that FBMs have been typically
investigated among negative events (83%), with retention intervals ranging from 1 week to 10
years, and that their contents have been subsumed under four context attributes – the ‘where’,
‘what’, ‘who’, and ‘with whom’ – measured in term of consistency. We also found FBMs to be
highly vivid, accompanied by even higher rates of confidence, and moderately consistent over time.
Most importantly, we observed that FBMs literature is characterised by a marked heterogeneity in
the methods and measures. Thus, we sought to provide narrow recommendations for more
standardised practices in future research.
Keywords: autobiographical memory, memory accuracy, memory consistency, public event
2.2 Introduction
At the end of the XIX century, headed by the interest to grasp ‘the abiding character of a
vivid experience’ (Colegrove, 1899, p. 247), psychologist Colegrove conducted a pioneering study
on human memory. In doing so, he asked 179 Americans to recall where they were when learning
about the assassination of President Lincoln, and found that a high proportion of them (71%) could
still retain vivid and specific memories of the personal context in which they learned the news over
30 years before. Perhaps unconsciously, Colegrove paved the ground for a topic that yet today
fascinates and puzzles memory researchers and the public: autobiographical remembering of
emotional events. The study of these memories remained unexplored until 1977, when Brown and
Kulik first coined the term ‘Flashbulb memory (FBM)’ to define the memory of the moment in
which an individual first learns about the news of an event that is surprising, emotional,
consequential, and highly self-relevant. The authors treasured the distinctive features of vividness
and longevity proposed by Colegrove, and conjectured that these memories were somewhat more
‘special’ than any other autobiographical ones, as they were encoded in a privileged way by a brain
mechanism that rendered them unusually durable and detailed over long periods of time.
Over the forty years that followed Brown and Kulik’s seminal work, the study of FBMs
gained a research area on its own, with public events of the real world as its main protagonists.
Thus, the main influential events of our contemporary centuries have characterised the target of
FBMs’ investigation: from the assassination of influential public figures, e.g., Swedish Prime
Minister Olof Palme (Christianson, 1989), Israel’s Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin (Nachson &
Zelig, 2003); and death of famous ones, e.g., Princess Diana (Hornstein et al., 2003), Pope John
Paul II (Tinti et al., 2009) Popstar Michael Jackson (Day & Ross, 2014); to natural disasters, e.g.,
the earthquake in Loma Prieta (Neisser et al., 1996), and in Turkish region Marmara (Er, 2003);
until the most tragic terrorist attacks such as the one of the World Trade Centre (Conway, Skitka,
Hemmerich, & Kershaw, 2009; Curci & Luminet, 2006; Rimmele, Davachi, & Phelps, 2012;
Schaefer, Halldorson, & Dizon-Reynante, 2011; Schmidt, 2004; Smith, Bibi, & Sheard, 2003;
Talarico & Rubin, 2003). Most importantly, this huge body of research has questioned Brown and
Kulik’s original hypothesis, raising a heated and yet long-lasting debate about the nature of FBMs.
As a consequence of that, the object of the present review will cover two broad issues that still
strive to find a consensus among FBMs’ researchers: the operalisation of the construct (i.e., a
univocal definition of FBM’s contents and measurement), and its phenomenology (i.e., accuracy,
vividness, and confidence).
2.2.1 Operationalisation of flashbulb memory
In the first empirical attempt to investigate the contents of FBMs, Brown and Kulik (1977)
surveyed 80 Americans upon ten representative public events of their time, and found a recurrent
information that they subsumed under six canonical categories of recall: location, activity,
informant, aftermath, own affect, and others’ affect. According to the authors, the mere presence of
one of the above mentioned canonical categories was sufficient to determine the presence of a
FBM. However, some research retained that these elements were unsatisfactory to describe the
contents of FBMs, and that the criteria they proposed to determine the presence of the construct was
too broad (Curci, 2018; Schmolck et al., 2000). Thus, some researchers defined other contents of
the reception context, such as ‘other people present’ (Christianson, 1989), ‘first thoughts’ (Kizilöz
& Tekcan, 2013), ‘part of the day in which the news was learned’ (Bohannon, 1988) and
‘atmospheric conditions’ (Berntsen & Thomsen, 2005). Others, instead, developed more refined
techniques: some studies have reported the amount of context details that participants could report
at one time point, in terms of the richness of the recall (Finkenauer et al., 1998; Tinti et al., 2014),
while others have sought to measure their accuracy over time (Neisser et al., 1996). However, as it
is not always feasible to measure accuracy for autobiographical recalls, research has been typically
focusing on the consistency of memory recalls (Talarico & Rubin, 2003). Thus, different scoring
procedures have been adopted to compare recalls at re-test with initial assessment in order to gather
a continuous measure of consistency (Pillemer, 1984). In this respect, researchers have attempted to
reduce possible ceiling effects of consistency’s measurement by awarding different weights to the
different context attributes. For example, Neisser and Harsch (1992) developed a procedure called
WAS (Weighted Attributes Scores), in which they proposed to sum up the consistency scores of the
so called ‘major attributes’ (i.e., location, informant, and ongoing activity) and then to count an
additional bonus point whenever the participant could consistently recall at least one of the ‘minor
attributes’ as well (i.e., other people present and the time of the day when the news was learned).
Finally, another insight comes from Conway et al.’s work on Margaret Thatcher’s resignation
(1994), in which the authors proposed a cut-off to determine the presence of FBM, i.e., the
consistent recall of at least 90% of the context attributes under investigation (e.g., location, activity,
informant, others present, and free recall).
However, despite these procedures have been largely adopted to gain a measure of FBMs’
consistency and presence, an a-priori issue has not been considered yet: among the many proposed
ones, what context attributes should be used to measure FBMs? Answering to this question is
pivotal, since such a heterogeneous approach on the measurement of FBM may have led to
heterogeneous results, and finally to conflicting conclusions upon the nature of these memories.
2.2.1 Phenomenology of flashbulb memory
FBM’s literature has been characterised by strong opponent views on the defining features
of FBMs. On the one hand, some studies in support of their special status have shown that FBMs
are highly vivid, detailed, and durable over time. The latter, in particular, was proposed by Brown
and Kulik (1977) as a defining characteristic. However, since the authors did not provide a test of
consistency, further studies have elaborated these claims by using test-rest methodologies. Thus,
many of them could show that FBMs actually carry perceptive and vivid features (Kvavilashvili et
al., 2009), and provided additional evidence upon the consistent recall of these memories (Conway
et al., 1994; Curci & Luminet, 2006; Paradis, Solomon, Florer, & Thompson, 2004; Shapiro, 2006;
Tekcan, Ece, Gülgöz, & Er, 2003; Tinti et al., 2009) – though yet not as permanent as Brown and
Kulik originally claimed (Kvavilashvili et al., 2009). Nevertheless, an extensive amount of
researches has instead claimed that what may make FBMs ‘special’ is people’s confidence upon
their recalls rather than their consistency, as just like ordinary memories of mundane events, FBMs
would be subject to forgetting, distortions, and repetition errors (Hirst et al., 2009, 2015; Neisser &
Harsch, 1992; Schmolck et al., 2000; Talarico & Rubin, 2003). Lying on opposite sides of the same
continuum, the controverted arguments offered by the ‘special’ party and its respective opponents
may have led to questionable generalizations upon the FBM’s phenomenon.
To address this issue, we review literature on FBMs to gain a better understanding on the
nature and prevalence of these memories. To do so, we first aim to:
(1) analyse the most common approaches on the study of FBM.
Then, we aim to address three specific questions that reflect the current debate:
(1) What FBM’s contents have been investigated, and how have they been measured?
(2) What level of consistency do FBMs show over time?
(3) What levels of vividness and confidence characterise the phenomenology of FBMs?
2.3 Methods
2.3.1 Search strategy and inclusion criteria
An initial data set of 1,712 articles was identified in May 2018 by submitting a search query
to Scopus, PubMed, and ProQuest. The query searched keywords in the ‘title’, ‘abstract’, and
‘keyword heading’ fields. The following keywords were used in separate and combined searches:
autobiographical memory, flashbulb memory, event memory, public event, collective memory,
memory consistency, memory accuracy, memory phenomenology.
After duplicates were removed, a set of 1,253 articles was screened for the following
inclusion criteria: (1) studies must focus on normal populations; (2) studies must focus on FBM of
public events, (3) studies must carry a within-subject design for longitudinal assessment of FBM. A
total of 1,136 articles were excluded after inspection of their abstract, and full-text assessment for
eligibility was conducted for 117 studies. This screening process resulted in the selection of 39
articles for inclusion in our analysis. Two studies were excluded from analyses as they assessed
different research questions using the same sample. This resulted in a final set of 37 articles. The

FBM’s contents. FBM’s contents under investigation varied across studies. The
FBM contents’ unit of measurement. Scores awarded to each content resulted in three units
of measurement:
(1) Unit of measurement 1: Combined consistency score, indicating that the consistency
scores awarded to each content were summed up into a composite index. Since the
resulting scales could have different ranges according to the number of contents
under investigation, studies that adopted this unit of measurement were further
(2) Unit of measurement 2: Weighted Attribute Score, indicating that contents were
scored according to Neisser and Harsch’s procedure (1992), and summed up into an
index that could range from 0 to 7.
(3) Unit of measurement 3: Consistency score for each category, indicating that
consistency scores have been computed for each content and reported individually.
FBM’s level of consistency or incidence. Different strategies were used to determine the
results are reported along three categories:
(1) Measurement of consistency through a mean score: in this category we report the
means (and standard deviations or standard errors, when available) of FBM
consistency scores.
(2) Measurement of consistency through Conway et al.’s cut-off (1994): Some studies
did not report a mean of FBM consistency score. Thus, the reported percentages
express the proportion of participants who could consistently recall at least 90% of
the contents. Unit of measurement and the scale that was adopted to score the
contents are reported.
(3) Measurement of consistency through other methods: Finally, other studies did report
neither a mean of FBM consistency score, nor a percentage of FBM incidence
according to Conway’s method. Rather, results were expressed along the following
three sub-categories:
i. Combined accuracy percent, i.e., a percentage of consistency expressed
as: 100* (place + activity + others) / 6;
ii. Percentage of consistency scores for FBM attributes;
iii. Percentage of participants who recalled consistently.
Overall FBM consistency. In order to gather a homogeneous measure of FBM’s
consistency, we fit the reported values and percentages along three post-hoc categories, respectively
indicating low, medium, and high consistency. The thresholds that we established to create the
Means of vividness and confidence ratings. Mean values of vividness and confidence were
to assess the overall level of vividness and confidence. The detail of the thresholds that we

Since no differences were found in FBM recalls among different subsamples, results are reported for the whole sample.
Results pertaining to the two events investigated in the same study will be reported as two independent samples.
As we can observe, the vast majority of target events carried a negative valence (n =33),
with some studies investigating positive ones (Koppel et al., 2013; Kraha, Talarico, & Boals, 2014),
and others focusing on events that could have been appraised either as negative or positive, e.g., the
resignation of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (Conway et al., 1994), O.J. Simpson
acquittal (Schmolck et al., 2000; Winningham, Hyman, & Dinnel, 2000), and ‘The Rivalry’ football
game (Talarico & Moore, 2012). The nature of the event under investigation varied across studies:
11 studies focused on the death, assassination, or resignation of important public figures; 7 studies
focused on natural or human disasters; 17 studies targeted to the 9/11 terroristic attack; and 5
studies on other events (e.g., sport related events, jury trials). Moreover, 20 studies used students’
population.
Seven studies investigated FBMs of the same event across different groups: Conway et al.
(1994) compared FBMs of Thatcher resignation between two groups with a different affective
attitude (i.e., British and non-British participants); Neisser et al. (1996) and Er (2003) respectively
compared different groups according to the proximity to the event and participant’s personal
involvement; Curci et al. (2001) assessed FBMs of French President Mitterrand across French and
Belgian people to study the effect of participants’ social bonding; Tinti et al. (2009) compared
FBMs of Pope John Paul II’s death across Catholics with different proximity to the Pope; Talarico
and Moore (2012) compared memories of an important football game across the two opponent
teams; and Curci and her collaborators (2015) assessed FBMs of Pope Benedict XVI resignation
among three religious groups (Church- and non-churchgoers Catholics and Evangelists).
Other researchers, instead, assessed FBMs’ consistency according to the onset of the first
assessments. For example, Winningham et al. (2000), as well as Lee and Brown (2003) and Shapiro
(2006) manipulated the assessment of the first test (immediate vs delayed) with the aim of testing a
‘consolidation hypothesis’, according to which a FBM’s narrative would be constructed in the days
immediately after the event and maintained regardless of its inconsistencies and errors. Other
studies used a between-subject design to compare participants’ recalls across different time delays;
for instance, Talarico and Rubin (2003) and Kraha et al. (2014) surveyed all participants right after
the event and then created different groups that completed the re-test across different time lapses.
Overall, the majority of the studies (n = 26) assessed FBMs across one re-test.
Sample sizes varied across studies, ranging from 18 to 985 participants, M = 164.85, SD =
205.24. We computed descriptive statistics for 13 studies that used 2 or more conditions, and found
that sub-sample sizes ranged from 13 participants per condition to 235 (M = 70.17, SD = 68.44).
Finally, the time period between the initial event and the first FBM’s assessment varied from 0
days to 9 months. The interval between the event and the follow-up ranged from one week to 10
years.
2.4.2 What FBM’s contents have been investigated, and how have they been measured?
are ordered as follow: FBMs’ level of consistency or incidence; FBMs’ unit of measurement; the
adopted scale or scoring strategy; year of publication2.

Note. 0 – 1; 0 – 2; First contents are scored as 0 – 2, then they are transformed in a percentage; Location’, ‘Informant’, ‘activity’ are scored 0 – 2, and an
additional point is scored whenever participants can consistently recall either ‘other people present’ or ‘time at which the news was learned’.
An overall mean value was calculated by the first author of this review.
Values are approximate and standard deviations are not reported since they are inferred from tables or figures.
The authors also assessed Time, Last person you talked with, day, week, clothes, first thoughts and found an incidence of FBM among 14% of participants.
However, for the sake of consistency, we only reported the attributes according to Conway’s method.
Brown and Kulik’s canonical categories: L = Location, A = Activity, I = Informant, IA = Immediate Aftermath, OA = Own Affect, AO = Affect in Others.
Other contents: OP = Others Present, T = Time of the day when the news was learned, FR = Free recall, DR = Details’ free Recall, W = Weather, AB = Activity
immediately Before, C = Clothes, D = Day, DW = Day of the Week, H = Hour, ED = what you were Eating or Drinking, FP = First Person you communicated
with, FT = First Thought, HL = How the news was Learned, OIA = Others’ Immediate Aftermath, S = Source of news.
FBM’s contents. Location and ongoing activity when learning the news were assessed among
all the reviewed studies3. 28 studies assessed the category ‘informant’4, 8 assessed the ‘immediate
aftermath’, 5 assessed the ‘own affect’, and 5 assessed the ‘others’ affect’. With respect to the
attributes that do not belong to Brown and Kulik’s canonical categories, 29 studies investigated
‘others present’, and 24 investigated the ‘time when the news was learned’. Other attributes were
assessed less frequently, and in most cases considered as ‘peripheral details’ (Ferré Romeu, 2006).
Scoring procedures. Among all reviewed studies, two different scoring strategies were
adopted to gather a measure of consistency of FBM’s contents over time: scores assigned to each
content either ranged from 0 to 1, or from 0 to 2. A caveat of this procedure was used in some
studies (Christianson, 1989; Christianson & Engelberg, 1999), where the authors used a strict and a
lenient criterion: in the first, attributes were scored as highly consistent when the information
provided in the follow-up test included exactly the same specific, detailed information (though not
necessarily in the same wording) that was reported in the initial assessment test; while in the last,
responses were scored as highly consistent when they included the core information, but not
necessarily the specific details.
Unit of measurement. The way in which consistency scores were collapsed resulted in three
different units of measurement: 21 studies summed up the scores assigned to each content into a combined
consistency score (Unit of measurement 1); 4 studies summed up the scores into a composite index by
considering each content’s weight (Unit of measurement 2); and 12 studies reported results pertaining to
each category separately (Unit of measurement 3).
We did not consider Talarico & Moore’s study (2012) as the authors surveyed people who followed the
Lafayette-Lehigh, and therefore did not need to assess ‘ongoing activity’.
Curci et al. (2001) assessed ‘informant’ but did not consider this content because of a ceiling effect in
statistical analyses.
2.4.3 What level of consistency do FBMs show over time?
Overall, we classified a total of 70 results reflecting as much as many conditions (Low
consistency, n = 8; Medium consistency, n = 33; High consistency, n = 29). However, to make the
comparison as much homogeneous as possible, we will outline ‘overall FBM consistency’
according to the three methods we observed. 22 studies reported consistency through a mean score,
allowing us to gather a measure of ‘overall FBM consistency’ for a total of 43 mean scores. Among
those, one study reported a result that fit under the ‘low consistency’ category, while 25 scores fit
under the ‘medium consistency’ category, and 17 under the ‘high consistency’ one. 9 studies
reported the incidence of FBM according to Conway’s method. Thus, we gathered 15 results
expressed in percentages, of which 7 fit under ‘low consistency’, 3 fit under ‘medium consistency’,
and 5 under ‘high consistency’. 6 studies adopted other methods to report the incidence of FBM or
its level of consistency, allowing us to observe 12 different scores expressed in percentages
(Medium consistency, n = 5; High consistency, n = 7). Finally, we observed a high rating of both
‘high’ (50%) and ‘medium consistency’ scores (50%) within studies using a retention time of up to
8 months. In comparison, within studies using larger retention times, there was a prevalence of
‘medium consistency’ scores (50%), rather than ‘high’ ones (28.6%), and the presence of ‘low’
scores (21.4%) which was not observed before.
2.4.4 What levels of vividness and confidence characterise the phenomenology of FBM?

investigate none of the two attributes were not included.

Vividness. Vividness was assessed across 10 studies. Besides Pillemer (1984) and
Wolters & Goudsmit (2005) who used respectively an open-ended and a dichotomous
question, the majority of the studies assessed vividness using scales that either ranged from 1
to 5 (n = 1), 1 to 7 (n = 5), 1 to 10 (n = 1), or 0 to 10 (n = 1). Overall, vividness was assessed
by asking participants to visualise an image of the reception context (Kvavilashvili et al.,
2009; Tinti et al., 2009), to think about any perceptual details of that scene (Ferré Romeu,
2006), or across the degree in which participants could see and hear that moment in their
mind (Talarico & Rubin, 2003). All vividness ratings at initial assessment fell under the
category ‘high vividness’, except from two conditions, i.e., Tinti et al. (2009) among the
control group, and Kraha et al. (2014). However, vividness was mostly assessed at re-test: 9
observations fit under the category ‘medium vividness’, and 9 under the category ‘high
vividness’. None of the reviewed study found low levels of vividness.
Confidence. 25 studies assessed the degree in which participants were confident
about their recalls. Scales either ranged from 1 to 3 (n = 4 studies), 1 to 5 (n = 9), 1 to 7 (n =
8), 1 to 9 (n = 2), or 1 to 10 (n = 1). Confidence ratings at the initial assessment fell under the
category ‘high confidence’ in 8 cases, while one case fell under the ‘medium confidence’ one.
The vast majority of studies assessed vividness at re-test, and results indicate that 44
observations fit under the category ‘high confidence’ (with the vast majority of studies
reporting a ‘ceiling effect’), 8 under ‘medium confidence’, and one under ‘low confidence’.
2.5 Discussion
Literature on FBMs is heavily dominated by heterogeneous results and conflicting
statements upon the nature of these recalls. On the one hand, a major tradition of researchers
attributed FBMs a ‘special status’ in virtue of their unusual vividness and durability over long
time periods. On the one other hand, a large amount of studies has shown that people would
be actually inconsistent in their recalls, though yet extremely confident about their veracity.
The main aim of our review was to address these divergent claims to gather a deeper
understanding of the FBM phenomenon. To do so, we examined how previous research has
approached the study of FBMs. In particular, we sought to gather a picture of how FBMs’
contents have been measured, and what might characterise their phenomenology in terms of
consistency, vividness, and confidence. To explore these arguments, we reviewed 37 studies
that focused on public events by adopting a test-retest methodology among non-clinical
populations. Findings are discussed in terms of how they relate to each research question.
(1) What are the most common approaches to the study of FBM?
Our review showed that test-retest studies investigating FBMs of public news have
been mostly carried out across negative events, most of which related to the death of
important public figures, terrorist attacks, or natural disasters. Overall, we found a
homogeneous picture of the adopted methodologies: 16 studies used a cross-sectional design,
24 studies assessed FBMs within less than 15 days after the event, and 24 studies assessed the
re-test at least 9 months after the event. Nevertheless, we observed a diverse picture with
regard to the adopted samples: not only a large amount of studies used relatively small sized
ones, but also some of them did not gather adequate and representative populations for the
target event under investigation. Some studies have indeed sampled undergraduate students
to assess FBMs of events whose emotional arousal was questionable. To mention some:
Neisser and Harsch (1992) on the Challenger explosion; Winningham et al. (2000) and
Schmolck et al. (2000) on O.J. Simpson trial; and Otani et al. (2005) on a nuclear accident in
Japan. Are these events relevant and emotionally arousing for prototypical students? This
point is very well illustrated by Justice, Akhtar, and Conway (2018) who make a distinction
between media events and FBM events: while the latter are unique for their emotional
valence, self-relevance, and consequentiality, the former attract media coverage and
rehearsal, but yet do not always form FBMs, as they may not carry a strong emotional
valence. Thus, as not all public events are self-relevant and consequential for students’
cultural background and concerns, we underline the urge to consider adequate populations for
the event under investigation, and to further assess participants’ emotions and appraisals
toward the event (e.g, see Coluccia et al., 2010). Hence, we believe that the choice of the
target event and the population under investigation is a fundamental aspect to take into
account before conducting research on FBMs, as it could lead to misleading conclusions
about the nature of these memories.
(2) What contents characterise FBM, and how have they been measured?
The assessment of the construct still represents an important and unsolved issue in the
study of FBMs (Curci, 2018). In their original work, Brown and Kulik (1977) proposed six
canonical categories to describe the contents of these recalls (i.e., informant, location,
activity, aftermath, own affect, others’ affect). Nevertheless, these attributes have been
expanded and used in discretionary ways, making it difficult to generalise what contents
should be used to detect a FBM. Results of our review reflect this issue, as there was a
marked heterogeneity in the use of these contents: some authors used Brown and Kulik’s
(1977) canonical categories, and others adopted new ones (e.g., others present, time of
learning the news, atmospheric conditions). Despite this, we could still observe a set of
contents that were used across the majority of the studies: ‘location’, ‘ongoing activity’,
‘informant’, and ‘others present’. These contents have been typically measured according to
their consistency (Talarico & Rubin, 2003). Results of our review revealed a great use of
two- and three-points scales to score each content’s consistency between initial assessment
and the retest(s), as it is not always possible to assess accuracy for autobiographical events
(Talarico & Rubin, 2003). However, the way in which these scores were used to gather a
measure of FBMs’ consistency varied across studies. In fact, the vast majority of studies
combined them into a continuous measure of FBM consistency – either by attributing the
same weight to each contents (Pillemer, 1984), or different ones according to the importance
of the content in question (Neisser & Harsch, 1992) – while other studies reported the level of
consistency for each content at an individual level (Er, 2003).
(3) What level of consistency do FBMs show over time?
The question whether FBMs are consistent over time or subject to autobiographical
memories of mundane events’ reconstructive bias still represents a core issue of the FBMs
debate. Conclusions of the studies we reviewed were drawn along three ways: either from the
observed means of FBM’s consistency scores; by gathering a percentage of participants that
could consistently recall at least 90% of the contents under investigation; or by using other
methods (e.g., percentage of participants who could recall consistently all contents –
previously scored on a dichotomous scale). To gather a more homogeneous state of play, we
sought to frame the reviewed results into three post-hoc categories indicating low, medium,
and high consistency. Overall, results indicate that the majority of results fell under the
‘medium’ and ‘high consistency’ categories, with a few studies reporting ‘low consistency’.
Moreover, retention interval appeared to be an important factor determining FBM’s
consistency. We observed that studies using a 9-months interval or less showed ‘high’ and
‘medium’ consistency; compared to those using larger delays, in which consistency was
generally ‘medium’ and ‘low’.
(4) What levels of vividness and confidence characterise the phenomenology of
FBMs?
Another important issue of the FBMs debate is whether vividness (Brown & Kulik,
1977) and confidence (Talarico & Rubin, 2003) are FBMs’ defining characteristics. Results
of our review are consistent with this claim: almost the totality of the studies assessing
vividness and confidence showed extremely high ratings on both measures, with the majority
of them showing that the two remain stable over long periods of time. Although these results
indicate a consistent picture, it must be noted that we nevertheless found poor homogeneity
on how vividness and confidence were measured. More in detail, only 10 studies measured
‘vividness’, and 25 measured ‘confidence’. Across the majority of the studies, vividness was
assessed both at initial and re-test phase. Confidence, instead, was mostly assessed at re-test,
among scales that ranged from 3- to 11-points ones. In general, we strongly recommend
future researchers to assess vividness and confidence at both tests and along a continuum, in
order to gather a test of their stability over time.
2.4.1 Recommendations for future research
The present review highlighted the need for more rigorous research in the field of
FBM. Although we could outline a picture of these memories’ phenomenology – which
suggests that their recall is moderately consistent over time, highly vivid, and accompanied
by even higher levels of confidence – there was a strong variation in the methods used to
measure the construct. As such heterogeneity has led to conflicting results about the
phenomenology of FBMs, we strongly recommend a more widespread use of standard
procedures and methods to investigate this phenomenon. In particular, we first highlight the
need of highly powered studies with increased sample sizes. Besides, future researchers
should carefully consider the nature of the event under investigation consistently with
participants’ cultural and social background, concerns, and appraisals. In order to alleviate
bias due to the nature of the event and its relative sampling, we suggest the use of control
events that are potentially comparable with the event under focus. This means, using a media
event that is comparable to the FBM-one rather than a private one. Second, we recommend
the use of more standardised procedures for initial assessments and re-tests. Although
gathering participants in the aftermath of an unexpected and emotionally arousing public
event is extremely challenging, we suggest to conduct a first assessment within less than 15
days after the event, in order to avoid memory consolidation and wrong time slice effects due
to time and media effects (Kvavilashvili et al., 2009); next, for what concerns the re-test
phase, we suggest to use large time-lapses between one test and another: for example, our
results showed a high frequency of 9 months-retention times, which nevertheless also
emerged as a factor determining FBM’s consistency. Third, we recommend a more uniform
investigation of FBMs’ contents. Following the present review’s findings, the use of four
attributes is strongly advocated: location, informant, ongoing activity, and others present. A
more uniform use of these four contents may help to achieve higher consistency and
replicability among future researches. Moreover, future studies should aim to a greater
uniformity in the measurement of these attributes over time. For example, the use of a three
points scale to score FBM’s consistency along a continuum is preferred (Curci & Luminet,
2006), as well as reporting a mean consistency score, and the percentage of participants who
could recall consistently at least 90% of the attributes (Conway et al., 1994). Fourth, and
lastly, we strongly recommend future researchers to investigate vividness and confidence
both at initial assessment and at re-test, as these two appear to be the most representative
characteristics of FBMs’ recall.
2.6 Conclusion
The studies included in this review revealed a likely marked heterogeneity among the
operalisation of FBMs. However, we could depict a picture of the phenomenology of the
construct: FBMs are moderately consistent over time, characterised by high vividness, and
exceptional levels of confidence. Finally, due to the theoretical implications associated with
the lack of consistency of the methods, we advocate the need of more standardised
procedures to be conducted in future researches.
CHAPTER 3. The ‘flash’ in flashbulb memory: the construction of long-term memories
through mental images
3.1 Abstract
Flashbulb memories (FBMs) have been described as ‘special’ autobiographical
memories of the circumstances when learning about emotionally arousing public events.
Nevertheless, lack of consistency has boosted a heated debate about their existence, making
them somewhat ‘less special’. The present work assessed this issue making the assumption
that there is a mental image containing perceptual elements that we hypothesize to remain
consistent over time and vivid at recall. We defined these elements ‘perceptive core images’,
and we propose that they are the component making FBMs iconic. Moreover, we argue that
they might be responsible for the recall of the elements that are typically associated to FBMs
(i.e., canonical categories). In two test-retest studies (N=204; N=151) involving large time
delays (respectively 6 and 18 months), we investigated FBMs of two real-life events (i.e., the
resignation of Pope Benedict XVI and the terrorist attacks of November 2015 in Paris), and
developed a procedure to assess perceptive core images. Results of qualitative contents’
analyses showed that 68% and 73% of participants respectively retained a core image.
Regardless of the nature of the event, the proposed structural equation models showed that
perceptive core images are determined by both surprise (Study 1) and strong emotions (Study
2), and that these latter were triggered by importance-consequentiality and novelty,
respectively. Finally, perceptive core images directly determined canonical categories’ recall.
We conclude that perceptive core images should be included in the definition and assessment
of FBMs since they could characterize their nature and explain their recall. Theoretical
implications of this framework are discussed.

3.2 Introduction
People receive news of relevant public events every day, and their daily activities are
coloured by information of different levels of importance and arousal. Through mediums
such as interpersonal communications, traditional printed materials, radio, TV, and more
recently the emergence of the Internet and its accompanying social media outlets, vast
sources of information regarding events occurring throughout the world are accessible and
disseminated at incredible rates (Statista, 2017). However, only a fraction of the news people
receive generates memories for which, beside the facts of the event (i.e., the memory of the
event), people are able to retain a detailed and long lasting recall about the personal
experience of the moment in which they received the news. From a phenomenological point
of view, these memories are highly emotional and often accompanied by vivid sensory
details. For example, most people of appropriate age might still have stored in mind an
exceptionally vivid and perceptual image of some contextual details of when they first
learned about the Challenger disaster, the death of Princess Diana, or the 9/11 terrorist
attacks. Given these unique features, the question arises as to whether these memories are
more special than ordinary memories of everyday life events.
This question has captured the attention of memory researchers and the public ever
since Brown and Kulik (1977) inaugurated the study of what they termed ‘flashbulb
memories’ (FBMs). The authors proposed the existence of a special class of autobiographical
memories that emerges when individuals learn about the news of surprising, consequential,
and emotionally arousing public events. They argued that people could retain in memory a
long-lasting record of that moment, the contents of which could be resumed under six
‘canonical categories’ of recall: place, ongoing activity, informant, others present, own affect,
and aftermath. In addition to these elements, Brown and Kulik found that people could
provide a number of information that the authors themselves were not able to fit under any of
the proposed canonical categories (i.e. “We all had on our little blue uniforms”, Brown &
Kulik, 1977, p. 80), and which they labelled ‘idiosyncratic details’. They pointed out that the
most broadly striking characteristic of FBMs was that their contents carried evident
perceptual features that were reported with an exceptional vividness, as describing the
‘snapshot’ of a photography. In view of this, they argued that ‘flashbulb memory’ was an
appropriate term to define the phenomenon, as it suggested “illumination and brevity”, and
highlighted a “live quality that is almost perceptual” (Brown & Kulik, 1977, p. 74).
Despite the huge interest raised by this first empirical study, Brown and Kulik’s work
has received several critiques. For example, the authors did not provide evidence for the
consistency of these memories, and the hypothesis of a special memory mechanism that
records events in a permanent and indelible way has later been questioned (Neisser & Harsch,
1992). Some studies have challenged the factors that the authors proposed to be FBMs’ main
causal triggers, such as surprise (Curci & Luminet, 2009; Curci et al., 2001; Tinti et al.,
2009); and others have headed attention to further determinants such as general background
knowledge, (Conway et al., 1994; Tinti et al., 2009) and event memory (e.g. Finkenauer et
al., 1998). Nevertheless, by proposing different theoretical models, researchers have shed
light on the factors that are now consensually considered to be the main antecedents of these
memories: importance-consequentiality, emotional reaction, and rehearsal (for a complete
review, see Dumas & Luminet, 2016; Luminet, 2018). However, even though these models
accurately describe the formation of FBMs, researchers have not yet reached a consensus to
explain whether and how these memories may qualitatively differ from ordinary
autobiographical ones (Talarico & Rubin, 2018). To address this issue, we aim to assess the
qualitative component that may give FBMs their unique perceptual ‘live quality’, and to
further investigate whether its role may be pivotal in the recall of canonical categories. We
took on this goal with two test-retest studies in which we conducted a qualitative analysis of
FBMs’ contents.
3.2.1 The debate on flashbulb memories
Over the last four decades, Brown and Kulik’s seminal paper (1977) has raised a
heated debate about the existence of FBMs, in which one of the most controverted issues is
whether they carry a special status of autobiographical memories (Conway et al., 1994;
Kvavilashvili, Mirani, Schlagman, & Kornbrot, 2003; Tinti et al., 2014). An argument in
favour of the so called ‘special status party’ is that a huge part of the details of the reception
context are retained for long periods of time and maintained in an iconic format (Brown &
Kulik, 1977; Conway et al., 1994; Curci et al., 2015; Curci & Luminet, 2009; Kvavilashvili et
al., 2003; Paradis et al., 2004; Tinti et al., 2009). For example, studies conducted on elderly
participants with a single-test methodology found that participants could still provide detailed
and specific accounts of the circumstances in which they learned about important historical
events, even after several decades such as the death of the first president of Turkey, Mustafa
Kemal Atatürk, 58 years after the event (Tekcan & Peynircioğlu, 2002), and the occupation
of Denmark by German troops, 63 years after the event (Berntsen & Thomsen, 2005).
However, FBMs’ extraordinary longevity has not been considered as a sufficient
criterion to define these memories, and the majority of researchers have concentrated on their
consistency (e.g., Curci et al., 2001; Schmolck, Buffalo, & Squire, 2000; Talarico & Rubin,
2003). Thus, although some studies using test-retest designs with retention intervals of
months or years have been able to show that FBMs would be consistently retained in a vivid
and detailed format (Conway et al., 1994; Kvavilashvili et al., 2009, 2003; Tinti et al., 2009),
numerous others have instead shown that these memories typically include inconsistencies,
distortions, repetition errors, and are subject to fading over time, as it occurs for any other
ordinary autobiographical memories (Hirst et al., 2009, 2015; Pezdek, 2003; Schmolck et al.,
2000; Talarico & Rubin, 2003), and are not stored in any particularly iconic format (Cubelli
& Della Sala, 2008). Four decades after Brown and Kulik’s first publication, the debate
around FBMs’ consistency and special status still remains unresolved, and no empirical
studies have attempted to assess whether there exists an iconic component of FBMs, and
whether it may relate to the formation and recall of these memories.
3.2.2 The ‘flash’ in flashbulb memories
Since Brown and Kulik’s first theorization (1977), the yardstick of FBMs’
measurement typically consisted in the assessment of the contents pertaining to the so called
‘canonical categories’. However, as the two authors themselves pointed out, the elements that
make FBMs special are the ones containing vivid frames of the reception context. Indeed,
although Brown and Kulik claimed that canonical categories would constitute the frame of
FBMs’ narrative, they also pointed out the presence of other idiosyncratic elements with
peculiar phenomenological characteristics. Thus, according to this idea, the FBM-eliciting
frame may contain one or more perceptual elements that are recalled with extreme clarity: for
example, the facial expression of the person standing in close proximity, a mug on a desk, the
sound of an ambulance’s sirens, a fragment from the TV delivering the news; all these details
could also, but not only fit under canonical categories. As autobiographical memories, FBMs
are encoded from an egocentric perspective (Nigro & Neisser, 1983) and, according with the
idea of a picture captured by the ‘flash’, they represent short time slices of experiences
(Neisser & Harsch, 1992) and are extremely susceptible to sensory inputs (Conway, 2009).
Consistent with this definition, and with recently developed theories, we could hypothesize
that such perceptual and spatial elements may ground episodic memories more broadly
(Bauer et al., 2012; Berntsen & Rubin, 2006; Rice & Rubin, 2011). Several studies have
indeed shown that episodic memories (Schacter & Addis, 2007) and episodic future thinking
(Hassabis, Kumaran, Vann, & Maguire, 2007; Hassabis & Maguire, 2007) would develop
thanks to the construction of perceptual ‘mental scenes’ that may later facilitate the formation
of coherent memory narratives. Under these premises, we suggest that such processes may as
well characterize the retrieval of the information pertaining to FBMs. In fact, what we will
call ‘flash’ is what captures the perceptive image of the scene that the viewer has in front of
her when she learns the news; as if a camera has focused on a specific detail of the scene,
fired a ‘flash’, and illuminated it for a brief moment. This is probably the reason why
researchers have frequently reported that participants are able to recall a visual image
(Pillemer, 1984; Wolters & Goudsmit, 2005) with a high degree of vividness (Kvavilashvili
et al., 2009; Talarico & Rubin, 2003; Tinti et al., 2014). However, this could also explain
why, when researchers ask participants to report information pertaining to the canonical
categories (Conway et al., 1994; Curci et al., 2001; Finkenauer et al., 1998; Tinti et al., 2009),
they have often found inconsistencies. Indeed, from the reception context’s image, one could
retrieve details which may be the result of reconstructive processes. For example, a person
who has learned the news while in classroom might have encoded the image of a book and a
pen. Nevertheless, when she is later asked to recall the reception context, she may also recall
that the teacher was there, even if this detail was not encoded in the image. This is why, in a
subsequent recollective processing starting from the image of a book and a pen, the
individual might rely on a ‘script’ pertaining to school, and add inconsistent elements,
including the presence of the teacher. Here, some perceptual details may also be part of the
elements of the FBM’s narrative, but the heart of the FBM lies within the image’s perceptual
contents. For this reason, we retain that the assessment of such perceptual elements may shed
light on the nature of FBMs. Actually, although the studies mentioned above have considered
FBMs’ iconic component, none of them has addressed the independent role of perceptual
details in FBM’s recall – rather, they have mainly accounted them as a part of FBMs and not
as its core (Curci et al., 2001; Finkenauer et al., 1998).
3.2.3 Hypotheses
In the present work, we investigate the qualitative contents that define FBMs. We
posit that the phenomenology of FBMs may be characterised by the presence of a number of
perceptual details that are stored in a mental image of the individual’s reception context. We
hypothesized that this image is captured when the individual first learns about a news that has
triggered an intense emotion. This image contains the elements that the individual’s
perceptual system has detected in that precise moment, as a ‘flash’ has illuminated some
details of the reception context, and permanently stored them in memory. For example, a
person who learns about the news from a colleague, may have stored in mind a visual image
of the face expression of her colleague, or some details that were captured in that context. We
labelled these elements ‘perceptive core images’, and we hypothesized that they would
determine the iconic ‘live quality’ of FBMs. Perceptive core images embody the elements of
a memory component which we operationalized according to three defining characteristics:
vividness, consistency, and perceptive ‘live quality’. Moreover, we postulated perceptive
core images as being crucial to construct a coherent memory narrative.
In two studies, we developed a procedure to assess perceptive core images and tested
the mechanisms underlying their formation and their relationship with canonical categories’
recall. We used a structural equation model that accounted for canonical categories,
perceptive core images, and seven additional latent variables: novelty, importance-
1). Drawing on previous models (Finkenauer et al., 1998; Tinti et al., 2014), we tested the
following hypotheses: (1) novelty and importance-consequentiality are the antecedents of,
respectively, surprise and other emotions; (2) knowledge of the event is one of the
antecedents of event memory’s accuracy; (3) emotions lead to event memory’s accuracy via
rehearsal of the news. Moreover, (4) we aim to test the relation between event memory and
FBM, as its role in the formation of FBM is still unclear (Finkenauer et al., 1998; Tinti et al.,
2014). Finally, regarding perceptive core images, we predict that: (5) strong emotions and
surprise lead to the formation of perceptive core images; (6) perceptive core images are the
direct determinants of canonical categories’ recall.

3.2.4 Overview of the studies
We tested our model over two studies in which we adopted a test-retest design with
retention intervals of 6 and 18 months respectively. In both studies, we used a memory
questionnaire (Conway et al., 1994; Finkenauer et al., 1998; Tinti et al., 2014) that examined
canonical categories’ and event memory’s contents, the appraisals of novelty and importance-
consequentiality, surprise, emotional reactions, rehearsal, prior knowledge, and that
additionally focused on perceptive core images.
In Study 1, we assessed Italian Catholics’ reactions and memories in relation to the
resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, who announced his will on February 28th, 2013, after an
8-year papacy. His resignation left Catholics disoriented and shocked. To appreciate how
unexpected and astonishing this event was, it should be noted that Pope Benedict XVI was
the first Pope to resign, on his own initiative, since Pope Celestine V in 1294. Thus, the event
was not only totally unexpected but also a unique event for the modern Catholic Church and
for the Italian people in general. In Study 2, we examined the terrorist attacks that happened
in Paris during the night between November 13th and 14th of 2015. Because of its brutality,
this event threw France and entire Europe in a state of anguish and fear. For ethical reasons,
and with respect to the climate of terror that was spread all over the French nation during the
days after the event, we chose not to interview French people. Rather, we addressed our study
to Italian students, who we expected to be strongly affected by the event as well.
To summarize, the present work aims to shed light to the qualitative components that
constitute FBMs and the mechanisms underpinning their recall. To do so, we investigate the
presence of a distinctive iconic component we called ‘core image’, and propose a new
theoretical model to explain its role in the recall of FBMs.
3.3 Study 1: The resignation of Pope Benedict XVI
3.3.1 Material and Methods
3.3.1.1 Participants
At T1, the survey was distributed to and completed by 403 Italians. 212 participants
took part also in the retest (T2.) Among them, eight were excluded from the analyses as it
was impossible to match their surveys, or because they did not fully complete the survey. The
final sample was composed of 204 participants, 85% of which were practicing Catholics.
Their age ranged between 18 and 80 (M= 37.45; SD= 16.60), and 74.5% were women. A
total of 39.7% of participants were students from the University of Turin, 45% were
employed and self-employed workers, 15.3% retired and housewives recruited from
communities of the Catholic Church of Turin, Italy.
3.3.1.2 Procedure
Participants completed the first survey (T1) between 5 and 15 days after the Pope’s
resignation. The surveys were distributed by trained research assistants from the University
of Turin and completed by pencil and paper. Participants were asked to create their personal
code composed of two numbers (i.e., the day of their birthday), and four letters (i.e., the first
two letters of their name, and the last two letters of their mother’s name). On a separate sheet,
they were asked to report their email address in order to be re-contacted for the retest.
Participants completed the second survey (T2) six months after. The survey was sent to their
email address and completed via Google forms. The two surveys belonging to the same
participant were matched according to the personal code that participants reported at both T1
and T2. All the participants completed the surveys in Italian and took part at the study
voluntarily. They were informed that the surveys were anonymous and that the data would be
used for research purposes only.
3.3.1.3 Survey and scoring procedure
The same survey was used for T1 and T2, starting with the informed consent and a short
introduction to the study. The questionnaire assessed canonical categories, perceptive core
images, and their possible determinants of formation and maintenance (Brown & Kulik,
1977; Conway et al., 1994; Finkenauer et al., 1998; Tinti et al., 2014). The labels of the
indicators we used in tables A and B (supplementary material) and in the model path
diagrams (cf. Figures 2 and 3), are reported in parentheses. The latent variables and the
indicators we used to measure them are described below.
Novelty. The appraisal of novelty was assessed through one item on an 11-points scale
(0=not at all, 10=extremely): “To what extent has this event been unexpected?” (Unexp). For
the model the answers at T1 were considered.
Importance and consequentiality. The appraisals of importance and consequentiality
entailed 4 items associated to 11-points scales (0=not at all, 10=extremely) assessing to
which extent the event was important for participants personally (IpPers), and could have
consequences respectively on their personal life, the Catholic Church followers, and the
Catholic Church in general. The mean of the ratings of these last three items assessed at T1 (α
= .65) was used as an indicator of consequentiality (Csq).
Surprise. Participants were asked to rate how surprised (Surp) they were about the
news on a scale ranging from 0 (not surprised at all) to 10 (very surprised).
Emotional reaction. Participants were asked to rate from 0 (no intensity) to 10 (very
intense) the intensity they felt for each of the following emotions: fear, anger, sadness,
happiness, anxiety, satisfaction, hope, frustration. In addition, at the end of this section, they
were asked to rate on a further 11-points scale their general emotional intensity toward the
news. For the model, we considered as indicators the following emotions that reached a mean
emotional intensity (EInt).
Rehearsal. Participants were asked to report on two 11-points scales (0=not at all,
10=extremely) how frequently they had spoken about the event (SpkEv) and the personal
circumstances in which they were when they first learned about it (SpkC). In addition, they
were asked to rate from 0 (no time) to 7 (more than 5 hours) how much time they had spent
following the news about the event in the media coverage (News). For the model we
considered the answers at T1.
Vividness. By using an 11-points scale (0=not at all, 10=extremely), participants were
asked to rate how vivid the image they had in mind of the moment they learned about the
news was, and they were instructed to mark ‘zero’ in case they had no images in mind.
Perceptive core images. Using a free-recall task, participants were asked to recall the
details of their mental image. Since our main concern was to assess the perceptive component
of memory, and in order to avoid any narrative-like recall, we presented them with 8 separate
blank spaces in which they could report any detail they wished, without any restriction to fill
them all. Participants were informed that details could be of any type or length, and they were
encouraged to report them even if they may seem irrelevant or expressed in a non-coherent
form. This procedure was developed with the aim to assess participants’ spontaneous recall
and to minimize possible biases due to inferential processing (Cubelli & Della Sala, 2008).
To code perceptive core images, we adapted part of the procedure of Hassabis and
Maguire (2007) used in the scene construction theory, and part of the criteria Finkenauer et
al. used to measure the perceptual features of FBMs (1998, p. 522). We assigned a score of 1
whenever a detail meeting at least one of the following criteria was consistent between T1
and T2:
- it encompassed explicit statements regarding the relative position of entities
within the environment or directions relative to the participant’s point of view
(e.g. ‘my husband was sitting on my left hand side’; ‘The cat was curled up on the
left side of the couch’);
- it encompassed explicit references to distinct entities that the participant could see
in her mental image (e.g. ‘I was laying in my bed with the book of biology on my
legs’; ‘I clearly remember my friend’s eyebrow’);
- it consisted of any statements describing specific properties of an entity (e.g. ‘I
was drinking coffee from a red mug’; ‘I was wearing a light blue cardigan’) as
well as weather and atmosphere descriptions and auditory, olfactory, tactile details
about an object (e.g., ‘I could hear the washing machine noise on the
background’).
Consistent details were summed up into an index that ranged from 0 to 8 (Consist),
and, together with vividness at T2 (Vivid), was used as an indicator of perceptive core images
(CORE). The contents pertaining to perceptive core images were scored by the first author,
and then by a trained research assistant from the University of Turin, who was instructed to
the use of the criteria described above. The average measure of intraclass correlation (ICC)
showed a good agreement between the two coders (ICC = .84, F(203, 203) = 6.28, p < .001,
95% CI [.79, .88]). Any divergences between the two judges were resolved by consensus.
Canonical categories. We assessed Brown and Kulik’s canonical categories
(1977) in five cued-recall questions. Participants were asked to report the source of news,
where they were when they first learned the news, what they were doing when they first
learned the news, who was with them, and what they did in the immediate aftermath. Each
content was scored 2 when the answer at T2 was consistent with the answer at T1, 1 when it
was partially consistent, and 0 when it was inconsistent. For example, when a participant
reported the same information at both tests with the same richness of details, a score of 2 was
given (e.g., for the category ‘ongoing activity’, at T1: ‘I was cooking dinner while speaking
with my husband’; at T2: ‘I was chatting with my husband, and I was preparing the dinner’).
If at T2 the participant recalled only part of the details reported at T1, a score of 1 was given.
For example, within the category ‘place’, if the participant at T1 reported ‘I was on the sofa
in my living room’, and then at T2 reported ‘I was at home’, a score of 1 was attributed.
Finally, when participants failed to provide an answer at T1 or T2, or provided different
information between the two tests, a score of 0 was given. To sum up, the canonical
categories’ latent variable (CC) counted five indicators scored according to their consistency:
informant (Inf), place (Place), ongoing activity (Action), others present (Others), and
immediate aftermath (After). Canonical categories’ contents were scored by the first author
among all participants, while a trained research assistant provided a second scoring for 102
(50%) randomly selected participants. To gain an inter-judge index, we summed up the
scores attributed to the five canonical categories into a continuum ranging from 0 to 10. The
average measure of intraclass correlation (ICC) showed an excellent agreement between the
two coders (ICC = .98, F(101, 101) = 46.66, p < .001, 95% CI [.96, .99]).
General knowledge. General knowledge regarding religion and the Catholic Church
was assessed through 16 open-ended questions entailing the recall of 26 information (e.g.
“What was the name of the Pope who resigned in 1294?”, “Please, list the seven
sacraments”). Answers were assessed at T1 and scored according to their accuracy (0=
inaccurate or missing; 1= accurate). Since almost the totality of participants scored 0 in two
questions, these two questions were excluded from the analysis. Thus, summing up the
scores, participants could reach a maximum of 24. As is common in analyses involving
achievement scales with items scored as correct or incorrect, items were parcelled to improve
the normality and continuity of the variables’ distributions (Bandalos & Finney, 2001;
Landis, Beal, & Tesluk, 2000). We first estimated a Rasch model (Rasch, 1960) to ascertain
the unidimensionality of the scale (α = .83). Then we constructed two equivalent general
knowledge subscales by summing odd items and even items separately. General knowledge
was thus measured by the number of correct answers to the twelve odd questions (scores
ranged from 0 to 12, Knw1) and the number of correct answers to the twelve even questions
(scores ranged from 0 to 12, Knw2).
Event memory and confidence. 12 open-ended questions assessed participants’
recall of factual information about the event (e.g., ‘What were the main reasons why Pope
Benedict XVI resigned?’, ‘In which language has Pope Benedict XVI announced his
resignation?’). For each question, participants were asked to rate from 0 (not at all) to 10
(extremely) how confident they were about the answer they provided. A mean of the
confidence scores was calculated to create an indicator of event memory certainty (CertEv).
Event memory answers were scored according to their accuracy at T2 (0= inaccurate or
missing; 1= partially accurate; 2= accurate). Thus summing up the scores, participants could
reach a maximum score of 24. Also in this case a Rasch analysis supported the
unidimensionality of the scale (α =.73). To create the indicators of event memory, we
followed the same strategy of item parcelling we used for general knowledge, for the same
reasons explained above. Thus, event memory was measured by the total number of correct
answers to the six odd questions (scores ranged from 0 to 12, EV1) and to the six even
questions (scores ranged from 0 to 12, EV2).
Demographic information: Participants were asked to report their age, se title of
study, and city of residence.
3.3.1.4 Statistical analyses
We conducted two steps of analyses: (1) descriptive analyses of the variables assessed
and used for the model creation and (2) structural equation modelling to test the relationship
between the different determinants of the formation and recall of the perceptive core images
tested utilising LISREL 8.7 (Jöreskog & Söbom, 2005). We evaluated the goodness of fit of
the resulting models by using the following indexes: RMSEA was used to evaluate the
approximation of the model-implied matrix to those of the population, CFI was used to
compare the fit of the hypothesised model with that one of the null model, and SRMR was
used to indicate the degree of discrepancy between the sample covariance matrix and the
covariance matrix implied by the model. We used the following criteria to evaluate the fit of
our models as acceptable: SRMR £.10, CFI ≥.95, RMSEA £.08 (Schermelleh-Engel,
Moosbrugger, & Müller, 2003). Since variables in both studies were not multinormal
(Mardia’s test with Prelis: Study 1, χ2(2, N = 204) = 123.92, p < .001; Study 2, χ2(2, N = 151)
= 33.22, p < .001), we used MLR (Robust Maximum Likelihood method) for the models’
estimation. The correlation matrices of the variables used to compute the two structural

the highest number of consistent perceptive core images at T2 was 5); c 0 to 24. If not
otherwise specified, scales ranged from 0 to 10.
As we can observe, the event was appraised as very unexpected. For the appraisals of
importance and consequentiality, the event was experienced as moderately important on a
personal level, and moderately consequential for the Catholic Church and its followers.
However, the reported level of consequentiality for personal life was rather low. With respect
to the emotions, the event was remarkable for the high levels of surprise that it triggered.
Nevertheless, general emotional intensity was moderate, and only the mean intensities of
sadness and hope exceeded the level of 2, while the intensities of the other emotions were
very low. Also, participants moderately talked about the event, but did not speak a lot about
the circumstance in which they learned about it and moderately rehearsed the news through
mediums. Participants’ mental image about the reception context of the news at T2 was quite
vivid. The highest number of consistently reported perceptive core images at T2 was 5. More
in detail, 32.4% of participants could not recall any core image, while 67.6% of them
reported one or more perceptive core images (1 core: 20.1%, 2 cores 24%, 3 cores: 13.7%, 4
cores: 5.9%, 5 cores: 3.9%). Knowledge about Catholic Church was average and the answers
concerning the memory of the event were recalled at T2 with average accuracy and
participants who respectively recalled a consistent, partially consistent or inconsistent answer
in relation to each canonical category. As we can observe, the information relative to other
people present, the place, and the informant were reported with the highest level of
consistency by the vast majority of participants. Over half of participants were consistent in
reporting their ongoing activity, and 34.8% of them could report a consistent information
about the immediate aftermath.

3.3.2.2 Structural equation model
Since in this work it is the first time that a distinction between Perceptive core images
(CORE) and Canonical Categories (CC) is introduced, we verified that CORE and CC could
effectively be considered as two distinct latent variables before testing the hypothesised
structural model. To do this we computed a unidimensional confirmatory factor analysis
(RMSEA = .143; CFI = .769; SRMR = .090) and a bidimensional one (RMSEA = .048; CFI
= .974; SRMR = .041). As shown by the fit indexes, the unidimensional solution is
structural equation model. The factors underlying the observed variables are represented by
circles, and the variables are represented by squares. The single-headed arrows indicate the
relations between the different latent factors and between latent factors and their respective
indicators.

formation through perceptive core images: Study 1.
Overall, the model confirmed our hypotheses and showed a good statistical fit to the
data: RMSEA = .051; CFI = .965; SRMR = .084. The appraisal of novelty predicted surprise,
and higher appraisals of importance/consequentiality predicted higher intensity of other
emotions. A more general knowledge about Catholic Church predicted a more accurate recall
of event memory. High general emotion intensity and sadness and hope predicted frequent
rehearsal, which in turn predicted accuracy of event memory. Perceptive core images were
predicted by high levels of surprise, but not by the intensity of other emotional feelings; in
turn, perceptive core images predicted the consistency of canonical categories’ recall.
Importantly, we found that the formation of perceptive core images was facilitated by high
levels of surprise, but not by general emotion. We attribute this result to the nature of the
event: as we can observe from the descriptive statistics reported above, the resignation of
Pope Benedict XVI did not raise a high general emotional intensity, nor high levels of
intensity among the single emotions. But yet, it triggered high levels of surprise. Therefore,
surprise was the prevalent emotion and the one responsible for the formation and
maintenance of perceptive core images. With respect to the role of perceptive core images,
we confirmed our main hypothesis: vivid perceptive core images predicted the consistent
recall of canonical categories. This result sheds light on important differences with other
models, inasmuch it provided evidence of a novel pathway involved in the formation of
canonical categories. Indeed, contrary to previous ones (e.g., Er, 2003; Finkenauer et al.,
1998; Tinti et al., 2009), our model shows that event memory and rehearsal does not directly
determine canonical categories’ recall. Rather, we showed that the recall of event memory
and canonical categories do not relate to each other (Tinti et al., 2014), and that the only
determinant of canonical categories are perceptive core images.
3.4 Study 2: The terrorist attacks of November 2015 in Paris
3.4.1 Material and Methods
3.4.1.1 Participants
305 participants took part at the first stage of the study (T1). At the second phase (T2),
158 participants completed the survey. Seven participants were excluded from the analysis:
three of them failed to provide their personal code, and therefore their two surveys could not
be matched, and four of them did not fully complete the survey. The final sample was
composed of 151 participants. Participants were psychology students from the University of
Turin (68.7% undergraduate, 31.3% master students). Their age ranged between 18 and 32
(M= 21.17; SD= 3.04). 79% were women.
3.4.1.2 Procedure
The procedure is similar to the one used in Study 1. However, we extended the time
delay between the two tests for two reasons: first, we were interested in testing our model
over a larger latency, and second, we hypothesised that after six months the event would have
still been too intense and too central in media coverage. Therefore, this study involved an 18-
months delay. Participants completed the first survey (T1) between 5 and 15 days after the
terrorist attack in Paris. The surveys were distributed by the first author during scheduled
lessons and were completed by pencil and paper. The same matching procedure of study 1
was used (personal code and email address on a separate sheet). Participants were re-
contacted with their email address and asked to complete the re-test (T2) via the online
survey platform Qualtrics. Participants completed the surveys in Italian and took part
voluntarily; they were informed that the surveys were anonymous and that the data would be
used for research purposes only.
3.4.1.3 Survey and scoring procedure
The survey was identical to the one we developed for Study 1. However, the items
pertaining to the following variables were adapted to the event. The appraisals of importance
and consequentiality entailed 5 items associated to 11-points scales (0=not at all,
10=extremely) assessing the event’s personal importance for the participants (IpPers), and
consequentiality for themselves, for Italy, France, and at an international level at T1. The
mean of these last four items (α = .73) was used to create the indicator of consequentiality
(Csq). General knowledge about international politics was measured using 8 open-ended
questions entailing 8 items (e.g. ‘Who is the current president of Syria?’, ‘When did the
Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack happen?’). Questions were assessed at T1 and scored
according to their accuracy (0= inaccurate or missing; 1= accurate) and summed up.
Following the strategy used in Study 1, once the unidimensionality of the scale has been
verified by a Rasch model (α = .63), odd and even questions were respectively summed up to
create two indicators of knowledge (Knw1 and Knw2, both ranking from 0 to 4). Regarding
emotions, by using 11-points scales (0= not intense at all, 10= very intense), we assessed the
intensity of eight emotions (fear, anxiety, anger, hate, sadness, compassion, frustration,
distrust), and the general emotional intensity. A parallel analysis followed by an explorative
factor analysis computed on the eight emotions resulted in two correlated factors
differentiating fear and anxiety form the other emotions. The mean of fear and anxiety
(Emo1, α = .83), the mean of the six remaining emotions (Emo2, α = .77), and the general
emotional intensity (EInt) were used as indicators of Emotions. Event memory (EVM)
entailed 14 open-ended questions focusing on factual information about the event (e.g., ‘How
many victims did the event count?’, ‘What was the group that was playing in the Bataclan
theatre?’). Answers were scored according to their accuracy at T2 (0= inaccurate or missing;
1= accurate) and summed up (range: 0-14). Again, after the verification of the
unidimensionality of the scale (α =.71), we created two indicators (ranging from 0 to 7) of
event memory (EV1 and EV2). Confidence ratings were assessed and their mean value was
calculated to create the indicator CertEV. The assessments of vividness, perceptive core
images, canonical categories, novelty, surprise, and rehearsal did not differ from Study 1, as
well as the scoring procedure of the qualitative contents. Hence, similar to Study 1,
perceptive core images were scored from the first author and a trained research assistant from
the University of Turin across the whole sample, achieving a high inter-judge agreement
(ICC = .86, F(150, 150) = 8.44, p < .001, 95% CI [.77, .91]); while a second scoring was
provided for canonical categories among a number of 75 (49.7%) randomly selected cases,
and reliability between the two judges was very high (ICC = .93, F(203, 203) = 6.28, p <
.001, 95% CI [.79, .88]).

As we can observe, the event was appraised as highly unexpected and highly personally
important. Appraisal of consequentiality was moderate for personal life and for Italy, while
we could almost observe a ceiling effect on consequentiality for France and at the
international level. Concerning the emotional reactions, participants were highly surprised by
the event, and they experienced high intensities of negative emotions, especially sadness and
compassion, as well as a high general emotion intensity. Participants frequently rehearsed the
event through conversations with others, and moderately followed the news on the media.
However, they did not very frequently talk about the circumstances in which they learned the
news of the event. At T2, participants rated the vividness of the mental image of their
reception context of the news as high, while the highest number of reported perceptive core
images was 5. More in detail, 27.2% of participants did not recall any perceptive core images,
the remaining 72.8% could report one or more (1 core: 21.9%, 2 cores 20.5%, 3 cores:
14.6%, 4 cores: 9.3%, 5 cores: 6.6%). Knowledge about international politics was rather low,
as well as event memory’s accuracy and confidence. Finally, as to the canonical categories,
the vast majority of participants were able to report a consistent information in relation to
others present, and place, followed by informant and activity, while the information
pertaining to the immediate aftermath was not reported consistently by a high part of
inconsistent answers for each canonical category: Study 2

3.4.2.2 Structural equation model
As in study 1, before testing the hypothesised structural model, we verified that CORE
and CC could effectively be considered as two distinct latent variables. Both, the
unidimensional solution (RMSEA = .090; CFI = .933; SRMR = .060) as well as the
bidimensional one (RMSEA = .065; CFI = .968; SRMR = .053) lead to reasonable fit
indexes, but the scaled difference chi-square showed that the bidimensional solution was
equation model.

formation through perceptive core images: Study 2.
Overall, the proposed model showed an acceptable statistical fit to the data: RMSEA
= .054; CFI = .943; SRMR = .083, and supported our hypotheses: the appraisal of novelty
predicted surprise, and higher appraisals of importance/consequentiality predicted higher
intensity of other emotions. A more general knowledge about politics predicted increased
accuracy and certainty of event memory; high emotional intensity predicted more frequent
rehearsal, which in turn, predicted event memory. At encoding, perceptive core images were
predicted by high levels of emotional intensity, but not by surprise; finally, perceptive core
images predicted the consistency of canonical categories’ recall, while event memory did not.
Importantly, this model showed that perceptive core images were determined by intense
emotions (and not by surprise, as found in Study 1). We attribute this finding to the specific
nature of the event: although highly surprising, the terrorist attack of Paris has been
exceptional for the intense negative emotions it triggered. In fact, more than the resignation
of Pope Benedict XVI, this event raised highly intense emotions that emerged to be
responsible for the formation and maintenance of perceptive core images, which in turn
determined the recall of canonical categories. Besides this difference observed in the
formation of perceptive core images, the model of this study is consistent with the one
obtained in Study 1.
3.5 General discussion
One key debate in the literature on FBMs is whether these memories carry a special
status of autobiographical memories. Here, we addressed this issue by analysing the
qualitative contents that may give FBMs a unique ‘live quality’. To do so, we introduced the
concept of perceptive core images, a component that may be paramount to characterize the
FBMs’ phenomenon. Following the metaphor of a photography (Brown & Kulik, 1977), we
defined perceptive core images as perceptual memory contents that are captured when the
‘flash’ – aroused by emotions – is fired on one or more specific details of the reception
context. This image would therefore have a strong iconic component and would remain vivid
at the time of recall, even after a long time. Most importantly, this image would persist
accurately, and would be crucially involved in the recall of a coherent narrative.
In two longitudinal studies, we developed a procedure to assess the contents of
perceptive core images and their role in relation to canonical categories. Results of qualitative
analyses showed that respectively 68% and 73% of the participants of the two studies were
able to recall one or more perceptive core images within a retention time of 6 and 18 months
respectively. A structural equation model revealed that perceptive core images directly
determined canonical categories’ consistent recall, regardless of the type of event. The
proposed model showed that perceptive core images were formed along two paths: the first
one implies that the event is appraised as highly important and consequential, and therefore
capable of raising an intense emotional reaction; while the second one is activated when the
event is appraised as highly novel and therefore triggering high levels of surprise. Such
difference reflected the nature of the events we investigated: while the resignation of Pope
Benedict elicited principally high ratings of surprise, the news of Paris’ terrorist attacks
triggered surprise, but also very intense negative emotions. These results could indicate that
what matters is not the type of emotion, but its intensity, and could explain the discordance of
previous results upon the role of surprise (Coluccia et al., 2010; Finkenauer et al., 1998).
Our work provides empirical evidence in support of the iconicity of FBMs and
suggests that the contents of these memories may be defined not only under canonical
categories, but also, and especially, under perceptive core images. Canonical categories and
perceptive core images are strictly related. However, while perceptive core images contain a
sharp image of a frame that the person captured when she first learned the news, as if a
camera zoomed in, canonical categories could also contain elements that she needs to
construct a coherent narrative. Hence, we suggest that FBMs would raise from the interplay
between the two components, meaning that perceptive core images’ contents may overlap
with canonical categories’ ones, inasmuch the former encompass a mental image whose
perceptual elements (e.g., the astonished face expression of a colleague) could also fit within
the latter (e.g., the abovementioned colleague might be the source of the news). Such
interplay is pivotal in understanding the role of perceptive core images in the construction of
FBMs. Hence, we suggest that the recollective process of a coherent memory may develop
around one or more perceptive core images of the reception context. Let’s take as an example
some perceptive core images: my colleague’s phone on my desk, an excel file open on my
laptop, the voice of the radio speaker. Taken together, these details may suggest that the
person was in the office when she first learned the news, and these details may successively
facilitate her recall consistent with the exact activity she was engaged in at that time, as well
as cueing who else was present, who the informant was, and other similar pieces of
information. This example reflects a process that is supported by our results, as across both
studies perceptive core images were the direct determinant of canonical categories.
Importantly, no direct link between perceptive core images and rehearsal was found, as the
reiterative process is more likely to involve the details pertaining to event memory, rather
than the details of the reception context’s image, as these latter are fixed once the ‘flash’ has
occurred. This not only implies that what makes perceptive core images unique is their
perceptual nature, and the vividness they carry during recollection, but also that, once
formed, they remain consistent over time – which may not always be the case for canonical
categories, as they may be the result of reconstructive processes (Hirst et al., 2009, 2015).
Overall, this framework prompts important theoretical considerations in explaining
the inconsistency problem that FBMs’ literature has ever long faced. Indeed, the presence of
perceptive core images does not exclude that the person may engage in a biased recollective
process and build an inconsistent narrative around the image she holds in mind. This process
implies that cores images can lead to an impaired scene construction that, in turn, could rely
on ‘memory scripts’. For example, in the scenario we described above, one could picture in
her mind a desk, a mug of coffee, or a laptop, and, nonetheless, add further details which are
consistent with the ‘office scenario’, such as the presence of a colleague. In terms of
canonical categories, the ‘location’ of learning the news is correct, but the ‘others present’ is
not. Thus, perceptive core images can contain elements that may consistently fit under
canonical categories, but that may as well be the cue to erroneous reconstructions. In this
case, the consistency of perceptive core images is not at stake, but the consistency of the
other elements of the narrative may be.
To conclude, we believe that our proposed theoretical frame may address the long
lasting debate regarding the nature of FBMs. In this respect, the strength of the present work
lies in the study of the perceptual elements that are captured when the ‘flash’ is fired and that
we called ‘perceptive core images’. To reach this aim, we developed a novel methodology to
assess the perceptive contents of FBMs, and tested our hypothesis across two longitudinal
studies with large retention intervals. Moreover, we provided evidence that our theoretical
model applies among events of different nature, making our findings even more robust. We
suggest future research on FBMs takes into account the presence of perceptive core images,
as they appear to embody the iconic heart of these memories, and to determine their recall
over time.
3.6 Conclusion
The question whether FBMs are a special class of autobiographical memories
represents a thorny issue in memory research. In this work, we took part to the current FBMs’
debate presenting a new theoretical frame in which these memories are constructed through
perceptive core images: perceptual, consistent, and vivid memory contents that are formed
when the event of news has triggered a strong emotion. This frame would help explaining
why FBMs often combine inconsistencies with striking levels of vividness and confidence.
CHAPTER 4. Flashbulb and event memory of Brexit: a cross-national study of their
phenomenology across 11 and 23 months
4.1 Abstract
When people learn about an important event, they usually encode in memory some
details about the facts of the event – i.e., event memory (EM) – as well as details of the
context in which they learned about it – i.e., flashbulb memory (FBM). However, the factors
facilitating the encoding of such details, and the way in which they are retrieved over time is
still unclear. In the present study, we investigate the phenomenology, recollective experience,
and the factors associated with the long-term retention of FBMs and EMs relative to the UK
referendum on EU membership across two national groups of English and Italian citizens.
Results show that the retention of the two is independent: while FBMs are consistent and
boosted of new details over time, EMs’ accuracy endures the effect of time. Moreover, by
using a R/K/F/G paradigm, we found that, at retrieval, FBMs are characterized by
‘Remember’ judgments, while EMs are characterized by ‘Know’, ‘Familiar’, and ‘Guess’
ones. Finally, amongst all, the factor associated with FBMs’ consistent recall was the initial
appraisal of importance-consequentiality at all tests; whereas EMs’ accuracy was predicted
by the subsequent rehearsal of the event via speaking and thinking. Taken together, these
results suggest that the phenomenology, recollective experience, and predictors of FBMs and
EMs can be clearly distinguished. Theoretical implications are discussed in light of the
existence of two different memory systems.

On 24 June 2016, English citizens’ morning routines were invested by a remarkable
news: the referendum held the day before had determined that the United Kingdom should
leave the European Union. While media coverages started to spread out information
regarding the victory of the Leave party, (e.g., the percentage of voters, a map of the cities
voting the ‘Leave’), most people remained astonished for a moment, probably capturing a
record of the circumstances in which they were when the result was announced. Events like
these can produce vivid and detailed memories entailing a first-person perspective of how the
news was learned, as well as a number of factual information about the original event. Do
these two sets of information rely to different memory systems? If so, do they evolve over
time along diverse patterns and from different predictors?
These questions have tickled the interest of memory researchers ever since Brown and
Kulik (1977) inaugurated the area of study that is ‘flashbulb memories (FBMs)’. FBMs have
been typically defined as recalls of the context in which an individual first learns about a
particularly consequential and emotionally arousing public news – e.g., the where, when, and
how the news was learned. A peculiarity of these contents is that they are retrieved with
extraordinary vividness (Kvavilashvili et al., 2009) and confidence, regardless of their
consistency (Neisser et al., 1996; Talarico & Rubin, 2003). Beside the information pertaining
to the reception context’s attributes, people are also able to recollect some facts of the event
in itself – e.g., the where, when, and how the event took place. Recollections of this type fit
under the name of ‘event memories, (EMs)’ , as opposed to FBM, they do not encompass
autobiographical elements (Neisser & Harsch, 1992). This difference has raised a number of
fundamental empirical questions concerning whether the two may vary both across their
determinants and phenomenological characteristics. FBM and EM have indeed been
conceptualized as pertaining to different memory systems (Bohannon & Symons, 1992;
Finkenauer et al., 1998; M. C. Smith et al., 2003; Tinti et al., 2014), as their contents would
be ‘perceived and processed separately’ (Pezdek, 2003, p. 1035): while FBM might vary
among each individual, EM should be the same for everyone, since it concerns the objective
facts of the event. This distinction has further driven some researchers to disentangle the
reiterative processes that would come about from FBM and EM – one entailing the
individual’s personal context of learning the news, and one concerning the facts of the event
via conversation with others and media coverage (Tinti et al., 2014).
In relation to their recollective experience, researchers have compared FBM’s and
EM’s recalls as reflecting autonoetic and noetic consciousness, based on retrieval from
episodic and semantic memory respectively (Tulving, 1985). To investigate the two, they
have typically adopted the Remember-Know paradigm (Rimmele et al., 2012), and its related
version which encompasses ‘Familiar’ and ‘Guess’ judgments (Stone, Luminet, & Takahashi,
2015; H. L. Williams, Conway, & Moulin, 2013): a ‘Remember’ judgement would reflect an
episodic-like recall; a ‘Know’ judgment is linked to a semantic-like knowledge of the event;
and ‘Familiar’ and ‘Guess’ ones would reflect lower confidence ratings on a recalled
information.
From a structural point of view, there is sufficient agreement on the determinants of
the two: while the formation of EM would be mostly maintained by the effect of post-
encoding factors such as rehearsal people engage with throughout media coverage and
conversation (Tinti et al., 2014), FBM would be prompted by encoding factors such as the
appraisal of importance-consequentiality and its subsequent emotional reaction (Finkenauer
et al., 1998; Tinti et al., 2009). In this regard, several authors have highlighted the role of the
person’s proximity to the event (Pezdek, 2003), affective attitude (Conway et al., 1994),
social bond (Day & Ross, 2014), and appraisals (Tinti et al., 2009) in shaping the trajectories
of both FBM and EM. For example, research conducted across different social groups
reported major differences on FBM’s consistency and EM’s accuracy as a function of
participants’ appraisals toward the event, reflecting that greater importance-consequentiality
is associated with greater memory consistency/accuracy (Conway et al., 1994; Larsen, 1992;
Tinti et al., 2009). Such studies have highlighted the role of social identity, showing that
FBMs and EMs are more likely to be formed when the event affects the individual’s social
group (Berntsen, 2018).
However, as pertaining to their phenomenology, research has provided uniform
results upon the high levels of vividness and confidence that characterize these memories at
retrieval (Pillemer, 1984; Talarico & Rubin, 2003), while those regarding their e
consistency ar
still contrasting. The vast majority of studies assessing the contents of both FBMs and EMs
over time have used a single re-test methodology with time delays ranging from 8 to 10
months on average. For example, in a study targeting to the death of French President
Mitterrand among Belgian and French participants, Curci et al. (2001) found that, overall,
EM’s accuracy remained stable over time, while FBM was subject to a decrease. Conversely,
in their study on the death of Pope John Paul II, Tinti et al. (2009) observed that EM’s
accuracy strongly decreased over time, but not FBM’s consistency. However, some authors
have pointed out that short retention times might be associated with greater memory
consistency (Schmolck et al., 2000). Indeed, the framework of these memories’
phenomenology appears even more heterogeneous when looking at the studies investigating
their accuracy across more than a single re-test and with larger retention times. Some studies
have investigated the contents of FBMs and EMs by using a two re-tests methodology
entailing 6- and a 12-month time lags respectively. For example, Coluccia, Bianco, and
Brandimonte (2010) reported no changes over time neither in EMs’ nor in FBMs’ recall. In
contrast, Tekcan (2003) found that FBM remained consistent, unlike EM, which stabilized at
the second re-test, after a strong decrease between the initial assessment and the first re-test.
Finally, the only study measuring FBMs’ and EM’s contents over long time delays and with a
multiple re-test methodology (i.e., three re-tests within a time span of ten years) is the one
conducted by Hirst et al. (2009, 2015) on the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The authors observed that
both FBMs and EMs dropped after one year, but that the inconsistencies pertaining to the
former were more likely to be successively repeated, while the inaccuracies of the latter were
more likely to be corrected by the effect of media attention. Importantly, Hirst and colleagues
also showed that, across ten years, none of the investigated putative variables such as
consequentiality, emotional reaction, media attention, and rehearsal via conversation
predicted FBM’s consistent recall, while only media attention and rehearsal via conversation
predicted EM’s accuracy.
Taken together, these findings not only uncover important theoretical controversies
upon the conceptualization of FBMs and EMs, but also a number of methodological issues
pertaining to the frequency and delay of the re-tests to be used to track their evolution over
time. Moreover, they emphasize the need of control groups to naturally assess the effect of
possible latent variables such as importance-consequentiality and proximity to the event. To
overcome these issues, the present study tracks FBMs’ and EMs’ recalls over two re-tests
with a time delay of 11 and 23 months from the original event, across two groups that differ
for their proximity to the event. This methodology will allow us to: (1) observe the changes
in vividness and confidence among three time points (Talarico & Rubin, 2007); (2) measure
FBM’s consistency between the initial assessment and two separate re-tests (Hirst et al.,
2009; Schmolck et al., 2000); (3) gather a measure of FBM’s consistency between the first
and the second re-test (Hirst et al., 2015); (4) measure EM’s accuracy across three time points
(Tekcan et al., 2003); (5) observe the changes over time in the distribution of Remember,
Know, Familiar, and Guess judgments among FBMs and EMs (in a R/K/F/G paradigm), (6)
compare EMs’ and FBMs’ predictors (7) and more generally, compare all the previously
mentioned variables across two groups that are naturally formed (Curci et al., 2001; Tinti et
al., 2009).
4.2.1 Overview and hypotheses of the present study
The primary aim of this study was to contribute to the ongoing effort to empirically
examine the evolution of FBMs (Kvavilashvili et al., 2009; Schmolck et al., 2000), and EMs
(Hirst et al., 2015) of public events over long periods of time, and more particularly, to
provide a direct test of the hypothesised differences between the two in terms of their
phenomenology, recollective experience, and underlying predictors (Tinti et al., 2014). To
address these goals, we investigated memories of the result of the UK referendum on EU
membership. The referendum took place on 23 June 2016, and it resulted in a majority of
51.9% being in favour of leaving the EU, also known as ‘Brexit’. This event came as a shock
for British citizens, and for European ones more broadly. As well, because of the media
attention it attracted, and its consequentiality, this event embodied the characteristics to
trigger a FBM, as classically defined (Brown & Kulik, 1977). In light of this reason, we
addressed our study to British citizens in first place. Then, to further compare the effect of
latent variables such as importance-consequentiality and emotional intensity, and their effect
on FBM’s and EMs’ phenomenology, we chose a national group that had yet been affected
by the event, though not as much as the above described one: Italian citizens.
The procedure we adopted was the same across the two groups of respondents, who
completed the first questionnaire a few days after he event, and two re-tests – 11 and 23
months after it. The questionnaire was developed according to three levels of investigation:
first, we measured FBMs’ ‘live quality’ (Brown & Kulik, 1977) in terms of a mental image of
the reception context, and thus, after investigating its presence throughout a dichotomous
question and a short free recall (Conway et al., 1994), we assessed the degrees of vividness
and confidence in which it was recalled. Then, we measured FBM’s contents through the
canonical attributes of source, place, activity, others present, and aftermath, (Brown &
Kulik, 1977), and EM’s contents along five questions entailing the recall of factual details of
the event. For each FBM’s and EM’s content, we provided participants of a R/K/F/G
paradigm. Finally, we investigated the phenomenology and the effect of seven putative
predictors of EMs and FBMs: importance-consequentiality, emotional intensity, emotional
valence, surprise, rehearsal of the event, rehearsal of the personal circumstances, and
rehearsal via media exposure (Hirst et al., 2009, 2015; Tinti et al., 2014).
We formulated different specific hypotheses. First, we expect the event to be
experienced as highly important-consequential, surprising, and emotionally intense; and
participants to have followed the development of the event on media coverage, and rehearsed
the facts of the event and the circumstances in which they learned about it quite frequently.
However, we predict greater ratings among English participants at all variables, because of
their greater proximity to and social involvement in the event (Berntsen, 2018; Curci et al.,
2001; Tinti et al., 2009). Second, we expect participants to be able to recall a mental image of
the reception context at all tests, and to observe high and stable levels of vividness and
confidence, (Kvavilashvili et al., 2009; Neisser et al., 1996; Talarico & Rubin, 2003)
especially among English respondents. Third, in order to address the heterogeneous previous
findings pertaining to EMs’ accuracy and FBMs’ consistency, we track their trajectory over
time. More specifically, concerning FBMs’ consistency, we test whether it remains stable
over the two re-tests (Coluccia et al., 2010; Tekcan et al., 2003), decreases over the two re-
tests (Curci et al., 2001), or stabilizes between the first and the second re-tests (Hirst et al.,
2015). Concerning EMs’ accuracy, we test whether it remains stable over the three tests
(Coluccia et al., 2010), decreases over the three tests (Tinti et al., 2009), or is corrected
between the second and third re-tests (Hirst et al., 2015). In general, because of their greater
involvement, we predict to observe greater FBMs’ consistency and EMs’ accuracy among
English participants (Curci et al., 2001; Tinti et al., 2009). Fourth, as pertaining to the
R/K/F/G distribution, we hypothesise that ‘Remember’ judgments will be greater among
FBMs (and among English participants), as they reflect an episodic-like recall of one’s
personal circumstances; while ‘Know’ judgments will be greater among EMs (and among
English participants) as reflecting a semantic-like knowledge of the event (Tulving, 1985).
Finally, we advance a number of hypotheses to extend previous research distinguishing
FBMs’ and EMs’ predictors. We expect FBMs’ consistency to be predicted by the initial
appraisal of importance-consequentiality, emotional intensity, and the subsequent rehearsal of
the reception context via speaking and thinking (Finkenauer et al., 1998; Tinti et al., 2014);
conversely, we expect EMs’ accuracy to be predicted by the subsequent rehearsal of the event
via speaking and thinking, and media exposure.
4.3 Study 3: The EU referendum on UK membership
4.3.1 Material and methods
4.3.1.1 Participants and procedure
Participants belonged to an initial pool counting 906 respondents (UK, n = 429; Italy,
n = 477 Italians). Of them, a total of 405 individuals volunteered to take part to the three
phases of the study (UK, n = 210; Italy, n = 195), constituting the final sample of the present
study. The 74% of English participants were women; at T1, their age ranged between 18 and
72 years, M = 37.89, SD = 12.58. Within the Italian group, 67% of participants were women;
and at T1, their age ranged between 18 and 70 years, M = 44.10, SD = 12.38. Participants
were recruited among undergraduate psychology students, researchers and staff from the
Department of Psychology at University of Turin and City, University of London, and
experimenters’ acquaintances. 94% of English participants and 88% of Italian participants
expressed a preference for the ‘remain’ party.
The time-lapse between the initial assessment (T1) and the first re-test (T2) was
chosen consistently with other studies investigating FBMs and EMs of public events (e.g.,
Coluccia et al., 2010; Tekcan et al., 2003), while the interval between the first assessment and
the second re-test (T3) was chosen to achieve the highest comparison with studies
investigating FBMs (e.g., Kvavilashvili, Mirani, Schlagman, Foley, & Kornbrot, 2009;
Neisser & Harsch, 1992; Schmolck et al., 2000) and EMs (Hirst et al., 2009, 2015) across
large periods of time. Moreover, the two re-tests were a-priori decided not to temporally
overlap with the anniversary of the event, in order to avoid biases due to an increase of media
attention (Conway, Skitka, Hemmerich, & Kershaw, 2009; Hirst et al., 2009). Hence, all
participants completed the T1 between 6 and 46 days after the outcome of the referendum
was announced on 24th June 2016 (M = 15.72, SD = 9.32). Then, they completed the T2
between May 8th and June 8th 2017, i.e., 11 – 12 months after the event; and finally, the T3
between March 5th and April 16th 2018, i.e., 23 – 24 months after the event. Italian and
English respondents respectively completed the surveys in Italian and English via the online
platform ‘Qualtrics’. The questionnaire was composed in English, then translated into Italian
by the first author (Italian native speaker), and reviewed by an additional native speaker. All
participants read and accepted the informative consent at all phases.
4.3.1.2 Measures
The questionnaire was created to investigate FBMs’ and EMs’ contents and their
respective predictors by adapting instruments of previous research (Conway et al., 1994;
Finkenauer et al., 1998; Tinti et al., 2014). The questionnaire started with a brief introduction
of the study: participants were thanked for taking part, they were informed that the study
focused on their memories, opinions, and emotions toward Brexit, and that it consisted of
three stages assessed over three different time points. On the following page, participants
were told that they would have been asked to recall some details about the context in which
they first learned the news, and some details about the news itself, and that for each
information they provided they had to indicate whether they remembered, knew, felt familiar,
or guessed their answer. More in detail, instructions (adapted from Stone, Luminet, &
Takahashi, 2015; Williams, Conway, & Moulin, 2013) were as follow: a ‘remember (R)’
response would be given when the information you recall has with it images or feelings.
Perhaps you virtually ‘hear’ or ‘see’ the recalled detail again, feel again (even if not as
intensely) as you did when you first learned the news; a ‘just know (K)’ response would be
made when you do not remember (as in the above definition) but you simply just know that
the information you have recalled is of some aspect of the original experience; a ‘feels
familiar (F)’ response would be mad when you neither remember nor just know (as in the
above definitions) but nevertheless the information you have brought to mind feels familiar,
as it has something to do with the original experience; a ‘guess (G)’ response would be made
when none of the above apply, and you really are making a guess.
Successively, we assessed the following sets of items5: (1) presence of a mental image of
the reception context, (2) mental image’s vividness and confidence, (3) FBM, (4) R/K/F/G
assessment for each FBM’s attribute, (5) EM, (6) R/K/F/G assessment for each EM’s
question, (7) importance-consequentiality, (8) surprise, (9) emotional valence and intensity,
(10) event memory rehearsal, (11) flashbulb memory rehearsal, (12) rehearsal via media
exposure. Except from items’ sets (10) and (11) that were assessed only at T2 and T3, and
items’ set (12) which was assessed only at T1, all sets of items were assessed at all phases.
5 In the questionnaire, items’ sets were listed in this order: (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (12),
(10), (11), (8), (9).
Mental image. Participants were asked whether they could picture in mind one or
several images of the moment in which they first learned about the result of the referendum
(Pillemer, 1984). Participants who responded ‘yes’ were directed to the next three items (i.e.,
free recall, vividness, and confidence), while participants who responded ‘no’ skipped that
part. Thus, in the free recall task, participants were asked to write a description of the image
or images they had in mind. The contents of the free recall will not be further discussed, as
we used it as a cue for the assessment of vividness and confidence.
Mental image’s vividness and confidence. Participants were asked to rate the
vividness of the image or images they had in mind on a scale ranging from 1 (= very unclear)
to 5 (= very vivid), and the extent to which they were confident about their recall (1 = not
confident at all, 5 = very confident). In order to gather vividness’ and confidence’s tendency
over time in case mental image was later reconstructed or forgotten, for the following
analyses, we assigned a score of 0 to participants who did not have a mental image, meaning
‘absence of vividness/confidence’.
Flashbulb memory. We assessed five attributes of the reception context: the
‘source’ of news; the ‘place’ participants were when they first learned the news; the ‘activity’
they were engaged with; ‘others’ they were with; and what they did in the immediate
‘aftermath’ of learning the news. For each answer they provided, participants were
encouraged to give as much detail as possible, or to pick the ‘I don’t remember’ option
whenever they were unable to recall an information. All questions were presented in an open-
ended format, except from ‘source’, for which we used a different one. Participants were first
asked whether they had learned about the news from a person: if they answered ‘yes’, they
were asked to type the name and the relation they had with this person (e.g., a friend, a
relative, a colleague), while if they answered ‘no’, they were asked whether they learned it
through the media, and, thus, were further presented of a list of options (i.e., online streaming
of the count, online newspapers, social networks, radio, TV, printed newspapers) and an
additional space where they could type any ‘other’ sources of news. This procedure was
preferred in order to achieve a stronger homogeneity during the scoring of the contents.
R/K/F/G assessment for each flashbulb memory attribute. After the assessment of
each attribute, participants were asked to indicate whether they remembered, knew, felt
familiar, or just guessed the information they provided above. This question was not
displayed when participants selected the ‘I don’t remember’ option (thus, these answers were
scored as ‘0’).
Event memory. EM was assessed through five questions: two of them implied the
recall of one information, and three of them required the recall of two information. More in
detail, participants were asked to report: the percentage of people who voted for the UK to
leave the EU (% Leave); the name of two cities that voted for the UK to leave the EU (cities
Leave); the name of two cities that voted for the UK to remain in the EU (cities Remain); the
exact day and month (date) and the exact day of the week in which the referendum took place
(day of week). Among all questions, we provided a ‘I don’t know/I don’t remember’ option.
All questions were presented in an open-ended format, except from ‘date’ and ‘day of week’
in which we used a multiple choice format where a complete range of the possible answers
was provided.
R/K/F/G assessment for each event memory attribute. The procedure was the same of
the one we adopted for each FBM attribute.
Importance-consequentiality. Participants rated the extent to which the event was
important (a) for themselves personally and (b) for their country on 5-points scales (1 = not at
all important; 5 = very important). On 5-points scales (1 = not at all; 5 = a lot), they also
rated the extent to which the event could have consequences (c) for their personal life and (d)
for their country. The four items were combined into a mean score, T1, α = .72; T2, α = .67;
T3, α = .72.
Surprise. At T1, surprise was assessed on a single item in which we asked
participants to rate the extent to which they were surprised about the outcome of the
referendum on a 5-points scale (1 = not at all; 5 = a lot). Along the same scale, at T2 and T3,
participants were asked to rate the extent to which they were ‘still now’ surprised about the
outcome of the referendum.
Emotional valence and intensity. Participants were asked to rate on two 5-points
scale the extent to which (a) their emotional reaction was negative (1 = very negative) or
positive (5 = very positive), and (b) intense (1 = not intense at all; 5 = very intense).
Event memory rehearsal. At T2 and T3, participants rated the extent to which they had
respectively thought and spoken with others about the event on two separate 5-points scales
(1 = never; 5 = very frequently). The two items were collapsed into a mean score, T2, α = .90;
T3, α = .89.
Flashbulb memory rehearsal. At T2 and T3, participants rated the extent to which
they had respectively thought and spoken with others about the personal circumstances in
which they learned about the news (i.e., their FBM) on two separate 5-points scales (1 =
never; 5 = very frequently). The two items were collapsed into a mean score, T2, α = .78; T3,
α = .79.
Rehearsal via media exposure. At T1, participants rated the extent to which
they had followed the event on the media in its immediate aftermath and the extent to which
they had actively looked for updates. The two questions were assessed among two separate 5-
points scales (1 = never; 5 = very frequently) and were later combined into a mean score, α =
.69.
4.3.1.3 Scoring of qualitative contents.
Contents pertaining to FBM and EM were first scored according to their presence
respectively at T1, T2, and T3 (Curci et al., 2001). In both cases, a score of 1 was assigned
whenever participants could provide an information at each single test, regardless of its
consistency or accuracy; while a score of 0 was assigned when participants failed to provide
an information, i.e., they chose the option ‘I don’t know/I don’t remember’. Scores were
summed up into a ‘combined presence score’ (CPS) ranging from 0 to 5 (CPS_FBM: T1, α =
.69; T2, α = .73; T3, α = .82; CPS_EM: T1, α = .65; T2, α = .80; T3, α = .84).
Then, FBMs’ contents were separately scored at T2 and T3 according to their
consistency with the information provided at T1. In addition to that, to test whether FBMs’
contents stabilised after a year (Hirst et al., 2009), we also scored the consistency between
responses at T3 and those at T2 (Tekcan et al., 2003). Overall, we adopted a 3 points-scale
scoring procedure (Curci & Luminet, 2006), according to which a score of 0 was assigned
either when the two answers were different in their contents, or when an information was
missing in one or both time points; a score of 1 was awarded when the answer at re-test was
partially consistent with the information provided at the previous test, e.g., it was not as
detailed as the initial information provided; and a score of 2 was awarded when the answer at
re-test contained the same information previously provided, both in terms of its content and
specificity. Then, the scores awarded to each category were summed up into a ‘Combined
Consistency Score’ (CCS) that ranged from 0 to 10 (T1 – T2, α = .74; T1 – T3; α = .73; T2 –
T3, α = .72).
EMs’ contents were separately scored at T1, T2, and T3 according to their accuracy.
We used a three-points scale (0 = incorrect or missing, 1 = partially correct, 2 = correct) and
summed up all scores into a ‘Combined Accuracy Score’ (CAS) that could range from 0 to
10 (T1, α = .75; T2, α = .81; T3, α = .79).
A detailed description of the coding scheme that we developed for scoring FBMs’ and
EMs’ contents is provided in the supplementary materials (Appendix A).
4.3.1.4 Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses comprise two sections. The first section entails a set of descriptive
statistics and between subjects repeated measures ANOVAs to investigate (a) the effect of
time and country on mental image’s vividness and confidence; (b) the effect of time, country,
and memory type (FBM vs. EM) on Combined Presence Scores (CPS); (c) the effect of time
and country on FBMs’ Combined Consistency Scores (CCS); (d) the effect of time and
country on EMs’ Combined Accuracy Score (CAS); (e) the effect of time, country, and
memory type on R/K/F/G distribution; (f) the effect of time and country on FBMs’ and EMs’
putative predictors. The second section comprehends a set of regression analyses aimed to
compare the effect of seven putative predictors on FBMs’ consistency and EMs’ accuracy.
4.3.2 Results
4.3.2.1 Descriptive statistics and repeated measure ANOVAs.
Mental image
At T1, overall 86.2% of participants (97.6% among the UK group, and 73.8% in the
Italian group) reported to carry in mind an image or several images about the context in
which they first learned the news. The frequency of ‘mental image-holders’ decreased at T2
(Overall, 79.8%; UK, 89%; Italy, 69.7%) and levelled off at T3 (Overall, 76.5%; UK, 85%;
confidence ratings for each country among the three tests. Importantly, means are calculated
for all participants, as a score of ‘0’ was attributed to those who reported not to have a mental
image.

At a descriptive level, English participants scored higher than Italian ones both in
vividness and confidence ratings among the three tests. Regardless of the country, both
vividness and confidence ratings decreased from T1 to T2, and stabilised between T2 and T3.
To statistically assess the effects of time, country, and their interaction, we performed a x 3
(T1 vs. T2 vs. T3) x 2 (England vs. Italy) repeated measure ANOVA on confidence and
vividness ratings. Results revealed a main effect of country, F (2, 402) = 41.66, p < .001, n 2

and country was not significant, F (4, 400) = 41.66, p = .611, n 2 = .007. The effects on

Presence of Flashbulb memory and Event memory
To gather an overall measure of the amount of information participants reported at
each test, regardless of consistency or accuracy, we scored FBMs’ attribute and EMs’
report each FBMs’ attribute among the three time points. As we can observe, English
respondents could report an information about their reception context for the vast majority of
the assessed attributes, whereas the incidence of Italian participants who reported all
information was high at T1, but decreased over time.

To have a more general frame, we summed up all FBMs’ attributes into a ‘Combined

observe, overall, English participants provided an answer to all questions, with the exception
of ‘cities that voted for Leave’, for which the percentage of participants was below 85% at all
tests. The incidence of Italian participants reporting an answer was lower: the highest rates
were observed for ‘date’ and ‘day of the week’ at T1, although the two dropped over time.
Notably, participants were more able to report the name of the cities that voted Remain,
rather than those which voted for Leave, regardless of the country.

To observe the overall picture on a descriptive level, we summed up all answers to

At a descriptive level, English participants’ consistency was largely above the mean
point for all the attributes at all three time lags, expect from ‘aftermath’, which resulted to be
the least consistent attribute. Italian participants were overall less consistent than English
ones: when comparing T1 – T2 and T1 – T3, consistency scores were slightly above the mean
for ‘source’, ‘place’, and ‘activity’, whereas comparing T2 – T3, consistency was above the
mean among all attributes except from ‘aftermath’. To gather a more global overview of
FBM’s consistency, we summed up the scores of all the investigated attributes into a global
index of ‘Combined Consistency Score (CCS)’, ranging from 0 to 10. Among English
participants, CCS was above the mean point at all tests: more in detail, when comparing the
three time lags, mean scores were lower between T1 – T3 than between T1 – T2, but they
were higher between T2 – T3. Among Italian participants, CCS was under the mean point
between T1 – T2 and T1 – T3, although it increased both between these two time lags, and
again between T2 – T3, reaching scores above the mean point.
Next, in order to statistically assess the effect of time, country, and their interaction,
we performed a 3 (T1 – T2 vs. T1 – T3 vs. T2 – T3) X 2 (England vs. Italy) repeated
4. Results revealed a main effect of time, F (2, 402) = 15.67, p < .001, n 2 = .072, reflecting
that overall participants were more consistent between T2 – T3 than between T1 – T2 and T1
– T3. This trend was confirmed by a pairwise comparison which showed that the difference
on FBM consistency between time lags T1 – T2 and T1 – T3 was not significant, while the
difference between time lags T1 – T2 and T2 – T3 was significant, as well as the difference
between time lags T1 – T3 and T2 – T3, reflecting that participants were less consistent
between T1 – T2 and T1 – T3 than between T2 – T3. Pairwise comparisons on the effect of
country, F (1, 403) = 104.88, p < .001, n 2 = .207, indicated that British respondents were
more consistent than Italian ones. Finally, there was no significant interaction between time
and country, F (2, 402) = 2.07, p = .127, n 2 = .010.
Taken together, all the above reported results head in the same direction: the presence
and consistency of FBMs are higher within retests than between initial test and retests.

Overall, at a descriptive level, English participants were more accurate than Italian
participants in recalling the details of the original event. More specifically, at T1, English
participants’ accuracy was amply above the mean among all questions, while Italian
participants’ ratings were above the mean points only for the ‘date’ and the ‘day of the week’
in which the referendum was held. Both at T2 and T3, English participants were moderately
accurate in all questions except from the ones pertaining to the list of cities that voted Leave
(at T2 and T3) and the ‘day of the week’ (at T3), while Italian participants’ level of accuracy
was under the mean point among all questions both at T2 and T3. As well, the ‘Combined
Accuracy Score, CAS’ (i.e., the sum of all accuracy scores) indicated a general decrease of
EM’s accuracy among time, regardless of the country. To test this trend and the differences
between the two countries, we performed a 3 (T1 vs. T2 vs. T3) X 2 (England vs. Italy)
effect. Results revealed a main effect of time, F (2, 402) = 296.80, p < .001, n 2 = .596,

R/K/F/G distribution among flashbulb memory and event memory.
One of the aims of this study was to investigate FBMs’ and EMs’ recollective
characteristics. To do so, we adopted a R/K/F/G paradigm, by aim of which, at the end of
each attribute/question, we asked participants whether they ‘Remembered’, ‘Knew’, felt
‘Familiar’ with, or ‘Guessed’ the information they provided. We counted the frequency of
each judgment among the information participants provided at each test for FBMs’ attributes
and EMs’ questions. Thus, we gained a measure of R/K/F/G distribution that could range
from 0 to 5, as the number of the attributes and questions we assessed. Next, in order to
gather the effect of time, country, and memory type on the distribution of R/K/F/G
judgments, we used a repeated measure ANOVA with time (T1 vs. T2 vs. T3) as within
subject variables and country (UK vs. Italy) and memory type (FBM vs. EM) as between
subject variables. All main effects, interactions, and the significant effects on a univariate
memory type on R/K/F/G distribution.

reported more ‘Remember’, ‘Know’, and ‘Guess’ judgments than Italian participants, which
in turn reported more ‘Familiar’ judgments. The effect of memory type was significant for
‘Remember’, ‘Know’, ‘Familiar’, and ‘Guess’ judgments, indicating a greater prevalence of
‘Remember’ judgments among FBM’s attributes, and a greater prevalence of ‘Know’,
‘Familiar’, and ‘Guess’ judgments, among EM’s answers. The interaction between memory
type and country was significant among ‘Know’ judgments, reflecting that there were no
differences between UK and Italy among FBM’s attributes, while the UK group reported
more ‘Know’ judgments than the Italian one among event memory’s answers. The interaction
between memory type and time was significant among ‘Remember’, and ‘Guess’ judgments,
indicating that the distribution of ‘Remember’ judgments decreased over time among FBM’s
attributes but not among EMs’ answers; and that the distribution of ‘Guess’ judgments
remained stable among FBMs’ attributes while it increased among EMs’ answers. The
interaction between country and time was not significant among all judgments. Finally, as

‘Remember’ judgments pertaining to FBMs’ attributes were stable among time within the

On a descriptive level, among all tests, English participants appraised the event as
more important and consequential, they were more surprised about the news, and their
emotional valence was more negative, and more intense than Italian participants. Among the
variables that we assessed only at retests, we can observe that English participants rehearsed
the facts of the event and the circumstances in which they learned about it more frequently
than Italian participants. Finally, among the variables we assessed at initial test only, it
emerged that English participants rehearsed the event more frequently via media exposure
than Italian participants. To investigate the effect of time, country, and their interaction, we
performed a 2 (UK vs. Italy) X 3 (T1 vs. T2 vs. T3) repeated measures ANOVA on the
variables we assessed at all tests (i.e., importance-consequentiality, surprise, emotional
valence, and emotional intensity); a 2 (UK vs. Italy) X 2 (T2 vs. T3) repeated measures
ANOVA on the variables we assessed only at re-tests (i.e., rehearsal of the event and
rehearsal of FBM); and a one-way ANOVA on the variable we assessed only at the first test
(i.e., rehearsal of the event via media coverage). Overall, results showed a main effect of
and its effect on a univariate level along each predictor, together with EMMs.

Throughout the three tests, English participants had higher scores for importance-

throughout the two re-tests, they rehearsed the event and its related learning circumstances
more than Italian participants, and, at the first assessment, they followed the development of

As we can observe, the interaction was significant for importance-consequentiality, and
emotional intensity. EMMs showed that importance-consequentiality was stable over time among
English participants, while it decreased over time among Italian participants. Regarding emotional
intensity, ratings within English participants had a stronger decrease between T1 and T2 than within
Italian participants. Regarding the variables that we investigated at re-tests, the interaction was
significant for FBM’s rehearsal only, reflecting that English participants rehearsed FBM more at T2
than at T3, while rehearsal among Italian participants remained low both at T2 and T3.
4.3.2.2 Regression analyses
In the following set of analyses, we investigated the effect of seven putative predictors on
FBM’s consistency and EM’s accuracy: importance-consequentiality, surprise, emotional intensity,
emotional valence, rehearsal of the personal circumstances, rehearsal of the event, and rehearsal via
material. We considered the sample as a whole for two reasons: first, there is evidence that the
underlying processes leading to FBMs’ and EMs’ formation apply much in the same way regardless
of the proximity to the event (Tinti et al., 2009); second, the effect of the group should, in turn,
reflect in the effect of the different predictors (Conway et al., 1994). However, we tested whether
country moderated the effect of each predictor on FBMs’ consistency at each time-lag and EMs’
accuracy at each time point, and we found no significant effect.
Thus, to determine the effect of each possible predictor, we computed different hierarchical
regression analyses with FBM’s consistency (at T1 – T2, T1 – T3, and T2 – T3) and EM’s accuracy
(at T1, T2, and T3) as dependent variables. Predictors were entered in two stages: first, the variables
at T1 (i.e., importance-consequentiality, emotional reaction, emotional valence, and rehearsal via
media exposure), and then, the variables at T2 and T3 (i.e., event memory’s and FBM’s rehearsal).

Overall, results revealed that the predictors we entered significantly contributed to the
regression model to explain FBMs’ consistency at each time lag. More in detail, we found
that the strongest predictor across all time lags was the initial appraisal of importance-
consequentiality. Rehearsal via media exposure significantly predicted FBMs’ consistency at
T1 – T2’s and T1 – T2 time lags, but not at T2 – T3’s one. The rehearsal of event memory
had a significant impact in particular at T3, contributing to explain FBM’s consistency at
time lags T1 – T3 and T2 – T3; whereas FBMs’ recall at T2 was better predicted by the
rehearsal of the personal circumstances at T2. This result reflects what we previously
observed on a descriptive level: while at T2 participants frequently rehearsed the event and
their personal circumstances, at T3 they tended to rehearse the details of the event more
frequently rather than the circumstances in which they learned about it. Finally, nor
emotional intensity or valence at initial test predicted FBMs’ recall at any time lags.
Regarding EMs’ accuracy, results revealed that the predictors we entered significantly
contributed to the regression model at each time point. The variable that best predicted EMs’
accuracy among all time points was the initial rehearsal via media exposure; whereas the
subsequent rehearsal of EM at re-test significantly predicted the accuracy at T2 and T3.
Moreover, there was a significant effect of importance-consequentiality to predict EMs’
accuracy at T1 and T3, though not at T2. Finally, there was no effect of emotional valence at
none of the three time points, while emotional intensity significantly predicted EMs’
accuracy only at T1.
4.4 Discussion
In this study, we explored the long-term evolution of FBMs and EMs. We
investigated the phenomenology, recollective experience, and the factors associated with
FBMs’ and EMs’ recall of the UK referendum on EU membership across two national groups
of English and Italian citizens that differed for their proximity to and importance-
consequentiality of the event. We used a test-retest methodology entailing long delay periods
of 11- and 23-months to track the consistency, vividness, and confidence of FBMs, and the
accuracy of EMs. In addition, we used a R/K/F/G paradigm to assess the recollective
experiences of the two. Finally, we investigated the effect of seven putative predictors:
importance-consequentiality, surprise, emotional valence, emotional intensity, rehearsal of
the event via speaking and thinking, rehearsal of the event via media exposure, and rehearsal
of the personal circumstances in which the news was learned.
Previous research has suggested that FBMs and EMs might rely on different memory
systems (Pezdek, 2003; Tinti et al., 2014), and that their trajectories over time are shaped by
individuals’ appraisals and proximity toward the event (Curci et al., 2001; Er, 2003; Pezdek,
2003). However, few empirical studies have assessed how the retention of the two differs
over long periods of time (Coluccia et al., 2010; Curci et al., 2001; Tekcan et al., 2003), and
what factors impact their recall (Hirst et al., 2009, 2015). Most notably, these studies have
reported contrasting results, making it difficult to draw a heterogeneous frame on the nature
of these memories. This study represents an attempt to address this issue and a number of
questions in current autobiographical memory research: (1) how appraisals and emotion can
account for the long-term memories’ retention and national group differences; (2) how FBMs
and EMs evolve over long-term periods; (3) how the recollective experience of the two
comes about; (4) and what factors shape the long-term recall of FBMs and EMs respectively.
4.4.1 Appraisals, emotion, and flashbulb memories in social groups
This study showed that English respondents appraised the event as more important-
consequential than Italian ones. As well, English respondents reported stronger intensity of
emotion and surprise; followed the news on media coverage and engaged in rehearsal of the
event and the circumstances in which they learned about it more often than Italian ones. We
found no differences on the emotional valence, indicating that the event was experienced as
highly negative across both groups. Importance-consequentiality, surprise, emotional
intensity, and rehearsal of the event generally decreased over time; while emotional valence
and rehearsal of the circumstances in which the event was learned remained stable. However,
an interaction effect of group by time revealed that importance-consequentiality and
emotional intensity remained stable over time across the UK group, while they decreased
across the Italian one. This interaction also revealed that the rehearsal of the circumstances of
learning the news decreased over time across the UK group but remained stably low across
the Italian one. Concerning the retention of FBMs and EMs, and the vividness and
confidence associated to the mental image of the news’ reception context, results showed that
English participants retained more consistent FBMs and more accurate EMs, and reported to
have a more vivid mental image which they were more confident about compared to their
Italian counterparts.
The effect of time on FBMs’ and EMs’ recall will be discussed in the next section, as
here we will mainly focus on the interaction between group and time. This interaction was
found exclusively across EMs’ accuracy, indicating a slight decrease among English
participants over the three tests; while among Italian participants, EMs’ accuracy strongly
decreased from the first to the second test, and stabilized at the third one. Importantly, this
effect must be interpreted in light of the two groups’ mean scores: although EMs’ accuracy
among English participants endured a decline over time, ratings remained yet high; whereas
EMs’ accuracy among Italian participants did not show a decline between the first and
second re-test as ratings were already extremely low. Most importantly, it must be noted that
the nature of the event required a fine knowledge of the UK’s territory to develop an accurate
memory of the event. Indeed, many details concerning the event were related to the recall of
diverse English cities, and this might have represented an advantage for English participants.
Finally, no interaction of group by time was observed for FBMs’ consistency, their vividness,
and the relative confidence ratings.
These results confirm previous findings on FBMs across social groups arguing that
greater involvement and proximity in the event is generally associated with greater appraised
importance-consequentiality and intensity of emotion (Finkenauer et al., 1998; Tinti et al.,
2009), which in turn facilitate FBMs’ consistency (Conway et al., 1994; Luminet & Curci,
2009; Stone et al., 2015) and EMs’ accuracy (Larsen, 1992; Pezdek, 2003). As well, they
corroborate the hypothesis that the trajectory of vividness and confidence over time is
independent from the event’s proximity (Neisser et al., 1996), contributing to the claim that
vividness and confidence would be FBMs’ defining features. For example, Neisser et al.
(1996) investigated FBMs of the Loma Prieta earthquake in three groups that differed for
their proximity to the event, and they found that FBMs’ confidence ratings were particularly
high in all groups, regardless of their proximity to the event. Similarly, Tinti et al. (2009)
observed that vividness ratings among FBMs of the death of Pope John Paul II were yet
higher and more stable among participants who were more concerned about his death (i.e.,
Polish ones), but that the decline over time in the other two groups (i.e., Swiss and Italian
participants) was not strong. Overall, the findings presented in this study enhance further
understanding regarding the role of cognitive appraisals in the formation of autobiographical
memories.
4.4.2 The long-term evolution of flashbulb and event memories
One of the chief aims of this study was to investigate the effect of time on FBMs’ and
EMs’ long-term retention. We measured participants’ recalls at three separate time points –
two weeks (T1), one year (T2), and two years after the event (T3). Results showed that
FBMs’ consistency remained stable from the first (T1 – T2) to the second year (T1 – T3), but
most importantly, that the consistency between the two re-tests (T2 – T3) was greater than
the consistency observed at the first and second year. On the other hand, EMs’ accuracy
linearly decreased over the first and second year.
Schmolck and colleagues (2000) pointed out that the use of short retention times
might be associated to higher memory consistency and subsequent improper conclusions on
the long-lasting consistency of FBMs. For this reason, we used a one-year interval between
the first assessment and the first re-test and a two-years interval between the first assessment
and the second re-test. Together with the use of a within-subject design, this can be
considered a strength of the present study. This also implies that the design we adopted
makes our findings comparable to the ones highlighted in previous research (Coluccia et al.,
2010; Conway et al., 2009; Hirst et al., 2009; Kvavilashvili et al., 2009; Rimmele et al., 2012;
Tekcan et al., 2003), and allows us to assess the stability of recalls over and beyond the first
assessment. The fact that FBM’s consistency remains high between the first and the second
year calls into question several studies arguing that FBMs share the same destiny as ordinary
memories (Curci et al., 2001; Rimmele et al., 2012; Schmolck et al., 2000), and rather
support the claims concerning their unusual stability (Coluccia et al., 2010; Tekcan et al.,
2003). Nevertheless, the most striking result emerging from this study is that FBMs’
consistency is at its greatest peak between the two re-tests (T2 to T3). This finding is partially
in line with previous studies investigating FBMs over long-term periods, and showing that
memories’ inconsistencies are repeated after the first re-test (Hirst et al., 2015). However, our
results suggest a slightly different interpretation: not only FBMs were consistent between the
first and the second year, but also, a number of details were added at the first year, and
maintained consistently over the second one. Importantly, our findings show that, more than
repeating inconsistencies, participants tended to add new details to the memory they
retrieved, and to retain them consistently over time. This frame is particularly compelling to
the understanding of autobiographical memory retrieval over long-term periods, and it
supports and extends the view that these memories carry reconstructive features.
In this study, we also investigated the accuracy of EMs over time. EM relates to the
objective recall of the facts of the event; that in this study matched with a number of
information regarding the date in which the referendum was held, the cities that voted for
‘Leave’ or ‘Remain’, and similar pieces of information. Importantly, not all public events
allow a clear distinction between EMs and FBMs, as in some of them the circumstances of
the event coincide with the event itself – for example, the Marmara earthquake in Turkey (Er,
2003) or the 9/11 terrorist attack in New York (Pezdek, 2003), in which participants were as
well victims or bystanders of the event. The event we studied enabled us to distinguish the
two, and to address important questions about whether their recall might differ over time.
Memory researchers have long been debating whether EM belongs to FBM – and therefore
facilitates its recall (Finkenauer et al., 1998) – or whether the two rely to different and
independent memory systems, with different antecedents and phenomenological
characteristics (Tinti et al., 2014). Results of this study revealed that the accuracy of EMs
linearly decreased over time independently from FBMs, which remained rather stable. This
result supports previous findings (Tinti et al., 2009) showing EMs’ decline, and highlights the
hypothesis that information that is not autobiographical endures greater effect of time.
Memory of the circumstances involves a first person perspective of the event (Nigro &
Neisser, 1983), and its recall is the result of the intersection between the event and the
person’s unique and subjective experience of the event. Memory of the event, instead,
consists of an objective representation, and its recall does not (always) entail a subjective
experience, being it the same for everyone. Indeed, results of this study showed that memory
reconstructive processes have an effect on FBMs – which are boosted of new details over
time – but not on EMs, which are subject to forgetting and inconsistencies. This frame
explains why often times people are capable of recalling where they were, or what they were
doing while learning about past important events, without necessarily remembering much
about the event in itself.
4.4.3 The recollective experience of flashbulb and event memories
Another aim of this study was to explore FBMs’ and EMs’ recollective experiences.
Over the three tests, we used a R/K/F/G paradigm (Gardiner, Ramponi, & Richardson-
Klavehn, 1998; Williams et al., 2013) across each FBM’s and EM’s question. Results showed
that time (T1 vs. T2 vs. T3), group (UK vs. Italy), and memory type (FBM vs. EM) had a
significant effect on the distribution of R/K/F/G judgments. More in detail, the effect of time
revealed that ‘Remember (R)’ judgments decreased; ‘Know (K)’ remained stable; and
‘Familiar (F)’ and ‘Guess (G)’ increased over the three tests. The effect of group indicated
that English participants reported more R, K, and G judgments than Italian ones, which in
turn reported more F ones. Regarding the type of memory, the effect indicated that FBMs
were characterized by R judgments, while EMs where characterized by K, F, and G ones.
Overall, these results partially confirmed our initial hypotheses, meaning that, although we
expected R and K judgments to remain stable over time, our data indicated that R ones yet
endured the effect of time. This result may reflect the fact that some information reported at
the initial assessment with an R judgment might have been forgotten, or that they might have
been attributed to another recollective judgment. Consistent with this, results showed an
increase of F and G judgments. Concerning the effect of the group, results confirmed our
hypotheses according to which the greater involvement of English participants was associated
with greater prevalence of R and K judgments. Interestingly, English participants also
reported more G judgments than Italian ones, probably reflecting the fact that the former yet
attempted to provide an answer regardless of its accuracy, compared to the latter, who did not
attempt to provide one at all. On the other hand, Italian participants made a predominant use
of F judgments, possibly indicating not a total absence of confidence of recall.
The most important result, however, is the one related to the prevalence of R
judgments among FBMs’ attributes and K, F, G among EMs’ answers. This result confirms
our initial hypothesis, and nicely integrates the framework we previously highlighted upon
the differences between FBMs and EMs. In fact, the presence of R judgments in the
subsequent recall of FBMs is consistent with the idea that autobiographical information is
recollected with greater sense of ‘subjective time’ and autonoetic consciousness. On the
contrary, the presence of K judgments among EMs’ recalls reflects an ‘objective-semantic
knowledge’ and a noetic consciousness of the event (Tulving, 1985). Most interestingly, there
was a significant interaction of memory type by country and memory type by time. The first
effect indicated that the distribution of K judgments did not differ between English and
Italian participants among FBMs’ attributes, while it was greater among English than Italian
participants among EMs’ answers. This result indicates that K judgments are greater among
those participants who reported higher EMs’ accuracy, and suggests that information that are
not autobiographical are retrieved with a sense of ‘objective knowledge’ especially when
they are more accurate. The interaction between memory type and time was significant for R
judgments, showing a decrease among FBMs but not EMs, and G judgments, showing a
decrease among EMs but not FBMs.
Taken together, these results lead the way to a greater understanding of FBMs’ and
EMs’ phenomenology. In fact, only a few studies have adopted the R/K paradigm to study
these memories (e.g., Rimmele et al., 2012) and, to our knowledge, no others have made use
of the R/K/F/G paradigm to investigate the recollective experiences as separate processes.
Scholars have indeed mostly used this paradigm to assess the degree of participants’
confidence upon their retrieved memories, and conceptualized the R/K/F/G judgments along
a continuum (Stone et al., 2015), ranging from low to high confidence. The novel aspect of
this study lies in the use of this paradigm as reflecting independent entities: ‘Remember’ and
‘Know’ as suggesting an episodic and semantic recall respectively, and ‘Familiar’ and
‘Guess’ answers as reflecting lower memory accuracy.
4.4.4 Factors associated with flashbulb memories’ consistency and event
memories’ accuracy
In this study, we showed that different factors predicted FBMs’ and EMs’ long-term
retention. We computed a series of regression analyses on FBMs’ consistency among three
time lags (T1 – T2, T1 – T3, and T2 – T3) and EMs’ accuracy among each time point (T1,
T2, and T3) by focusing on seven predictors: importance-consequentiality, surprise,
emotional valence, emotional intensity, rehearsal of the event via speaking and thinking,
rehearsal of the event via media exposure, and rehearsal of the personal circumstances in
which the news was learned. We computed the analyses on the whole sample, as first we
hypothesized that the differences between English and Italian participants would reflect in the
intensity of emotion and appraisal of importance-consequentiality. In addition, in line with
this idea, country did not moderate the effect of the predictors on FBMs’ and EMs’ recall.
Results indicated that FBMs’ consistency was predicted by initial importance-
consequentiality at each time lag, while EMs’ accuracy was predicted by the subsequent
rehearsal of the event via media exposure at each time point. However, further differences
were observed on the effect of other predictors among each time lag/time point. Rehearsal of
the event via media exposure predicted FBMs at T1 – T2 and T1 – T3 but not at T2 – T3.
Rehearsal of the event via speaking and thinking predicted FBMs at T1 – T3 and T2 – T3
(but not at T1 – T2), and EMs’ accuracy at both T2 and T3. Rehearsal of the circumstances
via speaking and thinking predicted FBMs only at T1 – T2. Furthermore, importance-
consequentiality also predicted EMs’ accuracy at T3 and T1, but not at T2. Finally, emotional
intensity only predicted EM’s accuracy at T1; while no effect of emotional valence and
surprise were found neither for FBMs’ consistency nor for EMs’ accuracy.
Results concerning rehearsal extend Tinti et al.’s (2014) findings upon the attempt to
disentangle different types of rehearsal – one related to the facts of the event, another related
to the personal circumstances of learning the news, and still another regarding the effect of
media coverage. However, since the authors did not provide a test of the hypothesized effect
of these rehearsal practices on longitudinal data, the present study addressed this gap
examining the effect of these factors on FBMs’ and EMs’ long-term retention. Results
confirmed the hypothesis that the rehearsal of the event and the rehearsal via media exposure
impacted on EMs’ recall, while the rehearsal of the circumstances impacted on FBMs’ recall.
However, this latter was true only across the first year, when the remembering of the
circumstances was still frequent in the individuals’ thoughts and conversations. On the
contrary, across the second year, rehearsal of the circumstances was less frequent, and
individuals might have been able to recuperate autobiographical information thanks to the
event in itself, which rehearsal was yet more salient. Indeed, it must be noted that the event
we investigated had received remarkable media coverage attention all over the two years that
have interested this research, as the development of the event was still ongoing and thus
extremely relevant for European citizens in general.
Results of this study also confirm previous findings pointing out that surprise is not a
necessary trigger of FBMs and EMs (Coluccia et al., 2010; Tinti et al., 2009), and it is in line
with previous research showing no long-term effect of initial intensity of emotion in the
recall of FBMs and EMs (Curci & Luminet, 2006; Hirst et al., 2009, 2015; Talarico & Rubin,
2003). Finally, besides supporting the predictive role of rehearsal in FBMs’ (Tinti et al.,
2014) and EMs’ (Hirst et al., 2009, 2015) long-term retention, results of the present study
highlighted the crucial role of the appraisal of importance-consequentiality (Tinti et al.,
2009). Such evaluation of the event had a predictive effect especially in FBMs’ consistent
recall, not only across the first year, but yet also across the second one. As well, importance-
consequentiality had an influence in the formation of EMs at the initial assessment, but not
over later recalls. This difference is particularly interesting, as it reflects our chief hypothesis
that autobiographical information is formed and maintained thanks to the importance and
consequentiality that the event implies for the individual, and this is confirmed also among
long-term periods.
4.5 Conclusion
This study showed that FBMs’ consistency and EMs’ accuracy vary between national
groups as a function of appraisals of importance-consequentiality and intensity of emotion.
Moreover, the phenomenology of FBMs and EMs over long-term periods could be clearly
differentiated: while FBMs were stably consistent over the first and the second year, and
boosted of new information over time, EMs’ accuracy endured a decline over the three tests.
‘Remember’ judgments characterized FBMs’ recollective experience, and ‘Know’ ones
characterized EMs, reflecting an episodic and semantic long-term representation respectively.
Finally, FBMs were predicted by the initial appraisal of importance-consequentiality,
whereas EMs were predicted by the rehearsal of the event via media coverage and the
subsequent rehearsal via speaking and thinking. These results support the claim that FBMs
and EMs might rely on different memory systems, and that their long-term retention might be
independent.
CHAPTER 5. General discussion
5.1 Toward a new understanding of flashbulb memories
The aim of this dissertation was to advance our understanding of the cognitive and
emotional processes underpinning autobiographical memory. We investigated the case of
flashbulb memories (FBMs) and their associated event memories (EMs). FBMs are
autobiographical recalls of the circumstances in which an individual learns for the first time
about an important and emotionally arousing public event (Brown & Kulik, 1977). EMs,
instead, are non-autobiographical recalls of the facts of the event. In recent years, there has
been growing interest in the understanding of these memories (see Luminet & Curci, 2018).
Since Brown and Kulik (1977) first suggested that the recall of FBMs may be indelible,
research has now investigated the long-term evolution (Coluccia et al., 2010; Hirst et al.,
2009, 2015; Kvavilashvili et al., 2009; Schmolck et al., 2000; Tekcan et al., 2003),
phenomenology (Curci et al., 2015; Kizilöz & Tekcan, 2013; Pillemer, 1984), determinants
(Conway et al., 1994; Finkenauer et al., 1998; Tinti et al., 2009, 2014), recollective
experience (Rimmele, Davachi, & Phelps, 2012; Stone, Luminet, & Takahashi, 2015), and
social factors (Berntsen, 2018; Curci et al., 2001; Luminet et al., 2004; Luminet & Curci,
2009) involved in their formation and retention and further investigated their associated EMs
(Hirst et al., 2015; Tinti et al., 2014). However, this extensive body of research has not
always provided converging results and homogeneous conclusions upon the nature of and
relationship between the two. Rather, it has often resulted in heated theoretical debates.
In taking part to this debate, our goal was twofold: to propose a novel
conceptualization of FBMs starting from Brown and Kulik’s seminal theory (1977), and to
highlight the differences between FBMs and EMs. Across each chapter, we gradually
explored the defining characteristics of FBMs (autonoetic consciousness vividness,
confidence, ‘live quality’, reconstructive nature) and the main factors contributing to FBMs’
and EMs’ formation and maintenance (emotion, importance, and rehearsal). Together, these
facets constituted the common thread of this dissertation.
A number of different approaches were employed ranging from a systematic review
of literature to test-retests methodologies, covering a cross-national comparison of memories
of public events, and with a specific focus on the qualitative contents of FBMs. In doing so,
we uncovered important questions of the FBMs’ debate, and succeeded in identifying and
characterising a novel component, namely perceptive core images (Studies 1 and 2), that is
critically involved in the characterization and long-term retention of FBMs. Moreover, we
provided reliable empirical evidence upon how the phenomenology, the recollective
experience, and the predictors of FBMs and EMs can be distinguished (Study 3). Finally,
across the current chapter, we will outline the main findings and conclusions of our work, and
draw the future directions that the proposed theoretical frame has tickled.
5.2 The special status of flashbulb memories
Since the moment in which Brown and Kulik (1977) first defined the phenomenon,
research on FBMs has been a theatre of interminable debates, the aim of which was to answer
to one question above all: are FBMs a special class of autobiographical memories?
Some scholars have addressed this issue in light of the longevity and specificity of these
memories (Berntsen & Thomsen, 2005; Kvavilashvili et al., 2003; Tekcan & Peynircioğlu,
2002), others in terms of their consistency (Conway et al., 1994; Kvavilashvili et al., 2009;
Tinti et al., 2009), still others in terms of the emotional component that would trigger their
formation (Finkenauer et al., 1998). However, no studies have yet attempted to provide an
empirical evidence of what might actually make FBMs special. Here, we proposed that the
special status of FBMs might lie in their iconicity.
We took on the first goal of this dissertation starting from the beginning: we travelled
back to Brown and Kulik (1977) seminal paper, conducted a systematic review of FBMs’
literature to understand the roots of the current debate, and built a solid base to carry on
further empirical research. Results of 37 longitudinal studies revealed a compelling frame:
FBMs are moderately consistent over time, but most importantly, they show uncommonly
high levels of vividness and confidence at recall. Drawing on this finding, we conducted two
empirical studies, which peculiarity and novelty lied in the specific focus we headed to
FBMs’ iconic component. In particular, we found the rationale of our investigation in Brown
and Kulik (1977), when the authors first described FBMs as gifted with an exceptional
perceptual feature, and compared them to the snapshot of a photography. As the authors
themselves stated: “Almost everyone testifies that his recall of his circumstances is not an
inference from a regular routine. It has a primary, ‘live quality’ that is almost perceptual.
Indeed, it is very like a photograph that indiscriminately preserves the scene in which each of
us found himself when the flashbulb was fired” (Brown & Kulik, p. 74). We used this
metaphor, and sought to empirically identify and characterize the contents that would reflect
it. Thus, we worked within two levels of investigation: canonical attributes on the one hand,
and what we labelled perceptive core images on the one other. Canonical categories represent
the contextual information one needs to create a narrative of a memory. For example, the
location in which the event was learned, the news’ informant, the other people present in that
moment, and so on. Perceptive core images, instead, embody the iconic core of such memory.
For this reason, we defined them as perceptual memory contents that carry a marked
vividness at the time of recall. Next, we formulated a specific prediction: perceptive core
images are given by a ‘flash’ that, when activated by emotions, illuminates a number of
specific details of the reception context, and preserves them in memory in an unaltered
fashion. Thus, we argued consistency to be among perceptive core images’ distinctive
features, as suggesting that some details of the reception context are indeed ‘preserved’
without enduring the effect of time (Brown & Kulik, 1977, p. 74). To better understand what
a core image is, we could imagine a student learning about an important news when she is in
class. The details that the ‘flash’ has illuminated might coincide with a number of objects that
the student had in front in that moment: a pen, a text book opened on a specific page, the
screen of the phone in which the news was read. In turn, the reception context attributes (i.e.,
canonical categories), might be the classroom, the teacher, the text message delivering the
news. Finally, and most importantly, to study perceptive core images, we took into account
autobiographical memory’s reconstructive feature, and what Brown and Kulik originally
pointed out: “In short, a flashbulb memory is only somewhat indiscriminate, and is very far
from complete. In these respects, it is unlike a photograph” (Brown & Kulik, 1977, p. 75).
Hence, we predicted that the presence of perceptive core images could either facilitate a
consistent memory recall of other more general and abstract contextual elements (i.e.,
canonical categories), or give raise to biased recollections.
We carried out two studies: one focusing on the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI,
and the other targeting to the terrorist attacks occurred in Paris in November 2015. More than
half of participants of both studies (68% and 73%, respectively) showed to being able to
report at least one core image of their reception context. In addition, the two structural
equation models we presented provided evidence that the formation of perceptive core
images was driven by emotions – specifically, surprise (Study 1) and strong emotions (Study
2) – and that perceptive core images, in turn, were responsible for the recall of canonical
categories. These findings are important for a number of reasons: first, they provide long-
awaited empirical evidence on the component that might embody the special status of FBMs;
second, they highlight a compelling and novel framework on the construction of FBMs; and
most generally, they might help explaining the enduring puzzle of why FBMs often combine
inconsistencies with striking levels of vividness and confidence. Moreover, the significance
of this theoretical frame is compelling for other memory domains beyond FBMs of public
events, such as PTSD eliciting events (Ehlers, Hackmann, & Michael, 2004) and memories
in the law context (Lacy & Stark, 2013). Several cases of eye-witness testimony, for
example, imply the recall of perceptive memory cues, such as details that look like isolated
fragments of a story, e.g., the tunnel effect (Safer, Christianson, Autry, & Österlund, 1998);
while traumatic events triggering PTSD are often characterized by the persistence of intrusive
visual memories of specific details. Being able to identify the nature of these perceptive
elements and the processes by which they are integrated in a coherent narrative is pivotal to
make a meaning of such experiences and guide further clinical interventions.
As we argued at the beginning of this dissertation, autobiographical memory is
reconstructive by definition (Bartlett, 1932). Perceptive core images help to understand where
this processes might start. In fact, this framework implies that the construction of a memory
is constantly subject to the shaping of time, and the subsequent forgetting or distortion of
some details. For this reason, we do not exclude that perceptive core images might be the
starting point of a biased recollection, regardless of their consistency. As well, this process
might entail the boost of new contextual details that are maintained over time. This aspect has
been highlighted in the fourth Chapter of this dissertation, where we showed that the long-
term retention of FBMs of the UK referendum on EU membership – namely, Brexit – was
characterised by an increase of autobiographical details. Over time, participants tended to
report more details about their reception context, also when controlling for their consistency.
This meant that, not only participants reported more details at the second re-test (i.e., over
two years after the event), but that also the consistency between the first (i.e., over one year
after the event) and the second re-test was greater than the consistency at the first and second
re-tests. In line with what we highlighted through the systematic review and the two first
empirical studies pertaining perceptive core images, FBMs were characterised by high levels
of vividness and confidence, yet remaining high over time even under the natural effect of
time.
5.3 Flashbulb and event memories: a tale of two independent stories
The second main goal of this dissertation was to address some important questions
regarding the relation between FBMs and EMs. In particular, we were interested in
investigating whether the two are independent from one another, or whether they influence
each other’s recall. Answering to this question is pivotal for the understanding of
autobiographical memories’ formation. In fact, EMs and FBMs are strictly related, simply
because when learning about an event, both the event itself and the context of learning about
it are simultaneously encoded. Then, when people recollect the original event, they
consciously or unconsciously reactivate the context in which they have learned about it, and
vice-versa (Dumas & Luminet, 2016). However, this is not always the case for their long-
term retention. Our hypothesis was that information which does not entail a ‘subjective time’
– or what Tulving (1985) called an ‘autonoetic’ consciousness of the event – has different
antecedents and phenomenological characteristics compared to the information that includes
an involvement of the self (Conway et al., 2004). Consequentially, this claim advanced the
idea that EM might not be the determinant of FBM – as some research has previously argued
(Finkenauer et al., 1998) – and that the two might not evolve according to similar patterns
and from the same predictors (Tinti et al., 2014).
We tested our hypotheses throughout the three empirical studies presented in this
dissertation. In particular, across Study 1 and 2, we have investigated both the determinants
and the relation between FBMs and EMs using a structural equation model; while, across
Study 3, we have additionally analysed these differences from a phenomenological and
recollective point of view. Results headed in the same direction: EM did not determine the
formation of FBM (see Study 1 and 2); they did not evolve along the same trajectory (see
Study 1, 2, and 3); and the recalls of the two were not accompanied by the same recollective
experiences (see Study 3). More in detail, results of Study 1 and 2 showed that FBMs were
determined by the appraisal of importance-consequentiality when this was mediated by
emotion and perceptive core images. In Study 3, we used two national groups with different
social involvements in the event as a proxy of importance-consequentiality, and found that
this appraisal had a direct effect on FBMs’ consistency at all time points. However, we did
not find an effect of emotion (and we did not measure perceptive core images, which is a
limit of the study). This result could be explained in light of the nature of the event: while the
resignation of Pope Benedict and Paris’ terrorist attacks had triggered high levels of surprise
and negative emotions respectively; the event of Brexit had been unique for the enormous
consequentiality that it carried. Indeed, Brexit threw the UK and the entire Europe in a
political and social climate of uncertainty, and raised multiple debates regarding the future
consequences of such an event. In this respect, we could explain this result in light of the fact
that this event might have initially triggered a strong emotional reaction facilitated by “hot
cognition” processes (cf. Smith, Haynes, Lazarus, & Pope, 1993), that might have, in turn,
contributed to greater FBM’s consistency. Nevertheless, we could hypothesise that the reason
why emotion did not have a predictive power over one and two years from the event is
because participants’ recalls might have rather been guided by “cold cognition” processes,
which might have been facilitated by the great consequentiality of the event. However, this
finding is not new in FBMs’ literature. In fact, previous research has struggled to identify
FBMs’ predictors over very long retention times – for example, Hirst and colleagues (2015)
found that nor intensity of emotion, importance, or proximity to the event successfully
predicted FBMs’ consistency neither over a 3- nor a 10-year time period.
With respect to their evolution, we found that FBMs were stable in all studies –
namely, across retention times of 6, 18, 12, and 23 months. Most interestingly, their
consistency increased over 23 months in Study 3, reflecting a reconstructive hypothesis (see
Chapter 4). Finally, again in Study 3, we observed that the recollective experience of FBMs
was characterized by a predominance of ‘Remember’ judgments, which could reflect an
episodic-like recall of the event (Tulving, 1985, 2002).
On the other side, regarding EMs’ accuracy, we found that it was directly predicted
by the general background knowledge (Conway et al., 1994) and by importance-
consequentiality when this one was mediated by emotion and subsequent rehearsal (Study 1
and 2). Results concerning rehearsal were confirmed also in Study 3, where we observed that
this latter (via media attention, and via conversation and thinking) predicted the accuracy of
EMs at all tests. Importantly, in this study we sought to provide empirical support of previous
studies indicating that different types of rehearsal have different effects on FBMs and EMs
respectively (Tinti et al., 2014). Thus, we disentangled the rehearsal of the event from the
rehearsal of the circumstances, and found that the former always predicted EMs, whereas the
latter predicted FBMs, though only at T1. We attributed this result to the fact that, across the
first year, the rehearsal of the circumstances was still more salient than across the second
year. Finally, we observed that importance-consequentiality had an effect on EMs at T1 only,
reflecting the idea that the formation of EMs at initial assessment might have also been
facilitated by the individual’s concern toward the event (Curci et al., 2001; Tinti et al., 2009).
In fact, greater concern toward the event might have led to greater active rehearsal of the
event, and to greater accuracy in the encoded information. However, we found that EMs
decreased over time, indicating that information pertaining to the event are lost over time,
regardless of other latent factors. In line with this, we observed an increase of ‘Familiar’ and
‘Guess’ judgments over time, and a prevalence of ‘Know’ ones.
Taken together, these results suggest that, even though FBMs and EMs are usually
encoded at the same time, their long-term evolution might be independent. This finding has
important implications for memory research in general, and for real-world concerns such as
the accuracy of eyewitness testimony. In the context of crime eyewitness identification, there
are a number of techniques that are used to enhance memory of the circumstances in which
the crime was committed. For example, the Cognitive Interview (CI) includes a mental
representation of the crime scene in order to facilitate the subsequent recognition of the crime
perpetrator (Fisher & Geiselman, 1992). This interview is designed consistently with the idea
that the recall of the facts of the event might facilitate the recall of the circumstances in which
this was learned. Results of the studies we carried out in this dissertation, actually suggest
that this might not always be the case. Rather, they support the idea that the recall of factual
information does not necessarily imply the recall of other autobiographical ones. In fact, as
Tinti et al. (2014) argued, there might be some cases in which “People may recall details
about an event without remembering the circumstances in which they first learned about it.
People may also recall how they first learned about an event without recalling many details
about the event itself.” (Tinti et al., 2014, p. 11). As the authors suggest, the fact that FBMs
result from reconstructive processes and the fact that they can exist independently from EMs,
deserves further research.
5.4 Concluding remarks and future directions
The main contribution of this work has been the advancement of a novel perspective
to explain the nature of FBMs and their associated EMs. We fostered the current FBM debate
introducing perceptive core images. Moreover, we differentiated the phenomenology,
recollective experience, and antecedents of FBMs and EMs respectively. The frame we
proposed has raised a number of related research questions: are perceptive core images
unique to FBMs? Are perceptive core images triggered by events carrying a positive
emotional valence? What are the consequences of conceptualizing FBMs and EMs as two
different memory systems?
First of all, future research should aim to the replication of our findings. This goal
could be achieved by following the procedure we outlined, and by additionally assessing the
presence of perceptive core images in a multiple re-tests study. As well, it would be
important to verify the presence of this component among positive events as well, also in
order to address the question of whether negative events are more likely to trigger more
intense and long-lasting memories. To extend our findings to memories of private events, in
future research, it would be interesting to test whether the recollection of self-defining
memories, among others (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000), is as well characterised by the
presence of perceptive core images, and whether perceptive core images account for memory
reconstruction much in the same way. Finally, concerning the differences we underlined
between FBMs and EMs, future research should investigate more in depth how such
differences come about, and whether the path we found can be observed among private
events as well. To conclude, we hope that the work presented in this dissertation will help
promote stimulating theoretical and empirical debates as well as fruitful and exciting areas of
future research.
