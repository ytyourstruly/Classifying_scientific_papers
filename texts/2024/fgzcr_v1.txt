24 Abstract
25 Rhythmic auditory stimulation is a commonly used therapeutic method involving repetitive
26 movements cued by rhythmic sounds, aiming to support movement (re-)learning as well as
27 attentional orienting. While musical properties of the cue have been extensively studied, not
28 much is known about the role of individual differences in cognitive and motor abilities that
29 enable sensorimotor synchronization. In this study, 50 participants performed a finger tapping
30 task under various conditions. Tapping was performed as a stand-alone task (single task), and
31 simultaneously with 2-Back working memory task (dual task), to sounds with differing levels of
32 rhythmic complexity (metronome vs. music), both having a clear, steady beat. Standardized
33 neuropsychological tests were related to tapping timing and force in the single task and to their
34 dual task cost (interference). Participants tapped with lower consistency in the dual task for both
35 auditory cues. Poorer cognitive inhibition and better gross motor ability each predicted greater
36 applied force. In contrast, participants with poorer fine motor ability also tapped with lower
37 force. A an inverse U-shape relation emerged (but did not survive sensitivity analysis) between
38 fine motor ability and tapping timing consistency, where both poorer and better fine motor
39 abilities predicted higher consistency. These non-linear relationships were shown for the single
40 and dual tasks, but not for the dual task cost. Overall, this study highlights the complex
41 interactions of aspects of movement and cognitive abilities with sensorimotor synchronization,
42 which is essential to many music-based interventions, and highlights the importance of the
43 consideration of individual baseline abilities.
44 1 Introduction
45 Rhythmic movement to periodic sound (or cues), termed sensorimotor synchronization (SMS,
46 e.g., Repp & Su, 2013) is an inherently human behavior (Lenc et al., 2021) with various clinical
47 applications (Schaefer, 2014; Thaut, 2013), most notably in movement rehabilitation, but also in
48 cognitive rehabilitation. Examples are improved attention allocation in both healthy (Schmidt-
49 Kassow et al., 2013) and clinical populations (Park & Lee, 2018), as well as decreases in
50 attentional load, and improvement of either cognitive or motor performance, holding potential
51 for even more therapeutic applications (Schmid, 2024). However, many aspects of SMS that
52 could be crucial in improving efficacy and/or feasibility are still unknown. Elements of SMS that
53 facilitate or hamper someone’s ability to move to sound include the sound that is used, and the
54 interactions of cognitive and motor functions needed to synchronize (Wittwer, 2013). Here, we
55 aim to further clarify the impact of stimulus complexity (music/metronome) and participants’
56 cognitive and motor functions on both tapping timing consistency and tapping force.
57 Auditory cues for SMS range from simple metronomes to complex musical pieces
58 (Schaefer, 2014). Metronomes offer a stable, predictable pulse, whereas musical cues generally
59 add rhythmic complexity (Koshimoro & Thaut, 2019; Levitin et al., 2018), with implications for
60 clinical settings in which more complex stimuli can be unnecessarily distracting (Rose et al.,
61 2021). Metronomes tend to improve movement consistency, measurable as a lower variance of
62 the tapping intervals, known as the coefficient of variation (CV; Semjen et al., 2000).
63 Conversely, music can improve entrainment in timing accuracy of motor responses (Rose et al.,
64 2019). Comparing music-based to metronome-based tapping suggests that synchronization
65 improves with lower rhythmic complexity (Tranchant et al., 2016). Moreover, beat clarity,
66 referring to the ease of perception of the beat or pulse, appears to be the factor that improves
67 SMS the most (Miguel et al., 2020; Tranchant et al., 2016).
68 SMS inherently involves perceptual, motor, and cognitive aspects (Schaefer, 2014), with
69 cognitive abilities such as memory and attention suggested as possible factors supporting
70 synchronization abilities (c.f. Grahn & Schuit, 2012; Guérin et al., 2021). Dual task paradigms
71 can elucidate cognitive aspects of SMS; task performance generally declines for simultaneous
72 cognitive and motor tasks as compared to single tasks. For instance, when walking while
73 counting backwards, the deterioration in the dual task (DT) relative to the single task (ST)
74 indicates the Dual Task Cost (DTC). This deterioration in either domain, conceptually termed
75 cognitive-motor interference (CMI), presumably occurs due to competition for underlying
76 cognitive or neural resources (Leone et al., 2017). Typically studied in gait, CMI also occurs in
77 upper-limb movement, with DTC increasing with motor task difficulty (Pohl et al., 2011). The
78 extent of DTC in SMS is less clear, as effects of attentional costs but also facilitation of
79 secondary tasks is reported. Performing a working memory task during SMS reportedly reduces
80 motor consistency (Maes et al., 2015), cognitive performance (Guérin et al., 2021), or both
81 (Bååth et al., 2016). However, cognitive-motor entrainment may also improve cognitive or motor
82 performance, hypothesized as decreasing attentional load of movement tasks (Schmid, 2024).
83 CMI can therefore inform our understanding of SMS mechanisms and varying clinical potential.
84 Morever while for other forms of movement, higher baseline motor and cognitive capabilities
85 may ameliorate cognitive-motor interference (Yogev et al., 2008), for SMS this is unclear.
86 SMS research has often focused on cue properties and perceptual aspects influencing
87 tapping performance (see Levitin et al., 2018), but it remains unknown what individual
88 characteristics contribute to SMS. Tapping abilities exhibit interindividual differences (Mudarris
89 & Schaefer, preprint), and were linked to cognitive (Rabinowitz & Lavner, 2014) and motor
90 abilities (Monier & Droit-Volet, 2019). For instance, better timing in music-cued SMS is
91 predicted by better working memory (Colley et al., 2018; Grahn & Schuit, 2012; Guérin et al.,
92 2021; Zalta et al., 2020), and better inhibitory control (Slater et al., 2018). These relationships
93 persist in populations with neurocognitive deficits, even when accounting for fine motor ability
94 (Löser et al., 2024). Despite SMS being inherently motoric (Arunachalam et al., 2005), studies
95 assessing the extent to which motor abilities predict tapping performance remain limited. Finger
96 tapping ability changes across the lifespan (Ruitenberg et al., 2019), also reflected in fine motor
97 ability (Aoki & Fukuoka, 2010; Drewing et al., 2006). Although fine motor abilities were not
98 associated with auditory cued movement in adults (Lorås et al., 2013), they were associated with
99 differences in SMS variability among children (Monier & Droit-Volet, 2019). SMS similarly
100 suffers in populations with declining motor ability, such as in neurocognitive disorders (Navarro-
101 López et al., 2024; von Schnehen et al., 2022). These associations between age and clinical
102 deficits in motor function with synchronization call for further examination.
103 The current study examines how cognitive and motor functions influence SMS
104 performance in terms of timing consistency and force for different auditory cues (i.e. metronome
105 and music), and cognitive load (ST vs. DT). Specifically, we compare auditory conditions to
106 clarify the effects of rhythmic complexity on timing consistency and tapping force. In a dual-task
107 paradigm, we also examine CMI’s impact on timing consistency and tapping force, for both cue
108 types. Furthermore, we examine whether cognitive abilities (including working memory and
109 inhibitory control), and fine and gross motor abilities predict SMS performance alone or DTC in
110 combination with DT, aiming to elucidate the interplay between cognitive and motor abilities in
111 SMS. Preregistered hypotheses on cognition (AsPredicted.org #103316 on 07/26/2022; H1 and
112 H3) state that tapping consistency (and tapping force) decrease for the DT as compared to the ST
113 condition. Additionally, better fine and gross motor abilities are expected to predict better
114 tapping consistency. Moreover, inhibitory control will inversely predict tapping force, while
115 attention and memory will positively predict tapping consistency. In addition to examining these
116 associations in the ST, they will be investigated for DTC to assess the role of CMI. Better
117 cognitive and motor abilities are expected to lead to lower DTC for both tapping consistency and
118 force.

While this study focuses on the cognitive and motor aspects, other preregistered hypotheses
pertain to subjective factors not examined here, as reported in the methods section. 4
119 2 Methods
120 2.1 Participants
121 Fifty healthy adults (M =22.22±4.04; 76% female) were recruited through university networks
age
122 and social media. Five participants missed tapping data for both conditions due to technical
123 problems or too few taps for analysis for both conditions. Another participant missed data for the
124 metronome condition but was retained in the analysis. The final sample for tapping analyses
125 comprised 45 participants (M =22.49±4.21, range 18-39; 77% females). Sample size
age
126 calculations for a similar within-subject study design and medium effect size (η2=.08; Langhans
127 & Mueller, 2020) indicated that 42 participants were needed for sufficient power (α=.05 and (1-
128 β)=.95), using G*Power 3.1. Participants completed the study in English or Dutch, and
129 handedness was determined using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971).
130 Exclusion criteria were neurological or psychiatric conditions, uncorrected vision or hearing
131 impairments, motor impairments, and color-blindness. The study was approved by The
132 Psychology Research Ethics Committee of the Institute of Psychology at Leiden University
133 (2022-01-05-R.S.Schaefer-V2-3558) and informed consent was obtained in accordance with the
134 Declaration of Helsinki.
135 2.2 Measures
136 2.2.1 SMS task
137 Participants tapped the index finger of their dominant hand to the beat of the cue on a Novation
138 (High Wycombe, UK) Pro Launchpad (64-pad MIDI controller), in a hammer-like fashion. The
139 auditory conditions were presented in random order, and each lasted 64 beats (the first 4 beats
140 were excluded from analysis for start-up effects). The ST was presented first followed by the DT
141 of the same condition. Taps were registered in milliseconds using Max7 software (Cycling ’74,
142 Covina, CA, USA). CV indexed tapping variability, calculated as the standard deviation of the
143 inter-tap interval corrected for mean (range 0-1, with lower scores indicating better consistency).
144 Tapping force was measured as MIDI velocity on a scale from 0-127. Trials with <40 taps were
145 excluded. Trials with <40 taps were excluded.
146 For the DT, participants tapped while performing a 2-N-Back working memory task. Here,
147 letters appeared for 0.5s with 1.5±0.25s between letters. Participants verbally indicated when the
148 current letter matched the target two letters prior, while instructed to do their best in both tasks.
150 calculated by subtracting the single from the dual task performance. For CV, lower values
151 indicate better consistency, thus negative DTC scores indicate greater cost. For force, lower
152 values indicate lower force, and a positive DTC score indicate greater cost. A DTC of 0 indicates
153 no difference.
154 2.2.2 Auditory stimuli
155 Auditory cues, presented through Sony (Tokyo, JP) MDR-ZX110NA headphones, comprised a
156 metronome set at 120 beats per minute (BPM), and a fragment from Genesis by artist Justice
157 (2007, Ed Banger Records/Because Music). This track was selected for its clear and easily
158 detectable beat (117.03 BPM), corresponding closely to the spontaneous motor tempo (McAuley
159 et al., 2006). Both stimuli included 64 beats and were approximately 30 seconds in duration.
160 2.2.3 Neuropsychological measures
161 Participants completed four cognitive measures. The Trail Making Test (TMT; Fine & Delis,
162 2011) measures switching and mental tracking by visuo-spatially tracing either only numbers (A)
163 or alternating numbers and letters (B). The score consists of the time needed for TMT-A
164 subtracted from TMT-B (in seconds); lower scores indicate better switching abilities. The Stroop
165 Color-Word Interference Test (Fine & Delis, 2011) measures cognitive inhibition by subtracting
166 the average time in seconds to complete the reading + color (congruent) trials from the
167 incongruent task, where lower scores indicate poorer inhibition. The D2 Cancellation Test
168 (Brickenkamp & Zillmer, 2010) measures sustained attention and required participants to cross
169 out specific letters in 14 trials of 20s for each. The corrected hit rate requires subtracting false
170 positives from total hits, with higher scores indicating better attentional performance. Finally, the
171 Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT; Rey, 1941) measures immediate and delayed
172 recall or verbal information presented in a word list. The outcome consists of delayed recall
th
173 performance subtracted from the 5 immediate trial recall, with a lower score indicating better
174 memory.
175 To measure motor abilities, the Grooved Pegboard Test (GPT; Roy, 1994) indexed fine motor
176 skills, requiring pegs to be placed in a grooved board as fast as possible. Time (seconds) to
177 completion using the dominant hand is measured, with shorter time indicates better fine motor
178 skills. The Box and Blocks Test (BBT; Mathiowetz et al., 1985) measures gross motor function
179 through the total blocks transferred in 60 seconds using the dominant hand, and higher scores
180 indicate better gross motor function. Participants also completed the Action Research Arm Test
181 (Lyle, 1981), but this was not analyzed as all participants achieved ceiling level.
182 2.4 Procedure
183 In an online preparatory questionnaire, participants provided informed consent and demographic
184 information (including age, gender, and education level) . In the lab, participants completed 35
185 minutes of cognitive measures, followed by 10 minutes of finger-tapping in a sound-isolated
186 booth. Then, motor measures were administered in another 10-15 minutes. The
187 neuropsychological measures were sequenced using Latin Squares counterbalancing. Finally,
188 participants were debriefed and compensated in study credits or €6,50. The entire study lasted
189 approximately 60 minutes.
______________________
2 In the online survey, participants also chose a song for a third condition: a self-selected cue, completed the
Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Müllensiefen et al., 2014), and the Barcelona Music Reward
Questionnaire (Mas-Herrero et al., 2014). After each trial, participants also rated each auditory condition (e.g.,
familiarity, preference, mood) using a visual slider scale. These outcomes were not a part of the present work.
190 2.5 Statistical Analysis
191 Analyses were performed in R (R Core Team, 2024); using the ‘lme4’ package (Bates et al.,
192 2015) for linear mixed effects models (LMM) to assess differences in CV and force between
193 single and dual tasks across both auditory cues. This differs from preregistration as it accounts
194 better for missing data. Due to nonlinear relationships between the neuropsychological measures
195 and tapping outcomes in the ST and DTC, the ‘mgcv’ package for generalized additive models
196 was used (GAMs; Wood, 2017, 2023). This differs from the linear preregistered analyses and
197 includes model estimates and proportion of null deviance explained by the model as relevant
198 outcome indices. Penalized smoothing splines in GAMs accommodated non-linearity while
199 avoiding overfitting. Participants were modeled as a random effect to account for repeated
200 measures. Task, comparing single and dual task conditions, was modeled as fixed effect in
201 LMMs, and Condition, comparing auditory stimulation, was a fixed effect in all models.
202 Restricted Maximum-Likelihood (REML; Bates et al., 2015; Wood, 2011) was used as the
203 estimation method.
204 Box-Cox transformations (MASS package; Venables & Ripley, 2002) addressed non-normally
205 distributed residuals in the LMM on CV. For the LMM on force, transformations did not address
206 non-normality. However, both LMM and GLMs are robust to violations of distributional
207 assumptions (Coupé, 2018; Schielzeth et al., 2020). Thus, for the LMM on force and all GAMs,
208 where normality of residuals was violated (visually inspected, and statistically using the Shapiro-
209 Wilk test), sensitivity analyses of the models were conducted. If normality of residuals and/or the
210 conclusions of the analysis differed between the analyses with and without outliers, the reported
211 analyses excluded residual outliers, otherwise, the residual outliers were included in the reported
212 model (see Supplementary material B).
213 Due to the reported relationships between cognitive and motor abilities, we conducted
214 exploratory GAM analyses to assess whether cognitive measures predicted fine and gross motor
215 function (see supplementary material C). We further explored the relationships between tapping
216 force and CV with cognitive and motor predictors (using similar GAMs analyses as on ST and
217 DTC), but with DT performance (see supplementary material D).

237 with larger CV (lower consistency) during DT than ST across both auditory conditions (see

250 predicted CV (R (adj.)=-0.08, 4.21% deviance explained), but the intercept was significant (see
252 For Force, residuals were non-normally distributed. Removing residual outliers did not change
253 normality or model conclusions; thus, the reported results include residual outliers. The Durbin-
254 Watson test indicates auto-correlation (DW=1.41, p=.002), which is accounted for by the
255 experimental design. For both the ST (edf=4.80, df=5.85, X =16.58, p=.009) and DT (edf=4.79,
256 df=5.83, X =19.27, p=.003), Stroop interference non-linearly predicted higher force at both low

264 For CV, residuals were non-normally distributed, however, normality improved when removing
265 residual outliers. As model conclusions differed, results are reported without residual outliers.
266 Only GPT initially predicted CV in ST (edf=2.42, df=3.04, X =7.97, p=.047), however with

298 Auditory cues did not significantly predict DTC in any of the GAMs (see supplementary Tables
299 B7-10).
300 4 Discussion
301 We investigated whether individual differences in cognitive and motor abilities predicted
302 rhythmic finger tapping (as measured by timing consistency and force) under ST and DT
303 conditions. We used auditory cues with varying rhythmic complexity but high beat clarity
304 (metronome vs. music). The present study results showed that tapping consistency, but not force,
305 declined for DT. Additionally, individual differences in cognitive switching/inhibition inversely
306 predicted tapping force, with poorer inhibition predicting greater force. For motor abilities, better
307 gross motor function predicted greater force, whereas those with the poorest fine motor ability
308 applied less force. Furthermore, an inverse-U relationship emerged for fine motor ability and
309 tapping consistency, where the poorest and best fine motor abilities predicted better consistency
310 than the middle range, but this was no longer significant in the model without residual outliers.
311 Except for the fine motor ability-consistency association, these non-linear relationships were
312 evident in both ST and DT, but not for DTC, indicating no specific competition for resources.
313 Moreover, no tapping differences were observed between the metronome and music conditions.
314 Exploratory analyses on DT indicated that task switching and memory recall predict lower
315 tapping force, which was not shown for ST. Thus, adding cognitive load only deteriorated SMS
316 timing and not tapping force. While finger tapping to music or a metronome was not different,
317 individuals’ cognitive and motor abilities are shown to predict SMS aspects, where better
318 cognitive inhibition and fine motor ability predicted lower tapping force, and gross motor
319 function predicted higher tapping force. These non-linear relations were evident irrespective of
320 cognitive load.
321 4.1 Rhythmic Complexity and Beat Clarity
322 Not identifying an effect of auditory cue complexity on SMS may be related to beat clarity.
323 While beat clarity and rhythmic complexity are conceptually related (Merker et al., 2009; Miguel
324 et al., 2020) both variably influence tapping consistency (Levitin et al., 2018). Although
325 synchronization is often better with lower rhythmic complexity, such as in a metronome
326 (Tranchant et al., 2016), positive effects of music in rhythmic movement are also reported (Rose
327 et al., 2021) among aging (Wittwer et al., 2013) and clinical populations (Rose et al., 2019). We
328 do not find differences between cues with high beat clarity, which thus may be the most salient
329 cue aspect for this movement type. As only one sound fragment per cue was used, this does not
330 preclude differences when varying other features, but it suggests that with consistent beat clarity,
331 similar SMS is observed.
332 4.2 Neuropsychological Predictors of SMS
333 Working memory was previously reported to be implicated in SMS (Colley et al., 2018; Grahn &
334 Schuit, 2012). Additionally, negative autocorrelations of inter-tap intervals were reported for
335 tempo-varying SMS, indicative of a predictive strategy, and attributed to attentional
336 involvement. Moreover, a dual cognitive-motor paradigm led to slowed tapping responses
337 (Guérin et al., 2021), suggesting cognitive involvement. The present finding that tapping
338 consistency was more variable for DT than ST matches these previous observations. Notably, the
339 finding on cognitive inhibition echoes previous results of inhibitory control predicting timing
340 variability in healthy participants (Slater et al., 2018) and those with neurocognitive disorders
341 (Löser et al., 2024), establishing the crucial involvement of cognitive inhibition in SMS (Guérin
342 et al., 2021; Löser et al., 2024). The current findings highlight the relationship of cognitive
343 inhibition and tapping force irrespective of cognitive load, with lower cognitive
344 inhibition/switching ability predicting harder tapping. We attribute this to poorer cognitive
345 inhibition leading to inefficient motor output, replicating a previous finding (Mudarris &
346 Schaefer, preprint).
347 Considering motor abilities and SMS, fine motor skills were previously not found to be
348 associated with SMS timing in young adults (Lorås et al., 2013), in contrast to working memory
349 and processing speed. However, the role of cognition in both fine and gross motor skills was
350 investigated using a dual cognitive-motor task, and poorer fine motor skill was associated with
351 DT performance in a fine, but not a gross motor DT (Raisbeck & Diekfuss, 2015). Similarly, the
352 present study found that poorer fine motor ability predicted lower force. Fine motor ability also
353 explained finger tapping variability in children (Monier & Droit-Volet, 2019), further
354 underlining the link between fine motor function and SMS. The marginally identified inverse-U
355 relationship where those with lowest and highest fine motor abilities have better tapping
356 consistency may also relate to the association of cognitive and motor abilities (Piek et al., 2008;
357 see also supplementary material C), including spontaneous finger tapping being associated with
358 attention and working memory abilities (Rabinowitz & Lavner, 2014). These findings suggest
359 that motor abilities could influence SMS through these cognitive domains (Guérin et al., 2021).
360 The current results indicate gross motor function (gripping and moving blocks) also predicts
361 SMS force. This could be due to underlying neural commonalities associated with flexing the
362 fingers (Inui & Katsura, 2002), and applying upper-limb strength. Together, these findings
363 elucidate the interactions of motor and cognitive abilities in SMS timing and force.
364 4.3 Cognitive-Motor Interference in SMS
365 Matching prior literature (Maes et al., 2015), we observed that a dual cognitive task hindered
366 SMS timing consistency, but not force. Despite finding cognitive and motor predictors of force
367 in ST and DT, neither predicted DTC. This contrasts with different movement types such as
368 walking (Yogev et al., 2008), where better cognitive capacity predicts lower DTC in older adults
369 and patients with neurological disorders. While SMS is not similarly affected here, this may be
370 due to limited neuropsychological variation in the current sample, leading to smaller DTC.
371 Moreover, previous results suggest that the cognitive DT presentation timing relative to the
372 motor task yields exacerbated interference when presented earlier than expected (Langhanns &
373 Mueller, 2020). As DT timing was not manipulated here, greater interference might be induced
374 in this way. Other effects may be seen with the use of the non-dominant hand (Moore et al.,
375 2017; Navarro-López et al., 2024) or in bimanual tasks (Kim & Yoo, 2019).
376 4.4 Limitations and Future Directions
377 Prior studies finding associations between cognitive and motor abilities in SMS used the
378 synchronization-continuation paradigm (Löser et al., 2024; Slater et al., 2018; Zalta et al., 2020),
379 where tapping rhythm needs to be maintained after discontinuing the auditory cue, increasing
380 cognitive demands. As the current null findings could relate to a lack of challenge and lower
381 DTC, future studies may address this by increasing task difficulty, through synchronization-
382 continuation paradigm, a more complex motor sequence, and/or increasing cognitive difficulty
383 (e.g., 3 or 4-back task). Moreover, other studies discussed here include tempo-varying cues, also
384 increasing cognitive load (Colley et al., 2018; Guérin et al., 2021), but the current results can
385 only speak to stable cues with high beat clarity.
386 4.5 Conclusions & Implications
387 Overall, this study highlights the contributions of cognitive inhibition and both fine and gross
388 motor abilities to SMS timing consistency and force for ST and DT, but not DTC. As music-
389 based interventions are commonly used in cognitive and motor rehabilitation, our findings
390 identify a need to assess baseline abilities of the individuals in considering their capacity to
391 engage in rhythmic auditory synchronization, over and above the choice of auditory cue.
392 Moreover, we show that adding a cognitive load deteriorates motor timing consistency,
393 extending findings of cognitive motor interference to auditory cued movement. These findings
394 further our understanding of auditory-based movement, the role of individual cognitive and
395 motor abilities, and their implications for music-based interventions, which inherently involve
396 motor, cognitive, and perceptual domains.
