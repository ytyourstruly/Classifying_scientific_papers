Going Along with an Authoritarian or Laissez-Faire Boss: Why We
Pretend to Believe Fake News—and Think Our Peers Do Even More
Abstract
This study (N=406) investigates how leadership style shapes perceptions of peer responses to a boss’s
fake news views. Under both authoritarian and laissez-faire leadership, individuals believe their
coworkers are more likely than themselves express agreement. However, laissez-faire leadership
uniquely amplifies these perceptions of peer compliance compared to autonomous leadership,
underscoring the influence of passive leadership on workplace interactions surrounding controversial
beliefs.
Introduction
Imagine sitting in a meeting where your boss shares information that you strongly believe to
be untrue. Like your colleagues, you stay silent. Later, you ask yourself: would speaking up
have been worth the risk? Now, picture a new intern observing this silence—they might
interpret it as a norm, assuming that disagreement has no place in this room. This raises a
critical question: what leadership characteristics encourage employees to voice disagreement
in such situations? Conversely, what compels people to remain silent, even when the boss’s
statements are probably false? Understanding these dynamics sheds light on how leadership
styles shape conformity and silence in the workplace.
People may privately recognize that certain information is false (informational beliefs), so
private compliance is not at issue here. Instead, we argue that their behavior aligns with
normative beliefs, leading individuals to publicly agree with misinformation if they perceive
others doing the same. Pluralistic ignorance emerges when individuals systematically misjudge or
misperceive their peers' opinions, beliefs, or behaviors (Miller, 2023). Prior research highlights
a bidirectional relationship between pluralistic ignorance and misinformation: misinformation
can fuel pluralistic ignorance (Castioni et al., 2022), while misjudging majority opinions
creates conditions for misinformation to spread more easily (Sparkman et al., 2022). Even
when individuals know their opinion aligns with the majority, they often hesitate to challenge
a vocal minority (Dixon et al., 2024a, 2024b). These findings prompt a more profound
question: What forces might lead employees to believe their coworkers fail to notice when their leader says
something false?
One intuitive explanation lies in leadership style. Building on Ospina et al. (2023), we propose a
prototype model with four leadership styles: autonomy-supportive, paternalistic,
authoritarian, and laissez-faire. Autonomy-supportive leaders prioritize employee input, creativity,
and effort. They encourage open expression and view dissent as essential for success and
meaningful change. In contrast, paternalistic leaders emphasize loyalty and adherence to formal
rules, reserving ultimate decision-making power while offering support conditionally based on
compliance with these rules. Authoritarian leaders demand loyalty and agreement, linking
success to alignment with their views and discouraging dissent through exclusion or loss of
opportunities. Finally, laissez-faire leaders remain largely disengaged, showing minimal interest
in employees’ ideas or success and little involvement in decision-making, offering neither
support nor a drive for systemic change.
Previous research has explored that authoritarian leadership relates to agreement with
misinformation (Ospina et al., 2023). This might provide ground for organizational pluralistic
ignorance (a very understudied research topic, e.g., Fuller, 2023) by discouraging free speech,
weakening communication, and creating psychologically unsafe environments. However, the
role of laissez-faire leadership in fostering public or private compliance with misinformation and
pluralistic ignorance still needs to be explored in the literature.
This study represents an initial step into pluralistic ignorance within organizational
misinformation research, so our hypotheses remain preliminary. We anticipate that
authoritarian leadership will heighten pluralistic ignorance, unlike autonomy-supportive and
paternalistic leadership styles. However, whether this effect arises from normative beliefs (public
compliance) or informational beliefs (private compliance) remains an open question. We also
suspect leadership style will introduce discrepancies between individuals’ normative and
informational beliefs. As laissez-faire leadership remains largely unexplored, we do not
formulate specific hypotheses for this style, instead opting to keep the related analysis
exploratory.
Participants
The non-representative sample of 402 US participants was recruited via Prolific and screened
to include only individuals with part-time (15.9%) or full-time (82.6%) employment.
Participants ranged in age from 19 to 86 (M = 41.34, SD = 12.48). Nearly half identified as
women (47%), 52.2% as men, and 0.5% identified with another gender. The majority of
participants were non-Hispanic White (57.5%), with the remaining 42.5% identifying as
Black, Asian, Hispanic, Indian, Middle Eastern, Native American, or Pacific Islander.
Educationally, 44.5% held a four-year college degree, 33.8% had no degree, and 21.6%
reported a postgraduate degree. The study was approved by a US university ethics
committee, conducted in line with the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants provided
informed consent.
Measures
Personal and Coworker’s Expectations to Agree with Fake News Articles.
Participants were presented with four fake politically-neutral news articles headlines
(Pennycook & Rand, 2019; e.g., “The Controversial Files: Fake Cigarettes are Being Sold and Killing
People, Here’s How to Spot Counterfeit Packs”; “Man Kicked Out Golden Corral After Eating 50LBS of
Food; Sues for $2 Million”) and indicated the extent they (or their coworker) would be expected
to openly agree with their boss on each news headline (i.e., “Imagine your boss sent this article to
one of your social media accounts, you meet with them, and they ask you about this article. To what extent
would you be expected to openly agree with your boss, [boss name]?”; “Imagine your boss sent this article to
your coworkers’ social media accounts, each of them meet with your boss, and your boss asks them about the
article. To what extent would your coworkers be expected to openly agree with your boss, [boss name]?”) using
a five-point scale (1=Not at all to 5=Extremely).
Personal and Coworker’s Genuine Belief in Fake News Articles. Participants
assessed the extent to which they (or their coworker) would genuinely believe in the same
news headlines that their boss shared (i.e., “How much would you [your co-worker] genuinely believe in
the article that your boss, [boss name], shared?”) using a five-point scale (1=Not at all to 5=Completely).
Sociodemographic Information. Socioeconomic status was assessed with the subjective
SES scale from the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Socioeconomic Status and
Health socio-demographic questionnaire (for an example, see Gage-Bouchard et al. (2013);
see details in the Appendix). Participants reported their gender identity, age, level of
education, parental education, race/ethnicity, and political ideology as detailed in the
Appendix.
Results
The Effect of the Target and Leadership Style on the Expectation to Agree with
Fake News Articles
Participants believed their coworkers (M = 2.14, SD = 1.11) were more likely than they were
(M = 2.09, SD = 1.10) to openly agree with their boss about the fake news article, t(401) = -
3.42, 95% CI [-0.081, -0.022], p < .001. Showing a belief that they would be less influenced
by their boss than their colleagues. This belief was larger under laissez-faire leadership than
under autonomous leadership (b = 0.13, t = 2.55, p = .011), but otherwise showed no
function of leadership style and target, error bars represent 95% CI.
Pluralistic Ignorance: The Effect of the Target and Leadership Style on Genuine
Belief with Fake News Headlines
Participants believed their coworkers (M = 2.25, SD = 0.83) were more likely to believe the
fake news than themselves (M = 2.02, SD = 0.87), t(401) = -9.60, 95% CI [-0.273, -0.181], p
< .001, expressing the belief that they more than their colleagues were suppressing their
genuine beliefs, a clear example of pluralistic ignorance. This pluralist ignorance effect
remained significant across all leadership styles, but was amplified under laissez-faire
leadership compared to autonomous leadership (b = 0.31, t = 4.13, p < .001),suggesting that
people assume their coworkers are even more likely to agree with fake news under laissez-faire
leadership than under supportive leadership. Interestingly, participants’ pluralistic ignorance
grew from autonomous leadership to paternalistic leadership, authoritarian leadership, and
as a function of leadership style and target, error bars represent 95% CI.
Discussion
Our study examined whether pluralistic ignorance influences compliance behaviors with
misinformation in an organizational context. Specifically, we explored whether individuals
perceive discrepancies between their own compliance and their coworkers' compliance.
Overall, participants believed their coworkers were more likely than themselves to comply
with their boss’s misinformation, believing they would be less susceptible to this sort of social
influence than their peers. They also showed clear signs of pluralistic ignorance. This
included agreeing with the boss and even genuinely believing the misinformation—such as
accepting a fake news article as true. In short, participants saw their coworkers as more likely
to comply with leadership both publicly and privately, regardless of leadership style.
We found that pluralistic ignorance in general and public compliance emerged under
authoritarian and laissez-faire leadership. Under these styles, participants believed coworkers
were more expected to agree with their boss than themselves. They also believed their
coworkers were more likely than themselves to agree with the fake news article. In contrast,
no such discrepancies appeared under autonomous or paternalistic leadership styles, where
participants viewed their own and their coworkers’ compliance similarly.
For private compliance, participants believed their coworkers were more gullible—more
likely to genuinely believe the fake news—regardless of leadership style. However, this
discrepancy was amplified under laissez-faire leadership compared to autonomous leadership.
While people under both styles thought their coworkers were more gullible, those with laissez-
faire leaders were far more likely to believe their coworkers genuinely accepted the fake news
article. This suggests that as leaders become less supportive, pluralistic ignorance of private
compliance increases.
