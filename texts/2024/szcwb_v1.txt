Abstract
The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 has sparked discussions about integrating Generative
Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into teacher education. Teacher educators, as key facilitators of pre-
service teachers, play a critical role in determining the successful adoption of GenAI. Their perceptions
guide curriculum redesign, define best practices, and shape pre-service teachers’ experiences with
GenAI, potentially multiplying its impact across future classrooms. This mixed-methods study explored
Danish teacher educators’ perceptions of GenAI (n = 91), focusing on its transformative potential,
challenges, and the knowledge pre-service teachers need to acquire. The study employed innovative
methods, including GenAI-enhanced thematic analysis and Natural Language Processing, to analyze
qualitative and quantitative data. Results highlight diverse perceptions, ranging from enthusiasm for
fostering innovative teaching practices (AI didactics) to concerns about ethical implications, assessment
challenges (AI assessment), and safeguarding basic skill acquisition. Teacher educators emphasized the
need for pre-service teachers to acquire AI literacies—AI as a teaching tool, content, and learning tool—
framed within ethical, cultural, and democratic boundaries. Mediation analyses revealed that intrinsic
motivation and confidence significantly predicted teacher educators’ use of GenAI, fully mediating their
perceptions of its potential. Findings highlight the importance of professional development initiatives
that offer hands-on GenAI experiences and informal, collaborative opportunities to address its rapid
development. This study highlights GenAI’s transformative potential for teacher education and the
complex skillset pre-service teachers need to engage critically and responsibly, ensuring its integration
aligns with educational and societal values.

1. Introduction
With the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, teacher education institutions and educators have been
discussing how to incorporate Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into their educational programs.
Teacher educators' perceptions of GenAI's role in teacher education will guide curriculum redesign,
define the best practices they promote, and shape how they support pre-service teachers' early
experiences with GenAI in teaching practice (Korthagen, 2016; Moorhouse & Kohnke, 2024). As teacher
educators play a crucial role in determining the practices and beliefs of pre-service teachers (Bai &
Ertmer, 2008), their integration of GenAI into teacher education is likely to have a multiplying effect.
After teacher education, pre-service teachers will transfer their educational experiences to future
classrooms, impacting school students. Hence, teacher educators’ perceptions of GenAI in teacher
education play a significant role in determining its successful adoption both at teacher education
institutions and at schools.
In general, research shows that higher education teachers are slow to adopt new technologies (Liu
et al., 2020). However, GenAI, such as ChatGPT or Claude, differ from prior educational technology
concerning its accessibility, versatility, and pervasive nature in society in general (Kasneci et al., 2023).
Due to their capabilities, GenAI tools are seen as a disruptor of the status quo in education but also a
catalyst for rethinking learning and teaching (Jensen et al., 2024). Researchers attest GenAI potential to
positively impact education, however, also harm student learning (Abbas et al., 2024; Hansen et al., 2024;
Kasneci et al., 2023). Consequently, educators acknowledge that they have to adapt rapidly to the
opportunities and challenges brought on by GenAI (e.g., McGrath et al., 2023; Moorhouse & Kohnke,
2024). Despite their crucial role, teacher educators’ perceptions are underexplored. To date, only
Moorhouse and Kohnke (2024) have examined English language teacher educators' perceptions of
GenAI, focusing on the early months following ChatGPT's release, a time when institutions and
educators were just beginning to adapt to this emerging technology.
This study therefore examined teacher educators' perceptions of the potential impact of AI on
teacher education and the essential knowledge pre-service teachers need to acquire. To better understand
the factors shaping teacher educators' perceptions, the study also investigated the roles of confidence,
intrinsic motivation, and teacher educators’ use of AI in teaching. Using a mixed-methods approach, the
study collected both qualitative and quantitative data from teacher educators teaching at all Danish
teacher education institutions. In addition to traditional methods, the research incorporated innovative
techniques, such as Natural Language Processing and GenAI-enhanced thematic analysis.
Consequently, this study sheds light on teacher educators’ perceptions of AI in teacher education
and factors shaping these. It offers insights into reimagining teaching and learning in the GenAI era and
outlines the skills that teacher educators believe pre-service teachers must develop. Based on this, the
study thus highlights key areas for professional development and identifies essential components of AI
literacy for teacher education programs. Furthermore, it provides insights into how Natural Language
Processing and GenAI can assist qualitative and quantitative-qualitative data analysis in educational
research.
2. Literature review
2.1 Opportunities and challenges of GenAI in education
GenAI tools are based on large language models trained on massive amounts of data and have impacted
the educational landscape due to their accessibility and diverse applications. In response to prompts (e.g.,
instructions, questions) they generate new, human-like content (e.g., images, text) and imitate human
abilities and skills, such as identifying patterns or making decisions (Kasneci et al., 2023; Sheikh et al.,
2023). This technical capability presents significant opportunities in education, for enhancing student
learning and reducing teacher workload. From a learner perspective, key benefits of GenAI tools in
educational contexts include tailored support for individual learning needs, personalized feedback, or
creating new learning situations with artificial conversation partners (Kasneci et al., 2023; Wu & Zu,
2023). While these capabilities can promote student learning, they also require educators to rethink
teaching, learning, and assessment (Mah et al., 2023; Dawson et al., 2024; Jensen et al., 2024). From an
educator's perspective, a professional use of GenAI tools can also be beneficial to their work. GenAI
tools can assist with organizational tasks, lesson planning, materials preparation, and assessment,
allowing for a more focused approach to individual student support (Celik et al., 2022; Jensen et al.,
2024)
However, despite the potential outlined, the integration of GenAI tools in education is not without
its pitfalls. Increased reliance on GenAI tools could risk limiting a person’s ability to solve problems
independently as well as their critical thinking, interpersonal competencies, and retention of core
academic skills (Farrokhnia et al, 2023; Kasneci et al., 2023). Furthermore, users need to be capable to
evaluate GenAI output to detect misinformation generated by GenAI tools (Ng et al., 2023). In addition,
the integration of GenAI is challenging traditional assessment practices. GenAI tools make it difficult to
verify independent authorship in student work. Hence, the educational community is currently debating
when GenAI should be integrated into assessments tasks (Dawson et al., 2024; Lodge et al., 2023).
2.2 The need for AI literacy in education
Given GenAI's transformative potential in education, educators need to be enabled to use AI tools
effectively to harness its benefits while mitigating its risks. Hence, educators need to acquire AI literacy.
A notable definition of AI literacy, as proposed by Long and Magerko (2020), characterizes it as "a set
of competencies that enable individuals to critically evaluate AI technologies, communicate and
collaborate effectively with AI, and use AI as a tool online, at home, and in the workplace" (p. 2). This
definition has evolved to differentiate between generic AI literacy, a fundamental understanding of AI,
and domain-specific AI literacy, which pertains to AI applications in specific fields such as medicine or
education (Mah & Groß, 2024; Knoth et al., 2024; Ng et al., 2021).
In education, AI literacy represents a significant challenge for educators and students (Bond et
al., 2023; Ifenthaler et al., 2024). Emotional and motivational barriers, such as anxiety and discomfort,
further complicate AI literacy adoption (Yang et al., 2025). In light of the recent advances and rise of
generative AI, a number of institutions have begun providing guidelines and developing frameworks to
enhance AI literacy for both educators and students (Celik, 2023a; Chiu et al., 2024; Wang & Lester,
2023). For instance, the TPACK framework has been adapted to the GenAI era (Mishra & Koehler, 2006;
Mishra et al., 2023). TPACK consists of three major components of teacher knowledge: content (CK),
pedagogy (PK), and technology (TK) with their intersections of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK),
technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK), and technological content knowledge (TCK) (Mishra &
Koehler, 2006). Celik (2023b) extended the TPACK framework with the knowledge of ethical aspects
and proposed the Intelligent TPACK framework. UNESCO (2024) introduced a global AI competency
framework for educators, highlighting competencies such as human-centered mindset, AI ethics, and AI
pedagogy. Concerning AI pedagogy, educators require the “capacity to critically adapt and creativity
explore innovative practices in the context of advancing capabilities of emerging AI iterations” (p. 23).
2.3 The role of teacher educators in AI adoption
In teacher education, teacher educators can be assumed to have significant impact on how pre-service
teachers acquire AI literacy and, as a result, how GenAI is implemented in pre-service teachers’ future
classrooms (Moorhouse & Kohnke, 2024). Teacher educators bridge theory and practice by
demonstrating professional teaching through explicit methods, such as lectures and tutorials, while
implicitly modeling reflective and innovative teaching practices. Furthermore, they help pre-service
teachers integrate theoretical knowledge with practical learning opportunities (European Commission,
2013). Beyond their teaching role, teacher educators contribute significantly to curriculum development.
They delineate learning outcomes, guide pre-service teachers, and assess their progress (Korthagen,
2016; Moorhouse & Kohnke, 2024).
Teacher educators’ perceptions guide their educational practices (Pajares, 1992). Perceptions are the
opinions, beliefs, and attitudes that individuals hold about particular topics or issues. They reflect how
individuals perceive, interpret, and respond to their environment (Abel et al., 2022; Zhai, 2024).
Educators’ perceptions are formed by their experiences (Pajares, 1992). Perceptions are influenced by,
for example, a person’s intrinsic motivation or confidence to engage with educational technology
(Ayanwale et al., 2022; Deci & Ryan, 2000; Ertmer, 2005). In the context of teacher education, intrinsic
motivation and confidence may lead teacher educators to use GenAI tools themselves and alter their
perception of the value of these tools for teacher education. Hence, understanding teacher educators’
perceptions of GenAI and factors contributing to them is essential for addressing potential
misconceptions and equipping them to integrate GenAI effectively into educational practices. However,
to date, there has only been one study (Moorhouse & Kohnke, 2024) focusing specifically on teacher
educators’ perceptions of AI from the first months of ChatGPT availability (April 2023). Moorhouse and
Kohnke interviewed thirteen teacher educators at universities in Hong Kong offering language education.
Their findings indicate that participants anticipate GenAI tools will have a significant impact on the
curriculum, instruction, and assessment. Participants believed they could play a crucial role in modeling
the use of GenAI tools, but felt they lacked guidance concerning assessment in a GenAI world. The
majority of participants expressed concerns about their own AI literacy in effectively addressing the
challenges and opportunities posed by these tools.
Research regarding technology in general and not focusing on teacher education exclusively, offers
additional insights. Concerning technology in general, research consistently indicates that higher
education teachers tend to adopt new technologies at a slow pace (Liu et al., 2020). Teacher educators,
at times, struggle to recognize the rationale for integrating technology (Ngao et al., 2022). Contributing
factors include educators' anxiety about adopting new technologies (Zimmerman, 2006) and a tendency
to remain within their comfort zones, relying on familiar materials and methodologies (Tallvid, 2016).
Educators who view GenAI as tools that enhance their instructional practices are more inclined to adopt
its use in the classroom (Kaplan-Rakowski et al., 2023). In general, GenAI may lead to a different
response. Moorhouse and Kohnke (2024) found that teacher educators perceived GenAI as a
”fundamentally different technology from other technological advances” (p. 8). This is supported by
findings from the general higher education field. Ofosu-Ampong (2024) found that a large amount of
higher education teachers expressed willingness to accept AI integration. Furthermore, Mah & Groß
(2024) found that higher education faculty saw greater equity in education as the biggest benefit of AI,
while the lack of AI literacy among students and faculty was among the greatest challenges. In addition,
faculty members were highly interested in pursuing professional development opportunities in the field
of AI. McGrath et al. (2023) found participants assessed their AI literacy and the impact on equity
differently. Higher education teachers reported concerns about AI adoption, including fears and
skepticism regarding its fairness and ethical implications, as well as a lack of knowledge and resources
needed to integrate AI effectively into teaching practices.
3. Research questions
Against this background, this article investigates the following research questions:
a) What are teacher educators’ perceptions of the potential of AI for teacher education?
b) How do intrinsic motivation, confidence, and the use of AI in teaching influence teacher
educators’ perceptions about the potential of AI in teacher education?
c) Which AI knowledge do teacher educators perceive as crucial for pre-service teachers?
4. Method
4.1 Sample and procedure
Participants from all university colleges in Denmark were invited to participate in the study. Data were
collected between May and June 2024. E-mails with a link to the survey on SurveyXact were sent to
publicly available e-mail addresses of teacher educators listed on the respective institutions' websites.
In total, 91 teacher educators (59.3% female, 38.9% male, 1.1% no disclosure) completed the
survey. They were largely from the age groups 50-59 (36.3%) and 60-69 (34.1%) (30-39 years old -
3.3%, 40-49 – 9.9%, 70 or older – 15.4%, no disclosure – 1.1%) and had a large variation of teaching
experience at university college (3-6 years – 25.3%, 7-9 – 12.1%, 10-19 – 13.2%, 20-29 – 25.3%, 30-39
– 20.9%, 40 or more – 3.3%). Most participants were either associate professors (64.8%) or assistant
professors (26.4%) and employed at one of the VIA university colleges (33%) (Absalon – 7.7%,
Copenhagen - 11%, Lillebælt – 9.9%, Nordjylland – 11%, Syd – 11%, no disclosure – 16.5%). The
response rate of 13.13% (693 teacher educators invited) was comparable to similar open survey studies
(e.g., Byman et al., 2020).
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Ethics Review Board at [blinded for peer
review] ([ethics approval number]). All participants received written information detailing their rights,
the study's purpose, its procedures, and provided active consent before participation.
4.2 Instruments
Participants completed subscales on intrinsic motivation for learning about AI and confidence of using
AI from the AI literacy questionnaire developed by Ng et al. (2023). The scale on intrinsic motivation
consists of four items (e.g., I am curious about discovering new AI technologies.). Teacher educators'
confidence of using AI was assessed with five items (e.g., I can make good use of AI related tools.).
Teacher educators were asked to judge the statements on a 6-point Likert scale, ranging from “strongly
disagree” to “strongly agree”. Internal consistency coefficients (Cronbach’s α = .82,
intrinsic motivation
α = .85) were good.
confidence
To assess teacher educators’ use of AI for teaching, we developed items based on a recent AI study
(von Garrel et al., 2023). The scale consists of eleven items focusing on different uses of AI in the
teaching context (e.g., In the context of my teaching, I use AI for creating teaching materials for myself.;
In the context of my teaching, I use AI to generate feedback for students.). Teacher educators rated the
statements on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from “not at all” to “very often”. Cronbach’s α showed
excellent internal consistency, α = .91.
4.3 Teacher educators’ perceptions
The survey contained two open-ended questions. The questions were based on previous studies
(Antonenko & Abramowitz, 2023; Moorhouse & Kohnke, 2024) that explored educators’ perceptions of
AI in education. Teacher educators were asked, "What do you think about the potential of AI to influence
teacher education?” and “What do you think is important for student teachers to understand about AI?”.
While answers to both questions were analyzed using thematic analysis (for details see below), sentiment
analysis was conducted on answers to the first question to be able to analyze the qualitative data in
combination with the quantitative data. For sentiment analysis (Falcon & Leon, 2023) it was important
to use an open-ended question that allows participants to consider both positive and negative possibilities,
enabling them to explore both benefits and drawbacks of AI’s impact on teacher education.
The sentiment analysis was conducted using the pre-trained model provided by Asent. It utilizes
natural language processing methods, like tokenization, to extract features from textual data. Hence, it
divides the text into units of analysis called tokens. Applying mathematical algorithms to comprehend
the context and meaning of the text, it classifies the units of analysis into different sentiments. Asent
utilizes a weighted lexicon of word sentiments and uses a rules-based approach to calculate the impact
of syntactical variables such as negation and amplifiers (Enevoldsen, 2022).
4.4 Data analysis
4.4.1 Quantitative analyses
Due to the limited sample size and insufficient statistical power for structural equation modeling, we
decided to work solely with manifest variables. The statistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS
Statistics 29. Missing data were handled using multiple imputation (5 imputations) to ensure a more
robust analysis. Pooled data was used for subsequent analyses.
To analyze the relationships between teacher educators' confidence in using AI, intrinsic
motivation for learning about AI, use of AI for teaching, and their perceptions, Pearson correlation
analyses were performed. The significance level was set at .05 for all analyses.
Two mediation analyses were conducted employing the IBM SPSS PROCESS 4.3.1 macro
(Hayes, 2022; Model 4). As preliminary diagnostics showed a violation of linearity, the dependent
variable (teacher educators’ perceptions) was log-transformed to meet the assumption of linearity for
regression analysis. Following this procedure, all necessary assumptions (linearity, normality,
homoscedasticity, multicollinearity) for mediation analysis were met. Mediation analyses were
performed using bootstrapping with 5000 samples to generate 95% confidence intervals for the indirect
effect. The first mediation analysis assessed whether the relationship between teacher educators’ intrinsic
motivation for learning about AI and their perceptions is mediated by their use of AI for teaching
(mediator variable). The second mediation analysis tested whether the association between teacher
educators’ confidence of using AI and their perceptions is mediated by their use of AI for teaching
(mediator variable).
4.4.2 Qualitative analyses
Teacher educators’ answers to the open-ended questions, “What do you think about the potential of AI to
influence teacher education?” and “What do you think is important for student teachers to understand
about AI?”, were analyzed thematically following Braun and Clarke (2006). The thematic analysis was
enhanced by incorporating GenAI into the process (Morgan, 2023).
4.4.2.1 Procedure
Themes and sub-themes were identified applying a six-step coding procedure. Two of the authors
conducted the thematic analysis. First, the authors read and reread teacher educators’ answers to the
questions to gain an overview of the data. Second, the authors generated a first set of codes, formulated
themes and sub-themes, and cross-checked the codes and (sub-)themes for consistency. Third, the authors
used GenAI (for a detailed description see below) to conduct an additional thematic analysis. An
additional GenAI analysis can be used as a type of balance to possible researcher bias, i.e., themes
prevalent in researchers’ conceptions due to the deep involvement in the research field, to identify
overlooked themes (Moorhouse & Kohnke, 2024). Fourth, the authors reviewed and discussed the initial
(sub-)themes and the GenAI (sub-)themes. This was concluded by clarifying, combining, refining, and
agreeing on the (sub-)themes. Fifth, the entire data set was re-read, coding relevant sections of teacher
educators’ answers to each (sub-)theme. No new themes emerged at this stage. Sixth, after completing
the coding procedure, the authors generated conclusions from the material. The authors presented and
defended their individual conclusions and agreed or challenged the conclusions of each other (Peterson
& Irving, 2008).
4.4.2.2 GenAI-support of the thematic analysis
The thematic analysis was supported by GenAI. The researchers worked with an Ollama User
Interface, hosted through the High Performance Computing service Ucloud, allowing GDPR-compliant
computational services for Danish researchers. The Ollama provided a chatbot interface in which the
researchers could interact with the LLM (Llama 3.1 8b model; benchmarked above GPT 3.5-turbo and
slightly below GPT 4o).
In the following the procedure of the first thematic analysis is exemplified. The researchers used
the GenAI chatbot to identify any themes that were overlooked in the material. In the second step of the
thematic analysis, the researchers identified the themes AI literacy, AI didactics, and AI assessment in
the material. The researchers then prompted the chatbot to analyze the material in the third step: “Use
inductive thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke’s (2006) approach. Identify themes in this data
set. The data consists of answers to an open-ended survey question posed to teacher educators. The
teacher educators were asked: What do you think about the potential of AI for teacher education?”
(See Appendix 1 for the GenAI output). As the GenAI themes did not match the researchers’ coding (see
alterations. The GenAI analysis identified overarching valence themes (awareness and acceptance,
challenges and concerns) that the researchers perceived as sub-themes of AI literacy, didactics, and
assessment. The valence themes could also be expected due to the phrasing of the open-ended question.
Furthermore, it identified the theme integration and professional development, which seemed to combine
multiple themes. Therefore, the researchers prompted the chatbot again to produce a more detailed
analysis of this theme (prompt: “Theme 3 (Integration and professional development) is very broad.
Please analyze if this theme can be divided into more specific themes.”). The second iteration of the
GenAI analysis supported the researchers’ initial thematic analysis with the theme AI-enhanced teaching
practices combining AI didactics and assessment. The theme teacher education and professional
development fit the researchers’ AI literacy theme in scope. After considering the GenAI analysis, the
researchers again decided to keep AI assessment a separate theme as teacher educators indicated more
urgency regarding assessment in comparison to didactics. Concerning the researchers’ AI literacy theme
and the GenAI theme, teacher education and professional development made apparent a difference in
focus between the analyses. The GenAI analysis focused on what teacher educators require for AI
literacy, while the researchers emphasize AI literacy as a theme with professional development as a
supporting factor. However, the GenAI analysis also highlighted collaboration and knowledge-sharing
that the researchers had overlooked. Due to the rapid developments in the field of AI, formal professional
development may not suffice and make informal collaboration and knowledge-sharing necessary.
Therefore, the researchers incorporated this component into the AI literacy theme. Though the GenAI
analysis had definite shortcomings by focusing stronger on surface features or providing excerpts that
did not fully fit themes it had generated, the researchers considered supporting the thematic analysis with
GenAI as extremely beneficial as it forced them to question their themes and defend them in light of the
GenAI themes. Hence, this analytical step increases the rigor and objectiveness of the thematic analysis
making it more trustworthy (Morgan, 2023).

5.2 Qualitative analyses
5.2.1 Perceptions of the potential of AI for teacher education
The first thematic analysis revealed three distinct themes: AI literacy, AI didactics, and AI assessment.
In general, teacher educators’ perceptions ranged between extremely negative views, neutral acceptance,
and positive assertions. When commenting on AI in teacher education, participants expressed mixed
emotions stating that they were “curious and concerned” or find it “interesting and scary”. Other teacher
educators view it clearly negative emphasizing that AI “should be avoided as far as possible” or that they
are “concerned about AI's dumbing down of education - that it becomes a ‘sausage factory’, where AI
churns out generic texts, lesson plans, and analyses”. On the contrary, some educators show positive
anticipation stating that “It will be exciting how AI can support and challenge education”. However,
teacher educators acknowledge that AI will impact teacher education and, therefore, needs to be
thoughtfully implemented or as one educator stated:
AI affects all societal practices, including education and especially teacher education. It is unavoidable
and already happening, so for me, the influence is not potential; it is already there. We must be clear about
which parts of our profession are essential to "safeguard" from AI and which parts can appropriately meet
the profession in particularly planned ways. We must understand AI both as an Ed-tech and as a Tech-ed
phenomenon.
Overall, these assertions suggest that teacher educators are still in the early stages of navigating how to
integrate AI into teacher education, and that this process is ongoing and evolving.
The thematic analysis reflected this concerning the three themes. Teacher educators perceive
different areas of teacher education (literacy, didactics, assessment) impacted to varying degree by AI.
AI literacy was perceived as a necessary base to adjust teacher education programs to the AI age,
however, was focused on less than AI didactics and AI assessment. Teacher educators perceived that
they are forced to take AI into account concerning assessment but not necessarily regarding didactics.
AI literacy
It became evident from teacher educators’ answers that they perceive AI literacy as a central element of
future teacher education, both for pre-service teachers and teacher educators. As one teacher educator
highlighted, “AI has great potential, and both I and the students need to learn to relate to and use AI
where it makes sense. It is necessary to maintain a critical view of AI for both me and my students.”. The
ability to critically interact with AI tools is a common theme across teacher educators’ responses and is
directly linked to AI didactics. ”Integrating AI into education (which I certainly think we should) places
great demands on how we organize teaching and learning so that students do not just put a prompt into
ChatGPT to answer a teacher-set task. So critical use of AI is essential.” Teacher educators also
highlighted the need to “collaborate on AI in teacher education” and to “have an open and inclusive
culture in teacher education, so we can approach AI critically and share knowledge”. Hence, AI tools are
constantly evolving making an informal knowledge-sharing culture necessary so that teacher educators
stay up to date. A teacher educator also emphasized that pre-service teachers need to be AI literate to
responsibly take on their roles as future multipliers of knowledge:
In a democratic society where AI (probably) will play a big role, all elementary school students should
learn to interact with AI in a constructive and critical way that supports their deep learning and
opportunities to express themselves personally, appropriately, and creatively. This requires teacher
students to work critically with the technology - to experience AI's possibilities and limitations.
AI didactics
In their responses, teacher educators often touched upon how teacher education needs to rethink its
approach to teaching and learning. Teacher educators ascribed AI a transformative power. As one teacher
educator highlighted, “People are rushing around and are afraid of cheating in exams, but it requires a
completely different focus to educate students”. Hence, while the focus for many educators lies on areas
such as assessment that are directly affected by the possibilities of AI tools, teacher education will need
to adjust as a whole. As one teacher educator states, “There is a great need for us to develop a didactic
approach to using AI”. However, teacher educators see that AI tools already enable new ways of learning
by using them to aid in developing teaching ideas, function as sparring or dialogue partners in planning
teaching, or “create learning experiences where teacher students can practice classroom scenarios and
gain practical experience in a ‘playful’ environment”. Yet, teacher educators also perceive negative
aspects of AI integration. They emphasize that it challenges the traditional understanding of learning and
“accelerates the movement away from basic skills”. Thus, teacher educators need to develop new ways
to ensure basic skills are acquired despite pre-service teachers engaging with AI tools. While most see a
need in rethinking teacher education didactics, one teacher educator stated that they “do not think it has
much impact yet. It is on the periphery […]”.
AI assessment
Teacher educators felt most strongly about the impact AI has on assessment practices partially
questioning the future of written exams entirely. “How should we construct written exams in the future
(if we should continue having them at all) so that they are meaningful?” While it is a common theme in
teacher educators’ responses that they “need to rethink some of the ‘old-fashioned’ assignment and exam
formats”, two distinct approaches to this process of rethinking can be observed. Some teacher educators
consider designing exams in a way that exclude the possibility of AI use or testing pre-service teachers’
knowledge acquisition differently. Others encourage the use of AI and think there is “a need to
incorporate it into exams in the future”, possibly as an “active collaborator” in the assessment task.
5.2.2 Teacher educators’ perceptions of essential AI knowledge for pre-service teachers
The second thematic analysis revealed that teacher educators concentrated on two overarching AI literacy
domains but also mentioned a third. Dominant themes were AI literacy for teaching with AI tools (AI as
a teaching tool) and AI literacy for teaching about AI (AI as teaching content). A third theme emerged
that focuses on pre-service teachers’ requiring AI literacy to anticipate the unintended use of AI tools by
students (AI as a learning tool).
In their responses, teacher educators often touched upon that pre-service teachers require
knowledge on how AI tools work that enables them to use it for their own teaching but also to teach their
students about proper usage. Hence, teacher educators often drew on the interplay between knowledge
components concerning AI as a teaching tool, as content, and as a learning tool. This shows how the
integration of AI into education differs from most prior technologies. At the same time, teachers need to
use it for their own teaching, anticipate student use, and be able to teach about it.
AI as a teaching tool and AI as teaching content
First and foremost, teacher educators assessed that technological knowledge about how AI tools work is
a prerequisite for technological pedagogical knowledge, i.e., knowledge about how AI tools can support
teaching and learning. As one teacher educator emphasized, “My students [pre-service teachers] must
understand what AI can do, what it cannot, and how to best use it in their work as teachers.” This involves
not only knowledge about the functionality of AI tools and the effective integration into teaching, but
also taking the broader societal and democratic context into consideration. Hence, pre-service teachers
need to be aware that their use of AI tools in the classroom will also have impact outside the educational
sphere.
The interplay of knowledge components in relation to society is, for example, highlighted by a
teacher educator writing:
It is most important to understand the challenges that AI brings. It is crucial for future professional
bachelor students to understand and take care of what AI can be beneficially used for and what it should
not be used for, such as in a learning context. AI will eventually become a democratic issue, and
professional bachelors will have significant influence on how this democratic issue is managed in their
professions.
Therefore, a large number of teacher educators emphasizes that future teachers require critical thinking
skills concerning ethical challenges. As a teacher educator phrases it, “Teacher students should be
educated in the ethical use of AI in educational environments, including handling privacy, bias, and
security issues.”, pre-service teachers need to develop “a critical-constructive mindset when encountering
AI” or be critical and take into account “ethical considerations about its cultural significance”.
When teachers need to educate their students concerning AI, their technological knowledge shifts
to content knowledge about AI. This content knowledge is required to guide students to “work creatively
and constructively with AI”. As one teacher educator warns, pre-service teachers will need to “teach
students to use it [AI tools] correctly – we must not end up with another ‘digital natives’ fiasco where
we fail to address technology and do not provide children with the skills to navigate it”.
However, appropriate integration of AI into teaching does not only require knowledge about AI.
Teacher educators also highlighted that strong content knowledge of their teaching subjects is crucial to
interact with AI tools and judge the quality of their output. “They have no control over AI’s output – they
must always be able to assess it by relying on their professionalism. They must still know all the subject-
specific and pedagogical theories and be able to apply them in practice.” Pre-service teachers need to be
able to “evaluate whether the output a machine provides is ethically and professionally sound”.
AI as a learning tool
Although only few teacher educators touch on it, some emphasize that pre-service teachers require AI
literacy because they “will enter a school context where students use AI”. Therefore, they need to be
prepared to “navigate a world where students can also use” AI tools. These responses indicate that future
teachers need to take into account that students may use AI tools in their school tasks although they were
not implemented in the task by the teacher or have not been taught to use and assess the tools by the
teacher. Thus, AI literacy is needed to anticipate the unintended or possible use of AI tools by students.
6 Discussion
The study explored teacher educators’ perceptions of the potential impact of AI on teacher education and
their perceptions of what knowledge pre-service teachers required. Additionally, factors (intrinsic
motivation, confidence, use of AI for teaching) contributing to their perceptions of the potential of AI
were analyzed. Thematic analysis revealed distinct themes concerning the potential impact (AI literacy,
AI didactics, AI assessment) and AI literacy domains (AI as a teaching tool, AI as a learning tool, AI as
teaching content). Furthermore, teacher educators’ use of AI for teaching was a crucial mediating factor
in their perceptions of the potential impact of AI.
Concerning the potential impact of AI on teacher education, our results indicate that teacher
educators' views of AI range from extremely negative, to neutral, to positive. This is consistent with
research showing four distinct profiles of higher education teachers’ perceptions of the benefits and
challenges of AI-based tools for teaching and learning: optimistic, critical, critically reflective, and
neutral (Mah & Groß, 2024). However, Mah & Groß’ (2024) study analyzed higher education teachers’
perceptions across disciplines, while our study focuses on teacher educators. Furthermore, this supports
Moorhouse and Kohnke’s (2024) finding that teacher educators in general acknowledge that GenAI will
have a significant impact on teacher education.
The mediation analyses revealed that intrinsic motivation and confidence significantly predicted
teacher educators’ use of AI for teaching. The use of AI for teaching fully mediated the relationship
between intrinsic motivation or confidence and teacher educators’ perceptions. These findings concur
with prior research that shows that educators’ attitudes toward AI are influenced by their familiarity with
and understanding of its functionalities (Zhai, 2024; Kaplan-Rakowski et al., 2023). Deci and Ryan
(2000) underline the importance of intrinsic motivation to foster engagement and curiosity. Our results
are in line with this, as they show, that educators are more likely to use AI when they hold more intrinsic
motivation for learning about AI. Furthermore, studies show that institutional support and educators’
confidence play crucial roles in AI acceptance and integration (Mah & Groß, 2024; Ofosu-Ampong,
2024; Moorhouse & Kohnke, 2024). Our study extends these findings, indicating that educators who are
confident in using AI tools not only adopt them more readily but also develop a more positive perception
of their educational potential. As there is evidence that a lack of knowledge and resources hinders AI
integration (McGrath et al., 2023), our findings emphasize that institutions should promote professional
development courses concerning AI. Educators who have worked with AI tools often gain practical
insights into their capabilities, enabling them to overcome initial concerns (Zimmerman, 2006). Hence,
our findings support that professional development courses should offer hands-on experiences in trying
out AI tools for classroom practice and at the same time foster teacher educators’ intrinsic motivation
and enhance their confidence. However, results from the first thematic analysis also indicate that teacher
educators’ see a need for informal learning opportunities for knowledge-sharing on AI. Building AI
literacy in a collaborative manner can serve to mitigate the negative impact of anxiety and discomfort in
AI integration and can help teacher educators continuously gain knowledge in a constantly evolving
environment (Yang et al., 2025).
As teacher educators play a crucial role as multipliers, their perceptions could have significant
influence on how future teacher education, and consequently, teaching in schools develops (Korthagen,
2016; Moorhouse & Kohnke, 2024). The thematic analyses revealed what professional development
initiatives could focus on to enable teacher educators to take on their role as multipliers responsibly.
In our study, teacher educators saw a need to acquire sufficient knowledge and skills to critically
interact with AI tools (AI literacy), both for teacher educators and pre-service teachers. This critical
stance reflects teacher educators’ concerns of the educational and ethical implications voiced by
participants in McGrath et al.’s (2023) study but also that teacher educators see how GenAI can enhance
educational practices (e.g., Kasneci et al., 2023). It echoes Long and Magerko’s (2020) definition of AI
literacy as "a set of competencies that enable individuals to critically evaluate AI technologies” (p. 2).
As mentioned above, concurring with prior research (Mah & Groß, 2024; McGrath et al., 2023), teacher
educators see a need for professional development. Specifically, they see a need for informal forms of
professional development, focusing on collaboration and knowledge-sharing, to keep up with the rapid
development and changes in the field of GenAI. Hence, research should investigate how teacher
educators engage with informal learning opportunities or how such opportunities can be supported, for
example, with digital GenAI courses (Mah & Hense, 2021). Concurring with the literature (e.g., Jensen
et al., 2024; Kasneci et al., 2023; Moorhouse & Kohnke, 2024), teacher educators see transformative
potential in GenAI integration into their teaching (AI didactics) by creating new learning experiences for
pre-service teachers. However, they also recognize the need to develop strategies for ensuring basic
skills, reflecting concerns about students becoming overly dependent on GenAI tools (Bozkurt et al.,
2024; Tlili et al., 2023). Contrary to Moorhouse and Kohnke (2024), teacher educators did not seem fully
aware of how their didactical approaches play an important modeling role for pre-service teachers. This
may be due to teacher educators perceiving a stronger urgency to reconceptualize assessments. Thus, the
modeling effect of teacher educators should be emphasized in professional development initiatives.
Regarding assessment (AI assessment), two distinct approaches – GenAI inclusion and GenAI exclusion
– were identified. Teacher educators seemed to perceive the strongest immediate impact of GenAI in this
area. Moorhouse and Kohnke (2024) made similar findings. However, it remains uncertain whether
teacher educators have made significant progress in reconceptualizing assessment, as they still appear to
lack clear guidelines even two years after the introduction of ChatGPT. Moorhouse and Kohnke (2023)
reported this finding for data collected in April 2023, whereas our data collection occurred a year later.
This shows that clear guidelines are required for assessment in the age of artificial intelligence (e.g.,
Lodge et al., 2023). However, the prevalent focus on assessment and not teaching (AI didactics) reveals
that teacher educators do not think of teaching and assessment as intertwined. This can lead to teacher
educators concentrating too much on assessment, without taking the need to rethink their teaching into
account. This could lead to teaching that is detached from students' reality in a world where GenAI is
omnipresent. Hence, teacher education institutions need to define when assessment with or without
artificial intelligence is applicable (Dawson et al., 2024).
Teacher educators’ perceptions of required AI knowledge for pre-service teachers are likely to
impact future teacher education curricula and which components concerning AI literacy they will
integrate into their teaching. The thematic analysis revealed that teacher educators grasp the complexity
of AI literacy for future teachers. Three AI literacy themes emerged: AI as a teaching tool, AI as teaching
content, and AI as a learning tool. This triadic perspective highlights the multifaceted challenges pre-
teaching situation-specific.
The individual themes incorporated knowledge components of the TPACK model (Mishra &
Koehler, 2006) to different extents. The AI as a teaching tool theme mostly reproduces the components
of the original TPACK model. By building on technological knowledge, technological pedagogical
knowledge, and technological content knowledge, pre-service teachers need to acquire technological
pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) to effectively apply GenAI for teaching purposes. However,
the content knowledge component diverges from Mishra and Koehler’s original conceptualization by
being a necessary prerequisite to judge the quality of GenAI tool outputs. In the context of GenAI, teacher
educators also highlighted that pre-service teachers need to be able to master AI as teaching content.
Hence, the critical-constructive mindset that teachers must develop for effectively using AI as a teaching
tool should also be instilled in their students. From this perspective on teachers’ AI literacy, technological
knowledge shifts to content knowledge. Content knowledge about GenAI becomes the primary focus
supported by technological content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge. The AI literacy focus
changes again when AI is used as a learning tool by students. From this perspective teachers’ pedagogical
knowledge becomes most important in combination with technological pedagogical knowledge and
pedagogical content knowledge. Given the accessibility, versatility, and widespread use of GenAI,
teachers must anticipate that students may use GenAI tools even when the tasks assigned do not explicitly
call for them. Consequently, pre-service teachers need to develop the skills to either design learning
environments that render the use of GenAI unnecessary or implement strategies to mitigate potential
negative impacts of GenAI use in educational contexts. However, this AI literacy perspective was only
mentioned by few teacher educators. Yet, this is an important perspective to take into account and needs
to be highlighted for pre-service teachers in professional development courses. Otherwise, this could
result in a negative impact at school level, if future teachers believe they do not require any AI literacy
because they do not use or teach AI tools themselves (e.g., AI as a teaching tool, AI as content). The AI
as a learning tool perspective emphasizes the necessity of AI literacy for all teachers.
All three perspectives on AI literacy in the teaching profession (teaching tool, teaching content,
learning tool) are framed by ethical, cultural, democratic context. This aligns and extends Celik’s (2023b)
intelligent TPACK model. While Celik focuses on the ethical dimension, teacher educators additionally
highlighted the cultural and democratic dimensions that need to be included in a critical stance on GenAI.
Hence, these contextual knowledge components need to guide all GenAI teaching and learning in the
classroom. In sum, the findings highlight the complexity of AI literacy in the teaching profession and the
necessity to take all perspectives into account to prepare pre-service teachers for the challenges posed by
GenAI in education. While most teacher educators recognize the need for pre-service teachers to acquire
AI literacy regarding AI as a teaching tool and content, AI literacy concerning AI as a learning tool must
also become a key focus on teacher educators’ agenda. Contrary to the UNESCO (2024) competency
framework, this especially includes AI literacy to anticipate the unintended use of GenAI tools by
students in the learning process.
6.1 Limitations & Future Research
While this study offers valuable contributions, it also has several limitations that future research should
consider. First, the sample size, though representative of all Danish university colleges offering teacher
education, was small. Although our response rate is comparable to similar open survey studies (e.g.,
Byman et al., 2020), response bias might have led to an overrepresentation of educators with strong
opinions about AI – whether positive or negative – potentially skewing the results. Second, while the
cross-sectional design allows for examining correlations, it inherently limits causal inferences and does
not capture changes over time. Nevertheless, at this exploratory stage of educational GenAI research, we
deem this approach appropriate for providing a broad overview of teacher educators’ perceptions,
offering valuable baseline insights. Future studies employing longitudinal designs could build on these
findings to explore how perceptions of (Gen)AI evolve dynamically over time. Third, the use of broad
open-ended questions facilitated the capture of diverse perspectives in the qualitative part of the study.
While we perceive it a key strength offering a comprehensive understanding of the landscape at this
early-stage, future studies could adopt more extensive qualitative approaches (e.g., semi-structured
interviews) to explore specific themes in greater depth, even if this requires focusing on a smaller number
of educators. Such a progression would complement the broader insights gained here. Finally, this study
was conducted exclusively within Danish teacher education institutions, which operate in a highly
digitalized socio-cultural and educational context. While this focus may limit the generalizability of the
findings to countries with differing educational systems, it is interesting to note that our results echo the
findings from other educational contexts (e.g., general higher education). By addressing these limitations,
future research can refine and build on the insights presented, contributing to a deeper and more
comprehensive understanding of teacher educators’ engagement with AI.
6.2 Conclusion
This study contributes to the understanding of teacher educators’ perceptions of AI in education.
We employed a mixed-method design including the use of GenAI-enhanced thematic analysis to
investigate the perceptions of teacher educators. We found that incorporating AI enhanced support was
beneficial in terms of encouraging self-reflection on the analysis results. However, it is essential to note
that AI-enhanced methods should be used as a supplementary tool, rather than as a substitute for the
expertise of researchers (Ullman et al. 2023; Park et al., 2024).
Our findings highlight the diverse perceptions of teacher educators on GenAI, ranging from
enthusiasm for its transformative potential to apprehension regarding its challenges and implications.
Our findings align with prior research, highlighting the need to build teacher educators’ AI literacy (e.g.,
McGrath et al., 2023; Moorhouse & Kohnke, 2024). The mediation analyses revealed the importance of
teacher educators personal use of GenAI in teaching. Therefore, teacher education institutions should
focus on professional development courses that offer hands-on experiences with AI tools (Rampelt et al.,
in press). However, beyond formal training, teacher education institutions must also explore strategies to
implement informal, collaborative knowledge-sharing opportunities. These are necessary for
continuously fostering critical, ethical, and reflective engagement with GenAI (AI literacy). Our findings
further indicate that teacher educators recognize GenAI’s potential to transform teaching practices (AI
didactics) by creating innovative learning opportunities. However, they also emphasize the importance
of safeguarding basic skill acquisition. Furthermore, the urgent need to reconceptualize assessments
emerged as a key theme (AI assessment). Hence, teacher education institutions need to provide clear
guidelines for the use of GenAI in assessments to prevent a disconnect between teaching practices and
the learning realities of students in the GenAI-era (Lodge et al., 2023; Dawson et al., 2024).
Finally, this study emphasizes the multifaceted nature of AI literacy. Extending on the
conceptualizations of Mishra et al. (2006) and Celik (2023b), teacher educators indicated that pre-service
teachers need to acquire multiple AI literacies – AI as a teaching tool, AI as content, and AI as a learning
tool – all framed within ethical, cultural, democratic boundaries. Especially the possibly unintended use
of GenAI by students highlights the necessity of AI literacy for all teachers, regardless of their
willingness to implement GenAI in their classrooms. By addressing these interconnected dimensions,
institutions can prepare both teacher educators and pre-service teachers to critically and confidently
engage with GenAI, ensuring its integration aligns with educational and societal values (Bećirović &
Mattoš, 2024; Ifenthaler et al., 2024).
