Psychobiological, Environmental, and Cognitive Perspectives on the
Development of Borderline Personality Disorder: An Analysis of a
High-Capacity Individual in an Invalidating Context
J. Hernán Scalabrini O. hscalabriniortiz@gmail.com
Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by persistent emotional, cognitive, and rela-
tional instability, accompanied by difficulties integrating internal representations with external evi-
dence. Although BPD is clinically heterogeneous, there is growing interest in understanding how it
develops in individuals with high cognitive capacity and creativity who have been exposed to invali-
dating and traumatic environments. This article analyzes the case of a healthcare professional special-
izing in child neurodevelopment at a renowned institution, who exhibits signs of BPD and has a per-
sonal history marked by invalidating family relationships, sexual trauma by a physician, and politi-
cally restrictive environments. We integrate current scientific evidence regarding neurobiological,
cognitive, social, and environmental factors related to BPD, paying particular attention to dopaminer-
gic modulation, predictive coding, and environmental adversity. The analysis highlights the impor-
tance of considering the role of intellectual and creative capacity in BPD development within adverse
and invalidating contexts and underscores the need for tailored therapeutic approaches to recalibrate
internal-external integration.
