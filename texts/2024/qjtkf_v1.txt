Abstract
Cultural differences in cognition, including visual perception and long-term
memory, are influenced by the spatial scale of visual stimuli. The impact of
culture varies depending on whether the stimuli are presented at large or
small spatial scale. We tested North American and East Asian young
adults to determine whether such cultural differences extend to short-term
memory. Test materials were images of natural and constructed scenes
whose spatial structure could be altered by low-pass filtering. Several
seconds after briefly viewing a target scene, a subject saw three versions
of that scene: the target itself and two variants whose low-pass filtering
differed from the target. From these three, the subject selected the image
identical to the target.o The two groups did not differ in overall recognition
22 r
accuracy but did in the way they mistook non-matching images for certain
targets. Specifically, North American subjects made significantly fewer
25 errors in matching images whose high-frequency content was intact,
providing evidence that cultural differences in prioritization of high spatial
frequency information extend to short-term memory. Across both groups,
29 subjects were highly accurate at recognizing images that retained all or
most of their high-spatial frequency content and were highly sensitive to
different levels of spatial filtering. These findings show that visual memory
32 w
33 has sufficient fidelity to support fine discrimination of variation in spatial
frequency.

Introduction
Differences in genes (Chiao, 2011), norms, practices, and physical
environments contribute to cultural differences in various forms of
cognition (Gutchess & Sekuler, 2019). Among other effects, these
differences impact visual processing and, therefore, affect memory for
what was seen. Recent studies revealed cultural differences in processing
at different levels of thoe visual hierarchy (e.g., Blais et al., 2021). The
22 r
information in most visual images spans a range of spatial frequencies
whose processing can be selectively modulated by expectations and other
29 top-down factors (Flevaris et al., 2011; Groen, Silson, & Baker, 2017;
Shulman & Wilson, 1987; Sowden & Schyns, 2006). The potential for top-
32 w
down control over the use of different spatial frequency channels could
37 produce differences across cultures in which frequency bands tend to be
prioritized. For example, psychophysical studies with images of faces
showed that East Asians tend to prioritize low spatial frequency
45 information, which is associated with coarser, more global information,
whereas Westerners tend to prioritize higher spatial frequency information
associated with fine details and local features (Caldara, Zhou, & Miellet,
2010; Estéphan et al., 2018; Im et al., 2017; Kelly, Miellet, & Caldara,
2010; Miellet, Vizioli, He, Zhou, & Caldara, 2013; Rodger, Kelly, Blais, &
Caldara, 2010; Tardif et al., 2017; Blais, Linnell, Caparos, & Estéphan,

2021). Tests with lower-level stimuli, such as sinusoidal gratings or Gabor
patches, produce a different outcome. In particular, the contrast sensitivity
functions of Caucasian and East Asian subjects seem not to differ (Tardif
et al., 2017), and N1 and P3 cortical potentials evoked by Gabor patches
of higher or lower spatial frequencies are similar for Americans and East
Asians (Lin, Zhang, Fields, Sekuler, & Gutchess, 2022). This latter null
result is important becoause both these cortical potentials are known to
22 r
exhibit strong spatial frequency dependence.
Accurate memory for visual stimuli requires that image content be
29 processed and maintained in memory with minimal loss. Particularly when
the memory assay involves recognition or match to sample, performance
32 w
depends upon the quality of additional processing steps, including
37 retrieval. To produce sensitive tests of visual memory accuracy, we
generated stimuli whose spatial content had been filtered to a relatively
small degree. We used these challenging materials to examine possible
45 cultural effects in visual memory, an ability that occupies the intersection
of perceptual and mnemonic processes (e.g., Bainbridge, 2019). Previous
research showed cultural differences in long-term visual memory (for
reviews, see Gutchess & Sekuler, 2019; Wang, 2021). Because errors in
visual memory can occur even after very short time delays, on the order of
seconds or less (Atkins & Reuter- Lorenz, 2008; Huang & Sekuler, 2010;
Page 5 of 46 Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
2 5
Chunharas, Rademaker, Brady, & Serences, 2022), we tested whether
cultural differences extended to visual memory on a very short-term scale
of seconds.
For test materials, we chose images of natural and constructed
scenes. Perception of scenes recruits visual processes beyond low-level
vision, such as those engaged when viewing isolated objects such as
Gabors or faces. Relaotive to other visual stimuli, a scene’s distinguishing
22 r
characteristics can be described as "a semantically coherent (and often
nameable) view of a real-world environment comprising background
29 elements and multiple discrete objects arranged in a spatially licensed
manner” (Henderson & Hollingworth, 1999). A scene’s visual content
32 w
spans a range of spatial frequencies (Blake & Sekuler, 2006), with
37 background elements usually, but not always, larger-scale and its objects
smaller-scale (Võ, 2021). Importantly, semantic representations guide
scene processing, such that attention is deployed to semantically
45 meaningful parts of scenes (Hayes & Henderson, 2023; Henderson,
Hayes, Peacock, & Rehrig, 2019; Henderson, 2020). This allows the
processing of a scene to be strongly influenced by semantic information
and viewers’ own culture-bound experiences with scenes (Biederman,
1972; Le-Hoa Võ & Wolfe, 2015; Castelhano & Williams, 2021). This idea
was supported by work using change blindness (Rensink, 2002), a
Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics Page 6 of 46
2 6
phenomenon that can be exploited to reveal how subjects distribute visual
attention over scenes. In a multi-experiment study, Masuda and Nisbett
(2006) presented East Asians and Americans with scenes in which either
local, object information or large-scale, contextual information had been
changed. The dependent measures were the subjects’ speed and
accuracy in detecting change between the two versions of the image.
Compared to Americaon subjects, East Asians more readily detected
22 r
contextual, large-scale, rather than focal, changes, suggesting culture-
based variation in how visual attention prioritizes information in a scene.
29 To examine possible cross-cultural differences in short-term memory,
we manipulated the spatial content of scenes that subjects were shown.
32 w
We defined cultural groups based on national origin, drawing on the
37 East/West differences that have been a focus of the literature (e.g., Nisbett
& Masuda, 2003). We predicted that cultural groups would differ in their
dependence upon and attention to different spatial frequency bands, with
45 Americans relying on high-spatial frequency (HSF) information relatively
more than Asians, and vice versa for low-spatial frequency (LSF)
information. Applying a low-pass spatial filter to real-world scenes can
reduce the available high-frequency content with little effect on the low-
frequency content. This led us to predict that cultural differences in visual
memory should emerge for the scenes that contain the most high-
Page 7 of 46 Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
2 7
frequency information. As the amount of high-frequency content is
reduced through filtering, the memory performance of Americans should
be impacted disproportionately compared to East Asians. These
predictions align with research showing that East Asians tend to prioritize
lower-frequency information whereas Westerners tend to prioritize higher-
frequency information (reviewed by Blais et al., 2021). Because scenes’
object-related informaotion tends to lie in higher-frequency bands, that
22 r
finding is consistent with reports that Westerners attend to objects
relatively more than East Asians (Chua, Boland, & Nisbett, 2005; Masuda
29 & Nisbett, 2001). Measures of both accuracy and confusability were
examined. Although we predicted that compared to East Asians,
32 w
Americans would have more accurate memory for images containing the
37 most high spatial frequency information.
We compared cultural groups using a short-term visual memory task
to test these predictions. Americans and East Asians viewed grayscale
45 scenes that were low-pass filtered to different degrees. The filtering
operation produced images that differ mainly in high spatial frequency
information. In the first stage of a delayed match-to-sample (DMS) design,
subjects first saw an image of a scene; then, after a random masking
stimulus and a short delay, they saw three variants of that scene, which
differed in high-frequency content. Subjects tried to identify the image that
Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics Page 8 of 46
2 8
matched the one they had seen initially. The modest spatial frequency
differences and high inter-item similarity among stimuli added to the
challenge of the subjects’ task. The perceptually similar alternatives on
each DMS trial made the task akin to a multi-class classification (Sokolova
& Lapalme, 2009). This allowed us to go beyond the measure commonly
used in DMS research, the proportion of correct matches, to examine the
precision of subjects’ oclassification at various levels of spatial filtering.
22 r
These challenging test stimulus alternatives afforded us more information
than would normally be available from a DMS design.
29 Another feature of our design manipulated the memorability of the test
images. This feature was included because research has begun to identify
32 w
which features make images memorable, including semantics, scene
37 category, color, and other intrinsic properties of stimuli (Isola, Xiao, Parikh,
Torralba, & Oliva, 2014; Bainbridge, 2019). As an ancillary to our primary
question of interest, we assessed whether scenes that vary in
45 memorability are differentially impacted by manipulations of their spatial
frequency content. Beyond testing the effects of culture, this manipulation
allowed us to assess how both spatial frequency and memorability
manipulations affect memory performance across the entire sample.

We recruited 60 subjects, 30 U.S.-born and 30 East Asian-born
Brandeis University students. All the American subjects had spent most of
their lives in the U.S.: two had spent four or fewer years living abroad, and
the rest had lived their entire lives in the U.S. The East Asian subjects had
all spent less than five years in the U.S., on average just 2.19 years (SD =
1.32) in the US and 17.88 years (SD = 1.38) in their native country (China
for 29/30, N/A for the oremaining participant). Of the Americans, ten were
22 r
male, nineteen were female, and one was non-binary/other; East Asians
included one male and 29 females. Subjects’ age range was 18-23 (M =
29 20.2, SD=2.2). Age data are missing for two East Asian subjects, and
vision measures (contrast sensitivity and logMAR, a measure of visual
32 w
acuity) are missing for one. Visual acuity was measured using the Sloan
37 ETDRS Intermediate Vision chart (at 60 cm). Contrast sensitivity was
measured using the Mars Perceptrix Letter Chat for near vision. Finally,
because of the high incidence of myopia in East Asia, including China
45 (Dolgin, 2015), we asked about the subjects’ refractive condition and
history. Self-reports indicated that 15/30 Americans and 22/29 East Asians
(data were missing for 1 participant) were nearsighted; myopic Americans
reported that they began to wear corrective lenses at M = 11.40 (SD =
3.83) years of age; myopic East Asians began at a similar age, M = 11.94

missing for one East Asian subject who failed to complete the scales. We
will return to the significance of these results in the Discussion.

Stimuli
Stimuli were 40 images of natural and indoor scenes selected from
the Scene Understanding (SUN) dataset (Xiao, Hys, Ehinger, & Oliva,
32 w
2010). The SUN database contains 131,000 images representing 908
scene categories (e.g., castle and playing field). Selection excluded
images in which a human face, body, or other identifiable living creature
appeared. Using Isola, Xiao, Torralba, and Oliva (2011)’s image
memorability metric, we selected equal numbers of high- and low-
memorability images. This allowed us to assess how image memorability
affected subjects’ performance on our task. High memorability was defined
by memorability scores > 0.7, while low memorability was defined by
scores <0.3. The lefthand column of Fig. 1 shows representative images of
both types.
Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics Page 12 of 46
2 12
Matlab’s Image Processing Toolbox converted the images to 8-bit
grayscale. Then, two variants were produced for each original grayscale
image by convolving the image with a low-pass 3×3 normalized box filter.
Each convolution reduced the high-frequency content of the image,
leaving its low-frequency content essentially unchanged. The first variant
was produced by four iterative applications of the convolution kernel; to
remove additional higho-frequency content, a second image variant was
22 r
iteratively filtered four more times, making eight convolutions. We
designate members of each trio of images as Orig, LPF4, and LPF8 for
29 the original unfiltered image and images that were iteratively low-pass
filtered four and eight times, respectively. For reference, these filtering
32 w
operations correspond closely to what would be produced by a single
37 application of Gaussian filters, with σ=2 or σ=2.83 for LPF4 and LPF8,
respectively (Gonzalez & Woods, 2017). The difference in stimulus blur
between Orig and LPF4 will be larger than between LPF4 and LPF8,
45 which should produce a corresponding perceptual difference in stimulus
discriminability (Watson & Ahumada, 2011), making some comparisons
likely more challenging for subjects than others.
Fig. 1 shows examples of four images produced by these filtering
operations. The low-pass filtering protocol, including the design of the low-
pass filter and its iterative application, was based on pilot testing with four
Page 13 of 46 Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
2 13
subjects, none of whom would serve later in our experiment. Pilot testing
identified levels of filtering that would produce accuracy well above chance
but below the upper limit of accuracy.
The plotSf function from Matlab’s SHINE toolbox shows how iterative
filtering affected image frequency content (Willenbockel et al., 2010). The
plotSf function averages the energy in an image’s 2D Fast Fourier
Transform over radial odistances. This produces an average energy per
22 r
spatial frequency expressed in cycles per image. Because images were
160×160 pixels, the theoretical limit of their frequency content (80
29 cycles/image) was well above the limit of human vision. In Fig. 2 the
reduction in each image’s high-frequency content can be gauged by the
32 w
marker on a spectrum’s x-axis intercept.

The rows show four representative stimuli categorized as high
memorability (H) and low (L). In each row, the original image and its
two low-pass variants are shown from left to right columns. The mean
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM, see below) for Orig vs. LPF4 and
LPF4 vs. LPF8 images are 0.5968 and 0.7514, showing that images in
the leftmost two columns are more different than those in the rightmost
columns.
Page 15 of 46 Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
2 15
Repeated application of the filter reduces an image’s high-frequency
content but does so with a diminishing effect over successive iterations
and has essentially no effect on the lower frequencies in the image. This
fact is reflected in the variation of the y-axis intercepts for the spectra in
Fig. 2. The y-axis intercepts associated with the lowest frequency
components are nearly invariant over filter levels. In contrast, there is a
difference in the spectoras’ x-axis intercepts between the leftmost and
22 r
middle columns, corresponding to a large difference in their images’
highest frequency content. Moreover, the x-axis intercepts in the middle
29 and rightmost columns differ slightly, signifying only a modest difference in
the images’ highest frequency content.
32 w
In images of natural scenes, higher-frequency bands, defined in cycles
37 per image, tend to carry more object-related information than lower-
frequency bands (Lieber, Lee, Majaj, & Movshon, 2023). The perceptual
similarity of images is monotonically related to the difference between their
45 spectral content, including higher-frequency content. As a result of this
differential effect of iterative low-pass filtering, the images in the left and
middle columns in each row of Fig. 1 should be more distinct than those in
the middle and right columns. To confirm this, we drew on to the widely
used Structural Similarity Index (SSIM; Wang, et al., 2004). SSIM
compares images based on luminance, contrast, and structural
Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics Page 16 of 46
2 16
information, also key components of human visual perception. When two
images are identical (copies of one another), SSIM = 1; when SSIM = 0, it
indicates that images’ structure, luminance, and contrast differ to the
extent that the algorithm cannot find any commonality. We calculated
SSIM values for each image used in the experiment, comparing for each
its Orig and LPF4 versions, and its LPF4 and LPF8 versions. The mean
and standard errors oof SSIM for Orig vs. LPF4 images were 0.647 and
22 r
0.018; for LPF4 vs. LPF8, the values were 0.788 and 0.018. A two-tailed,
paired t-test confirmed that Orig and LPF4 images were reliably more
29 distinct than LPF4 and LPF8 images (t = -6.395, df = 18, p<.001).

Subjects gave written informed consent for a protocol approved by

and contrast sensitivity were tested using the EDTRS visual acuity test
(VectorVision, Houston, TX) designed for a 60 cm test distance and the
45 Mars Letter Contrast Sensitivity Test (The Mars Perceptrix Corporation,
Chappaqua, NY). Stimuli were presented on a Dell Flat Panel LCD
Monitor (P2011HT) with a screen resolution of 1600×900 pixels (over
18.22×10.71") and a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The monitor had a constant
luminance of 35.4 cd/m2. The scenes represented in our images varied in
subject matter and mean luminance, which ranged from 21 to 55 cd/m2; at

43 target image for 2 seconds, followed by a two-second long masking
stimulus. Next, they were presented with three images that varied in
level of filtering; one was the target image. The subjects’ task was to
select the image (labeled 1, 2, or 3) that matched the image shown at
the start of the trial, taking no more than five seconds to click on the
image.

The experimental task, which was implemented in PsychoPy (Peirce et
al., 2019), entailed a delayed match-to-sample (DMS) design. Fig. 3
shows our task’s sequence of events on a trial. First, a sample target
stimulus (e.g., an image of a scene) was displayed for two seconds. A
two-second presentation of a random mask followed this. Finally, with
three variants of the target image on the display screen, a subject had to
identify the one that moatched the remembered target image. Subjects
22 r
indicated their selection by pressing the computer keyboard’s 1 key to
indicate the top image, and the 2 and 3 keys to indicate the lower left or
29 lower right image. They had up to five seconds to respond, and the
program advanced to the next trial. After each set of 10 trials, subjects
32 w
took a short self-paced break. While familiarizing themselves with the task,
37 subjects were told they would "see a scene image and be tested on [their]
memory for that exact image." They were shown a sample target image,
the masking stimulus, and examples of the three test images from which
45 they would choose the exact match to the target image. After the
instructions, subjects had two practice trials, receiving feedback after each
response. During the actual experiment, no feedback was given after a
trial.
Each subject completed 40 trials, distributed over four blocks of 10
trials each. This included approximately equal numbers of trials with the
Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics Page 20 of 46
2 20
target image at each level of spatial filtering. The 40 trials entailed
approximately equal numbers of target images at each of the three levels
of filtering (13, 14, and 13 for 0 [the original image], 4, and 8 filtering
operations, respectively); the comparison image that was the correct
match appeared approximately often in each of the three possible
positions on the screen (13 at top and bottom left, 14 at bottom right).
Blocks were presenteod in a randomized trial order, but within a block, all
22 r
subjects received target and comparison images in the same order.
29 Results
A programming error caused one image to be presented as the
32 w
standard twice, at two different levels of filtering. All analyses excluded
37 that trial, leaving 39 trials for each subject. In addition, during low-pass
filtering, one exemplar from seven of the stimuli acquired a small edge
artifact, a thin white line at one of the image’s edges.
45 We first wanted to see if memory performance with the seven
images with edge-artifact differed from performance with the other images.
Mean accuracy and 95% CIs were 0.738 [0.655, 0.821] and 0.730 [0.693,
0.766] for the seven images with artifacts and the remaining images,
respectively. The small 0.008 difference between the two means suggests
that edge artifacts did not significantly affect accuracy, so subsequent
Page 21 of 46 Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
2 21
analyses included both sets of images.
Categorization of images as high or low in memorability was based
on psychophysical estimates with full-color versions of our gray-scale
images, and assessed with a protocol quite different from ours (Isola et al.,
2014). These differences led us to entertain the possibility that the variable
might be unimportant for our results. To test that, we calculated the mean
proportion of each suboject’s correct responses for high and low
22 r
memorability test items to assess the importance of image memorability
29 A paired t-test confirmed that the difference in memorability did not reliably
impact performance (t=0.12, df =59, p= 0.9). As a result, subsequent
32 w
analyses omitted image memorability as an independent variable.

Up to this point, we have concentrated on just one component of the
38 DMS paradigm, the targetStimulus that subjects see first and must hold in
memory. Of course, the elements that constitute a trial’s multiple test
alternatives are equally important, particularly because of the relatively
46 modest perceptual differences among the alternative images (see Fig. 1).
Also, our analyses so far have concentrated on the binary categorization
of Delayed Match to Sample responses as “right” or “wrong.” Of course,
the existence of wrong responses does not tell us everything about the
underlying cause of errors; for additional information, we turned to how
Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics Page 26 of 46
2 26
errors were distributed across stimulus variants. In doing this, we exploited
perceptual similarity’s strong contribution to confusion in short-term
memory, including confusions found in previous applications of the DMS
paradigm (Yotsumoto, Kahana, Wilson, & Sekuler, 2007; Schurgin,
Wixted, & Brady, 2020; Sekuler & Sekuler, 2023). To examine how well
subjects’ performance aligns with inter-item similarity, we sorted the
proportion of responseos, correct as well as incorrect, into the 3×3 stimulus-
22 r
For both groups, correct responses are represented along the
29 matrix’s negative diagonal and are displayed in boldface; incorrect
responses fill off-diagonal cells. Note that this way of representing
32 w
subjects’ performance goes beyond the basic results expressed as
37 proportion correct. They show how incorrect responses, confusions, are
distributed among alternatives. We begin by examining the pattern of
confusion common to both groups. Interestingly, this pattern of confusion
45 parallels the images’ structural similarity (SSIM) values. Consider first
when the target image is unfiltered. Subjects rarely confuse an unfiltered
target image with either filtered test stimulus. That specific lack of
confusion mimics the dissimilarity (lower SSIM value) of unfiltered images
(Orig class) to images whose high spatial frequencies were reduced
Page 27 of 46 Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
2 27
(either LPF4 or LPF8). Jumping to the righthand column, we see that the
most strongly filtered target images (LPF8 class) are often confused with
LPF4 test images, a result that aligns with the relatively high SSIM values
between images of those two types. Finally, in the center column, we see
that LPF4 target images are less likely to be confused with Orig
alternatives than with the other (LPF8), which mimics the relative size of
SSIM values for Orig aond LPF4 images on the one hand, and those of
22 r
LPF4 and LPF8 images on the other.
Now, we turn to the differences between results for the two groups.

emerged for the stimuli containing the most high-frequency information.
37 American subjects were more accurate at correctly recognizing high-
frequency stimuli (Orig) than were East Asian subjects; in contrast, East
Asians tended to mistakenly select medium-frequency (LPF4) stimuli as
45 matching high-frequency (Orig) stimuli. These differences are consistent
with the idea that cultural groups differ in their dependence upon and
attention to different spatial frequency bands (Tardif et al., 2017; Blais et
al., 2021), with Americans utilizing higher spatial frequency information
relatively more than East Asians and vice versa for lower spatial frequency
information.

41 Discussion
Before examining differences between our North American and East
Asian subjects, it is essential to consider how the spatial structure of
49 images influences short-term visual memory. Our findings demonstrate
that subjects were highly accurate in recognizing target images that
retained most of their high-spatial frequency content, as seen in the
accuracy for Orig and LPF4 images (Fig. 4). These results align with
Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics Page 30 of 46
2 30
previous studies showing highly accurate memory for visual stimuli (Brady
et al., 2008; Standing, 1973). Remarkably, in our study, high-fidelity
memory representations were generated from target images viewed for
just two seconds and then masked.
In contrast, performance declined significantly for target images that
underwent the most lowpass filtering (LPF8), with a mean proportion
correct of only 0.46, boarely above the chance level of 0.33. Despite the
22 r
seemingly subtle differences in high-frequency content between LPF4 and
29 SSIM values and were sufficient to produce distinct patterns of confusion.
These findings indicate that short-term visual memory for scenes is
32 w
sensitive to spatial filtering, with modest variations in test images leading
37 to reliable effects on memory.
Cultural Differences in Reliance on Spatial Frequency Information.
Our study also explored whether cultural differences impact short-term
45 memory for spatial frequency content, drawing on the idea that
Westerners prioritize higher-spatial frequency information more than
Easterners (Blais et al., 2021). We hypothesized that Americans would
outperform East Asians in remembering images with high-spatial
differences occur: Americans were significantly more accurate than East
Page 31 of 46 Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
2 31
Asians in recognizing unfiltered Orig scenes. However, this advantage
disappeared for LPF4 and LPF8 images, suggesting that top-down factors,
including cultural influences, contribute to how spatial frequency
information is utilized (Flevaris et al., 2011; Shulman & Wilson, 1987;
Sowden & Schyns, 2006).
Although our findings extend previous research on cultural
differences in prioritiziong spatial frequency content (Caldara, Zhou, &
22 r
Miellet, 2010; Estéphan et al., 2018; Im et al., 2017; Kelly, Miellet, &
Caldara, 2010; Miellet, Vizioli, He, Zhou, & Caldara, 2013; Rodger, Kelly,
29 Blais, & Caldara, 2010; Tardif et al., 2017; Blais, Linnell, Caparos, &
Estéphan, 2021) to short-term memory tasks involving scenes, these
32 w
cultural differences were modest compared to the effects of lowpass
37 spatial filtering, regardless of subjects’ cultural background. One possible
cause of this effect is that detailed, high-frequency information is critical for
identifying specific objects and understanding a scene’s finer semantic
45 details. Although this loss would have a negligible effect on the ability to
extract a scene’s gist (Oliva and Torralba, 2001), it becomes important in a
challenging situation like ours, when subjects are confronted with a test
array in which all alternatives share the same gist. Under those conditions,
the availability of high-frequency information is critical (Lowe, 2004).

Limitations and Considerations. Several factors may have limited
our study's relatively modest cultural differences. Our East Asian subjects
were international students studying in the United States, and living
abroad, even for an average of two years, may have shifted their cultural
orientation toward a more North American perspective. How did the time
the East Asian subjects spent in the West and their experiences there
influence their percepotual and attentional strategies? We tried to restrict
22 r
East Asian subjects’ degree of acculturation to the US by restricting our
sample to people who had lived no more than five years outside their
29 home country. However, for young adults like our subjects, five years is a
large fraction of their whole lives. So, future research could profitably
32 w
examine whether a shorter residence in the West would boost the
37 difference in reliance on high-frequency details and whether a far longer
residence would eliminate the difference. Of course, the amount of time
spent outside one’s home country is just one factor contributing to an
45 individual’s degree of acculturation. That time-based measure is mute
about the intensity of exposure to and engagement with Western
influences —such as films, websites, and everyday visual materials— all
of which could affect the cultural biases in local versus global attention
reported in previous studies. Examining individual differences in how
acclimating to a new culture affects cognition is a promising direction for
Page 33 of 46 Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
2 33
future research, extending research on the use of long-term memory
strategies (Gilliam & Gutchess, 2025) to investigate visual and short-term
memory processes.
Additionally, individuals who self-select to study abroad might
already share values and cultural orientations similar to Americans
(Kitayama et al., 2006). Notably, there were no significant differences
between our groups ino basic visual measures, such as visual acuity and
22 r
contrast sensitivity, reducing the likelihood that initial visual processing
differences contributed to the observed results. However, the exact factors
29 promoting the group differences remain unclear. Possible explanations
include differences in visual environments or cultural factors like
32 w
congenital myopia, which could influence visual attention habits (Gutchess
37 & Sekuler, 2019).
Effects of Memorability on Performance. Our study also examined
the impact of image memorability on performance, as defined by prior
did not significantly affect performance, potentially because our stimuli
were grayscale images, whereas original memorability scores were based
on full-color images. Furthermore, the short time interval between target
and test images in our protocol (a few seconds) may have minimized the
impact of memorability, as defined by Isola et al. (2011) with a different
Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics Page 34 of 46
2 34
protocol and much longer retention intervals. This suggests that image
memorability may not be as influential in short-term visual memory tasks
where test items are nearly identical to the target images, apart from
lowpass filtering.
Future Directions. Future research could extend these findings by
exploring the effects of spatial filtering and cultural influences over longer
memory delays, as meomory’s spatial frequency content is known to
22 r
change over time (Harvey, 1986). Additionally, testing the impact of
filtering lower or medium spatial frequencies could provide further insights
29 into the role of spatial frequency information in memory and how this may
vary across cultures. Continuing to investigate the basis for cultural effects
32 w
is crucial, especially given our findings that individual differences in self-
37 construal or reasoning styles did not account for the observed cultural
differences. Exploring the influence of perceptual affordances and scene
content, such as the number of objects in different environments
45 (Miyamoto, Nisbett, & Masuda, 2006), could shed light on how a culture’s
physical environment shapes perceptual biases and memory.
Conclusion. In conclusion, this research establishes that short-term
visual memory preserves detailed spatial frequency content, allowing
perceptual distinctions to follow very small changes. Memory performance
was significantly poorer for images with more lowpass filtering; images
Page 35 of 46 Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics
2 35
filtered the most were rarely confused with unfiltered originals. These
findings underscore the importance of spatial structure in short-term visual
memory and highlight the role of cultural influences, albeit modestly, in
shaping memory for visual scenes.
