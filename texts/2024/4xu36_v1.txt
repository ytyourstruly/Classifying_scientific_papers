Abstract
Determinants of regional foreign direct investment inflows in China from 2008 to 2019 are analysed in terms of
the progress of the marketisation such as non-state-owned sectors’ share of output, investment and employment,
the state of price controls in commodity markets, the state of development of factor markets such as finance and
labour, and the state of development of the institutional system supporting the market economy system.
Additionally, human capital development, infrastructure development and industrial structure are incorporated as
control variables. Key results of the analysis of China’s regional FDI inflows include: 1) the progress of
marketisation had a positive impact; 2) an increase in per capita GDP had a positive impact, and 3) the increase in
the ratio of the secondary industry to GDP had a negative impact, while the tertiary industry had a positive impact.
This result reflects the ongoing shift from vertical FDI in export-oriented labour-intensive manufacturing
industries to horizontal FDI oriented toward sales to the local market.
Keywords: Foreign Direct Investment, Absorb Capacity, Marketisation
1. Introduction
China has achieved rapid economic development since the reform and opening-up policy implemented in 1978.
One of the driving forces behind this has been capital investment and foreign trade. In particular, inflows of foreign
direct investment (FDI) contributed to alleviating the “Two gaps,” or the bottlenecks for capital investment in
developing countries, namely constraints on domestic savings and constraints on foreign exchange reserves used
for importing capital goods. FDI inflows also brought about the transfer of advanced technology and business
management practices.
We will focus China’s regional FDI inflows from 2008 to 2019 to China’s 22 provinces, five ethnic autonomous
regions, and four direct-administered municipalities (excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau; hereinafter
collectively referred to as “provinces” for brevity). This paper employs a panel data analysis of the determinants
of FDI inflows.
In considering the determinants of FDI inflows in each province, this paper focuses on the degree of progress in
each province’s transition to a market economy. A characteristic of FDI into China since the 1980s is the coastal

export-oriented, labour-intensive manufacturing industry, which invests in the Pearl River Delta centred on
Guangdong Province and the Yangtze River Delta around Shanghai. Due to structural diversification, since the
2000s, there has been an expansion of investment destinations, including expansion into inland areas and an
expansion of industrial sectors, especially services sector. Against the backdrop of these changes in FDI inflows
to China, the factors that determine the investment destination for FDI in China go beyond simple wage levels and
preferential treatment provided to foreign companies by local governments. Instead, the socio-economic
development level of the province and the progress of institutional reform that is more conducive to business
activities will become important.
Based on these issues, in order to analyse the determinants of FDI inflows by provinces in China, Fan et al. (2019)
compared the development level of the market economy in each province in China from a comprehensive and
unified perspective by producing “China Marketization Index (CMI).” Each province’s per capita GDP growth
rate, education level, and industrial structure are employed as control variables.
As contributions of this paper, the key results of the analysis revealed that 1) the progress of the market economy
as measured by the CMI has a positive impact on FDI inflows, 2) the increase in GDP per capita has a positive
impact, and 3) looking at the industrial structure, the increase in the ratio of secondary industries to GDP has had
a negative impact, but has had a positive impact on tertiary industries.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a review of the existing literature covering the
topics of determinants of regional FDI inflows. Section 3 presents the analysis method and data, followed by the
Results of the analysis in Section 4. Section 5 concludes this paper with key findings and prospects in light of the
latest development of China’s external economic relations.
2. Review of existing literature
2.1 Theoretical and empirical studies on determinants of FDI location
The starting point is the Eclectic Paradigm of International Production or the OLI (Ownership, Location and
Internalization) framework proposed by Dunning (Dunning, 1981). Regarding location, the critical determinant is
the advantage of producing at the investment destination rather than to produce and export in one’s own country.
Location advantages include 1) market factors such as size, growth potential, proximity with customers and
existing market structure; 2) trade factors such as trade barriers and consumer preferences for imported goods; 3)
cost factors such as raw material procurement cost, labour cost, and logistics cost, and 4) investment environments
such as political stability and regulatory framework of FDI in the investment destination.
Furthermore, since the 2000s, the importance of natural resources and low wages, which were considered
determining factors in the selection of FDI destinations by multinational companies, has decreased in line with the
growth of FDI to emerging countries due to economic globalisation. It has been pointed out that instead, emphasis
has been placed on the political stability of the investment destination, the quality of the institution, and the policy
settings aimed at creating a competitive environment for business (Batschauer Da Cruz et al., 2022; Dunning,
2002; Mudambi & Mudambi, 2002; Nielsen et al., 2018; Peres et al., 2018).
Institutions have the capacity to address market imperfections, thereby enhancing the efficacy of market economic
structures. Institutions are the primary intangible production factor, including legal, political, and administrative
systems, and institutional cost constitutes the attractiveness of an FDI location. Transaction costs in certain
locations could be affected due to the presence of these institutions (Nielsen et al., 2018).
On the empirical front specific to China, Belkhodja et al. (2017) conducted a study on the operations of foreign
investors in China whose data was obtained in 2009. The regression analyses revealed that the likelihood of foreign
investors investing was augmented by factors such as infrastructure development, intellectual property rights
protection, and educational investments. Hou et al. (2021) examined the determinants of China’s regional FDI
inflows from 1993 to 2014. Their modelling exercise concluded that regions that had larger local markets, broader
Asian Institute of Research Economics and Business Quarterly Reviews Vol.7, No.4, 2024
infrastructure stock of roads and railways, lower growth rate of labour cost, a higher level of openness, larger
government expenditure per regional GDP and better human capital availability measured by the stock of high
school graduates attracted more FDI inflows to region.
Existing studies on determinants of regional FDI inflows in China since the 2000s include wage costs, human
resources, capital formation and local government policies. Among these, the explanatory variables related to the
policy framework of local governments are limited, such as the ratio of local fiscal expenditure to GDP and tax
incentives for companies within the province (local corporate tax/local tax revenue). This study attempts to
examine the impacts of the local government’s policy framework, in particular, the progress of marketisation in
each of China’s provinces.
2.2 Indicators of the progress of the market economy in each province in China
In order to compare the progress of marketized economy in China’s each province from a comprehensive and
unified perspective, Fan et al.(2019) produced the“China Marketization Index (CMI),” a composite index by an

The CMI has been revised almost every year, and the latest version is for the year 2021. The CMI has been widely
used to examine the impact of marketisation on regional economic growth regarding resource allocation efficiency.
Chen et al. (2021) examined the relationship between economic development and the marketisation level in the
western region of China whose progress was measured by the CMI. The regression analysis from 2003 to 2017
confirmed that the progress of marketisation in China’s western region promoted economic development
significantly. The results implied that underdeveloped areas could narrow the development gap by continuously
improving the institutional framework that was conducive to promoting marketisation. Fan et al. (2019) employed
CMI and assessed the impact of market-oriented reform on total factor productivity (TFP) of China’s provinces.
They concluded that in the period from 1997 to 2014, market-oriented reforms contributed 1.3 percentage points
to China’s annual GDP growth rate and accounted for 35% of the increase in TFP. Li et al. (2017) argued that
foreign pharmaceutical companies’ selection of investment destinations in China from 2004 to 2014 was
influenced by the per capita GDP growth rate of the target province and the level of marketisation measured by
Asian Institute of Research Economics and Business Quarterly Reviews Vol.7, No.4, 2024
the CMI. The results implied that the progress of marketisation reduces potential transaction costs stemming from
the unpredictability of the institutional system of the investment destination.
Inspired by these existing literature, we will employ the CMI and analyse the relationship between each province’s
progress toward market economy and FDI inflows.

3.2 Methodology of the analysis
In this analysis, we use the following formulation.
𝑙𝑛𝐹𝐷𝐼 = 𝛼𝑙𝑛𝑀𝑅𝐾 + 𝛽𝑙𝑛𝑃𝐺𝐷𝑃 + 𝛾𝑙𝑛𝐸𝐷𝑈 + 𝛿𝑙𝑛𝑆𝐶𝐷 (𝑜𝑟 𝑙𝑛𝑇𝑅𝐷 ) + 𝜀

term.
For econometric analysis of the above equation, we use Panel fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) by
Philips and Moon (1999) and Panel dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) by Kao and Chiang (2000). These
methods make it possible to measure long-term equilibrium relationships between variables when there is a
cointegration relationship between the variables. In addition, in this analysis, it is necessary to consider the problem
of endogeneity caused by reverse causality between variables (e.g. lnFDI → lnPGDP). Nevertheless, these
techniques address the issue of endogeneity and serial correlation in cointegrating regressions, hence ensuring
unbiased estimations of the cointegrating coefficients. FMOLS modifies the OLS estimator by adjusting for the
asymptotic bias due to endogenous regressors. It uses non-parametric methods to account for the endogeneity
caused by the feedback between the regressors and the error term. DOLS employs a different approach by
incorporating leads and lags of the first differences of the independent variables into the regression. This inclusion
of dynamic terms helps in addressing endogeneity and serial correlation.
4. Results of analysis
In conducting analysis using FMOLS and DOLS, the first prerequisite is a unit root test for panel variables and
confirmation of the existence of a cointegration relationship.
4.1 Panel unit root test
To detect the problem of spurious correlations, the tests for panel unit root are conducted to examine the
stationarity with the null assumption that a series has a unit root. For the variables used in the panel data analysis,
the Levin, Lin & Chu (LLC) test (Levin et al., 2002), which assumes that the variables have a common unit root
across regions, follows the method commonly used in previous studies. Im, Pesaran and Shin (IPS) test (Im et al.,
2003), Fisher ADF test (Maddala and Wu, 1999) , and Fisher-PP test (Maddala and Wu, 1999), which assume that

4.2 Panel cointegration test
Next, we will conduct the Pedroni residual integration test to examine the cointegration relationship in the analysed
data, following the method commonly used in existing studies. The Panel residual integration test, which assumes
homogeneity between regions (within-dimension) in the autoregressive coefficient of the estimation residual, and
the Group test, which assumes heterogeneity (between-dimension), are proposed. A total of 11 statistics are shown
in six, which is the majority.
Furthermore, we also conducted a supplementary Kao test that assumes homogeneity between regions, but as
rejected at the level.

• Through models 1 to 4, the progress of the market economy in each province has a significant positive
impact on the regional FDI inflows.
• Growth in per capita regional GDP has a significant positive impact on regional FDI inflows.
• Looking at the effects of changes in industrial structure, an increase in the ratio of secondary industries
to GDP in each province has a negative impact on regional FDI inflows, whereas an increase in the ratio
of tertiary industries to GDP has a positive impact on that.
When considering the background of these results regarding sectoral FDI inflows during the period from 2008 to
share of the services industry has increased instead. This could be partly due to the transformation of sectoral FDI
inflows to China, reflecting the ongoing shift from vertical FDI, as seen in export-oriented labour-intensive
manufacturing industries to horizontal FDI oriented toward sales to local markets.

Furthermore, human capital, as measured by growth in education-related fiscal expenditures in each province, has
a significantly negative impact, which is inconsistent with the results of other explanatory variables, which indicate
a shift in FDI inflows to horizontal FDI. One hypothesis is that the sluggish growth in spending in each province
during this period may have had an impact. In any case, further consideration is needed on more appropriate
variables to measure human capital formation in each province.
5. Conclusion
In order to analyse the determinants of FDI inflows by province in China, this study was created to compare the
development level of the market economy in each province in China from a comprehensive and unified
perspective, as proposed by Fan et al. (2019). In addition to the CMI, we used variables related to each province’s
per capita GDP growth rate, educational level, and industrial structure.
The main results of the analysis are that 1) the progress of the market economy as measured by the CMI has a
positive impact on FDI inflows; 2) the increase in GDP per capita has a positive impact; and 3) looking at the
industrial structure, the increase in the ratio of secondary industries to GDP has had a negative impact but has had
a positive impact on tertiary industries. This result reflects the ongoing shift in FDI to China from vertical FDI, as
seen in export-oriented labour-intensive manufacturing industries, to horizontal FDI, which is oriented toward
sales to local markets.
China intends to advance the sophistication of its own industrial structure through the expansion of FDI into China
by promoting institutional reforms related to the investment environment. In the government activity report of the
14th National People’s Congress held in March 2023, the Chinese government stated that one of the priority
mission tasks to be undertaken in 2023 was “to put even more effort into attracting and utilising foreign capital”
was raised. Specifically, it aims to ease market entry regulations, further open up modern service industries such
Asian Institute of Research Economics and Business Quarterly Reviews Vol.7, No.4, 2024
as ICT-related, finance, real estate, and business services, and to ensure that foreign companies receive national
treatment. This policy orientation was reaffirmed in the Third Plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China in July 2014.
However, the outlook for FDI to China will likely be influenced more strongly by exogenous factors such as
politics and security, as seen in the recent US-China conflict, notably FDI such as those related to high-tech
manufacturing. For example, a survey conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce in China (Shanghai)
among American companies operating in China presented the results as follows (Data taken from the survey
conducted from October to November 2023 (AmCham China, 2024).
・ Nearly half of the respondents said they either plan to decrease investment in China operations, or do not intend
to expand investment in China.
・Rising tensions between the US and China were cited by 61% of respondents as their top concern regarding
their business activity in China.
Regarding FDI to China, which has been one of the driving forces of China’s economic growth as well as industrial
and technological sophistication, it will become more important to analyse it from political and security
perspectives in future international relations.
