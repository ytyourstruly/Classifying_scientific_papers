Abstract
This commentary reviews the recently uploaded manuscript Kempster, G. B., Nagle, K. F., &
Solomon, N. P. (2024, November 12). Development and Rationale for the Consensus
Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice – Revised (CAPE-Vr).
CAPE-V application and co-author of a bilingual adaptation of the original CAPE-V, the
commentary examines key modifications, including the elimination of textual severity markers,
the optimization of vocal tasks, adoption of neutral speech prompts, the transition from visual
analog scales to categorical descriptors for Pitch and Loudness to capture deviation direction,
and the introduction of resonance evaluation separated from nasality. The revised CAPE-Vr
further introduces a dedicated section for inconsistencies, expands options for
instability-related features, and incorporates space for overall impressions, thereby addressing
longstanding challenges and enhancing ease of use. The addition of sections for documenting
recording and playback conditions further enhances replicability and communication among
practitioners. This commentary also identifies potential limitations, such as the exact definition
of the right endpoint on the visual analog scale (VAS), and could benefit from a more
comprehensive definition of resonance. Overall, the CAPE-Vr update represents a significant
advancement in achieving greater usability, consistency, and clarity in perceptual voice
assessment. The revised instrument is poised to improve diagnostic precision, facilitate more
robust research, and support the development of cross-cultural adaptations, ensuring its
continued role as a cornerstone in voice evaluation.
Introduction
I would like to extend my congratulations to the authors for their remarkable work on the
CAPE-Vr. This revision represents a significant advancement in the assessment of voice
disorders, addressing limitations of the original CAPE-V while introducing thoughtful
enhancements to usability and consistency.
In this review, I approach the CAPE-Vr from three distinct perspectives. First, I consider the
challenges of designing robust perceptual assessment tools, with a focus on achieving
conceptual clarity and practical usability. Second, I reflect on the specific demands of adapting
such instruments across languages and cultures, drawing from my experience with the bilingual
Catalan/Spanish adaptation of the CAPE-V (Calaf & Garcia-Quintana, 2024). Finally, I address the
complexities of digitalizing perceptual protocols, informed by my work as the developer of the
All-Voiced app (Calaf, 2024), which integrates the CAPE-V.
I am especially grateful that the authors chose to share this version as a preprint, providing the
scientific community with an invaluable opportunity to engage with their work and contribute
feedback. I hope the following considerations help to further refine this already excellent tool.
Comments on the modifications
Modification 1: Eliminated the textual severity markers below the visual analog scales on the
rating form
The fact that the two existing English versions of the CAPE-V positioned the severity markers for
mild, moderate, and severe (MI, MO, SE) differently contributed to significant heterogeneity in
their placement across various cultural and linguistic adaptations of the instrument. This lack of
consistency underscored the need for greater standardization. Removing the textual severity
markers effectively transforms the scale into a truly unlabeled visual analog scale, which is likely
to reinforce consistency in evaluations and facilitate the comparison of results across studies
and contexts.
In our adaptation, the results of our research led us to eliminate the textual markers entirely and
propose that future versions of the CAPE-V evaluation form omit severity anchors under the VAS
scale altogether (Calaf & Garcia-Quintana, 2024). It is encouraging to see this approach adopted
here, as it aligns with our findings and emphasizes the importance of achieving robust and
comparable data across diverse contexts.
Additionally, this modification greatly facilitates the digitalization of evaluations, an aspect that
has proven particularly beneficial in my experience as developer of the All-Voiced app (Calaf,
2024). By simplifying the structure of the VAS, this change makes the CAPE-Vr more compatible
with digital tools, further maximizing its applicability across diverse clinical and research
contexts.
Modification 2: Modified selected tasks and stimuli
The decision to reduce the number of vowel repetitions to save time during sample collection is
a thoughtful improvement. However, ensuring that a valid and representative sample is obtained
remains a challenge. The proposed strategy—"count to five and hold out the vowel in the word
five as if you were going to continue counting"—is particularly interesting as a means of eliciting
typical productions. Similar strategies are occasionally used in Catalan and Spanish, making this
suggestion reassuring and practical. However, it is worth noting that this strategy is not
explicitly included in the procedural section of the manuscript, and its inclusion might enhance
clarity and consistency.
The change from /a/ in the original CAPE-V to /ɑ/ now may require brief clarification. This is
particularly relevant for the adaptation to other languages where the /ɑ/ vowel phoneme is less
common than in English or even unexisting. That said, a consideration arises as to whether
protocols like this should specify phonemes (/ɑ/) or sounds ([ɑ]). While phonemes are
fundamental for linguistic precision, in practice, voice assessments are based on the actual
sounds produced. Although there may not be a definitive answer, specifying sounds ([ɑ]) might
better reflect the practical reality of what is evaluated and recorded in this type of protocol.
The modification to include “Ed eats eggs every evening” instead of “We eat eggs every Easter” is
highly effective, providing an additional vowel-initial word to assess hard glottal attacks.
Similarly, the replacement of “How hard did he hit him?” with “He helped Hannah hurry home”
is well-considered and aligns with the intended diagnostic purpose. Both changes preserve the
original criteria for the sentences, which ensures that existing adaptations of the CAPE-V in
other languages will not require further revisions here.
With respect to “Patty took a piece of the cake,” replacing “Peter will keep at the peak,” the
rationale for this change is clear and well-justified. Avoiding awkward or unnatural sentences is
an important improvement. The inclusion of considerations for the vowel /i/ and fricatives
demonstrates a thoughtful effort to enhance diagnostic specificity, while the final sentence
remains largely consistent with the original design, maintaining its primary focus on stops. This
careful approach ensures that existing adaptations of the CAPE-V into other languages are
unlikely to require significant revisions also in this case.
With regard to the inclusion of the second sentence of the Rainbow Passage, the rationale for its
addition is clear and well-founded. This sentence offers a long, grammatically typical structure
that is both clinically and acoustically validated, thereby significantly strengthening the CAPE-Vr.
However, this modification will undoubtedly require additional effort for those involved in
adapting the CAPE-V to other languages. Nonetheless, this challenge is an inherent part of the
adaptation process, and suitable solutions will undoubtedly be available.
Modification 3: Changed the spontaneous speech prompt
The change from prompts such as “Tell me about your voice problem” or “Tell me how your
voice is functioning” to “Tell me about a place you have visited or would like to visit” is a
definitely welcome improvement, as it addresses the need for a neutral and inclusive alternative.
The thoughtful considerations underlying the selection of this prompt—such as avoiding
repetitive “sing-song” prosody, ensuring cultural neutrality and inclusivity, and beta testing in a
clinical setting—reinforce the clinical and research robustness of the CAPE-Vr. This choice not
only enhances the usability of the protocol but also supports its broader applicability across
diverse contexts.
Some existing adaptations of the CAPE-V, such as those by Chen et al. (2018), de Almeida et al.
(2019), Mohd Mossadeq et al. (2022), and Venkatraman et al. (2022), have already incorporated
similar neutral prompts, while others continue to use voice-related questions. In our Catalan
and Spanish adaptation (Calaf & Garcia-Quintana, 2024), we opted for a combination of neutral
questions and voice-related prompts. The decision to retain the voice-related prompt was made
to ensure coherence with the original CAPE-V, while also drawing on prior studies, such as
Kondo et al. (2021), to address the need for a neutral alternative.
In this sense, the inclusion of a neutral prompt in the CAPE-Vr sets a clear precedent that will
encourage greater consistency across future adaptations.
Modification 4: Modified pitch and loudness scales to indicate direction but not extent of deviation
from normal
In the original CAPE-V, Pitch and Loudness were rated using visual analog scales (VAS), requiring
raters to specify both the extent and direction of deviation (e.g., whether Pitch was too high or
too low, or Loudness was too soft or too loud). This dual requirement was often overlooked,
leading to incomplete or unreliable data and limiting its validity for clinical and research
purposes. The Perceptual Voice Qualities Database (Walden, 2022), although an invaluable
resource for advancing voice research, exemplifies this limitation in the original CAPE-V, as it
lacks directionality data for Pitch and Loudness. To this respect, I implemented a feature
requiring raters to specify the direction of deviation before providing VAS ratings in the
All-Voiced app (Calaf, 2024), which uses the PVQD dataset. Interestingly, a preliminary analysis
of the data shows a lack of consensus among raters on the direction of the deviation
(unpublished results), confirming that the VAS alone was not sufficient to describe the nature of
the problem.
The CAPE-Vr resolves this issue by replacing VAS ratings for Pitch and Loudness with categorical
descriptors. Raters now classify Pitch as "normal," "low," or "high," and Loudness as "normal,"
"soft," or "loud," ensuring that the direction of deviation is always documented without the need
for numerical scoring. This transition to descriptive categories simplifies the evaluation process
and eliminates a source of variability in the quantification.
Modification 5: Added terms for rating resonance and nasality
The addition of distinct terms for evaluating oral resonance (normal, front, or back) and nasality
(normal, hyponasal, or hypernasal) represents a significant enhancement to the CAPE-Vr. The
separation of oral resonance from nasality addresses a gap in the original CAPE-V, which
previously focused solely on nasality when evaluating resonance. By distinguishing these two
aspects, the CAPE-Vr provides greater clarity in the assessment and treatment of voice
disorders, capturing critical perceptual attributes more comprehensively.
That said, one wonders whether it might be worth considering an additional step: The inclusion
of perceptual attributes related to brilliance or its absence. In clinical practice, voices often
described as flat, dull, unresonant, or muffled—those lacking energy in the frequency range
associated with the speaker’s formant (Bele, 2006)—are commonly encountered. This “mat”
quality is clinically significant, as voices lacking presence are likely to lead speakers to adopt
compensatory strategies that increase the risk of vocal misuse. Including such terms would
enhance the specificity of the evaluation and further differentiate important aspects of
resonance.
I recognize, however, that there is currently limited evidence supporting the perceptual
evaluation of brilliance or its absence. For example, while Irene Bele’s Dimensionality of Voice
Quality (Bele, 2007) explores qualities like Ringing voice or Sonority, there is little research
validating terms like dullness or flatness. Proceeding cautiously in the absence of strong
supporting evidence seems appropriate at this time, particularly given the potential challenges
of implementing such additions in a widely used protocol like the CAPE-V.
Modification 6: Simplified and clarified observations of consistency
The introduction of a dedicated space to report perceived inconsistencies according to task is a
remarkable improvement. It is expectable that this adjustment will reinforce both consistency
and precision in evaluations. The previous Consistent/Intermittent (C/I) approach presented
challenges in terms of usability and interpretation, as it provided insufficient space for detailed
explanations and often resulted in unmarked options. The revised system, “Inconsistencies:
None / Present (describe),” is clearer, more user-friendly, and better supports the precise
documentation of task-specific inconsistencies.
From a technical standpoint, this change also significantly simplifies the digital implementation
of the CAPE-Vr. The previous system’s reliance on a single VAS for multiple ratings posed
significant challenges in accounting for task-specific inconsistencies. The revised system
eliminates these difficulties by streamlining the process, making it both technically feasible and
more practical to integrate into digital tools used in clinical and research contexts.
Overall, this modification is a thoughtful and much-needed improvement that addresses
longstanding limitations of the original CAPE-V while optimizing its usability, reliability, and
adaptability to modern digital environments.
Another significant advancement in the CAPE-Vr is the separation of instabilities, such as tremor
and pitch instability, from the additional features section, along with the inclusion of other
instability sources like aphonic break, pitch break, or spasm. This distinction is crucial, as it
conceptually differentiates stable voice quality features (e.g., aphonia, asthenia, diplophonia,
falsetto, wet/gurgly) from instability-related characteristics (e.g., aphonic break, pitch break,
pitch instability, spasm, or tremor). This clarification addresses a longstanding challenge in
voice evaluations, providing a more structured and precise conceptual framework for
identifying and categorizing the perceptual attributes of the voice. This refinement will
undoubtedly reinforce diagnostic precision and is a highly valuable addition to the revised
protocol.
The addition of “hard glottal attack” is a valuable and much-needed improvement. Including this
parameter addresses a significant gap in the original CAPE-V, where sentences designed to
evaluate hard glottal attacks lacked a corresponding option for documentation. This revision
resolves that issue and strengthens the comprehensiveness of the CAPE-Vr.
That said, the placement of hard glottal attacks under “additional features” may warrant further
consideration. Conceptually, vocal onset (glottal attack) and offset (coda) are distinct
phenomena, separate from stable voice quality features. Creating a dedicated section for vocal
onsets, such as “Glottal attacks: normal / hard / soft,” could provide a more structured
framework for evaluating this feature and align with the broader goal of conceptual clarity in the
CAPE-Vr.
However, separating the evaluation of vocal onsets as a specific parameter would increase the
total number of elements to be assessed, potentially posing challenges for clinical usability.
While balancing the need for comprehensiveness with practical constraints is a complex
decision, the benefits of creating a distinct category for glottal attack seem to outweigh these
drawbacks. This distinction provides clearer conceptual boundaries and enhances the precision
of voice assessments, making it a valuable consideration for the CAPE-Vr.
Modification 7: Added space to write overall impression
The inclusion of space to document the overall impression of the voice is an excellent
advancement. This addition improves the clarity and completeness of the evaluation by allowing
clinicians to record qualitative observations that may not be fully captured through numerical
ratings or predefined categories. By facilitating the expression of nuanced perceptual judgments,
this modification contributes to a more comprehensive and flexible assessment process. This
thoughtful improvement represents a meaningful step forward in the refinement of the CAPE-Vr.
Modification 8: Added sections about recording and analysis conditions
The inclusion of sections to document recording conditions and playback environments
represents a significant advancement. Specifying whether the voice was recorded, the recording
environment (e.g. soundproof booth or clinical room), the equipment used (e.g.
professional-grade microphone or standard device), the playback setup (e.g. headphones or
speakers), the use of auditory anchors (e.g. pre-established voice examples), and the number of
times samples were replayed, helps standardize critical variables. This standardization
strengthens the replicability of voice assessments and facilitates better communication of
findings among clinicians and researchers by ensuring transparency about how the data were
collected and rated.
Modification 9: Updated instructions for administration
The updated instructions represent a significant improvement. They are clear, concise, and
straightforward, offering a user-friendly format that simplifies implementation. Compared to the
original version, the revised instructions are more succinct yet highly informative, providing all
essential details in a streamlined manner.
The Demographics section of the instructions refers to "Name or Patient ID," providing flexibility
in how identifying information is documented. However, the form itself only includes "Name."
For consistency with the instructions and to better support data privacy, it might be preferable
to use "Patient ID" as the default on the form. Prioritizing "Patient ID" would reflect best
practices for safeguarding patient confidentiality while maintaining the necessary linkage to
clinical records.
While recording was already expected in the original CAPE-V, the inclusion of a clearly titled
section, Recording Conditions, is a particularly important addition to the CAPE-Vr. By explicitly
emphasizing the need to document recording conditions, the revised protocol underscores the
value of using recorded samples in voice evaluation. The protocol also permits raters to specify
if assessments were completed in real-time; however, employing recordings is a best practice to
ensure consistency, minimize variability, and enable subsequent reviewing.
The separation between Attributes Rated along Visual Analog Scales and Attributes Rated
Descriptively provides clear guidance for users, ensuring that the different rating modalities are
well-delineated. However, it might be helpful to include explicit instructions on how to select
instabilities and additional features, as these sections are less specified in the current text. For
instance, in the case of inconsistencies, the instructions mention circling the selected options.
Adding similar guidance for selecting instabilities and additional features would reinforce
consistency. While this is demonstrated in the example provided, explicitly stating it in the
instructions would enhance clarity.
A particularly commendable aspect of the updated instructions is the careful refinement of
definitions. For example, the updated definition of Strain represents a significant advancement
in clarity and specificity. Such refinement is particularly relevant to our experience, as we
encountered challenges in adapting the concept of Strain during the cultural and linguistic
adaptation of the CAPE-V for Catalan and Spanish (Calaf & Garcia-Quintana, 2024). While the
original definition “Perception of excessive vocal effort (hyperfunction)” provided a valuable
foundation, the absence of additional detail required us to consult the authors of the instrument
to ensure accurate adaptation decisions. The updated definition “perceived vocal effort, tension,
or press” offers clearer guidance to users and will also undoubtedly assist in future adaptations.
Additionally, the definitions for resonance and nasality are particularly illuminating. These
definitions provide much-needed specificity and clarity, ensuring a shared understanding
among users of the CAPE-Vr. The thoughtful inclusion of the comment that "Loudness variability
may be noted separately under Inconsistencies or Instabilities" is also particularly useful. While
loudness variability is not explicitly listed as an instability in the protocol (unlike pitch), this
guidance ensures that raters are aware of its relevance and understand how to document it
appropriately.
In relation to the VAS, the inclusion of a note to confirm that the lines are 100 mm long is
another practical addition. The suggestion to cross out 100 and insert the actual length,
accompanied by a correction formula, addresses a longstanding challenge with the paper
version. This change is a thoughtful and effective solution that simplifies administration and
ensures greater accuracy in evaluations. The decision to leave the endpoints of the VAS
unlabeled is also commendable. However, while the instructions explicitly state that the left end
of the VAS represents normal (no perceptual deviance), they do not specify what the right end
represents.
Overall, the updated instructions reflect a meticulous and thoughtful approach to refinement.
They strike an effective balance between clarity, precision, and usability, ensuring that the
CAPE-Vr remains a robust tool for both clinical and research applications.
Example of CAPE-Vr Implementation
The inclusion of an example illustrating the administration and scoring of the CAPE-Vr is a
highly valuable addition. Providing a completed form, accompanied by detailed explanations of
the recording and rating processes, offers a clear guidance for professionals.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the CAPE-Vr represents a significant step forward in standardizing the perceptual
evaluation of voice. The thoughtful modifications introduced by the authors enhance the
protocol’s usability, consistency, and conceptual clarity, addressing some key limitations of the
original instrument. These revisions not only maximize its practical implementation but also
open new opportunities for clinical and research applications, strengthening the role of the
CAPE-V as a cornerstone in voice assessment.
In addition, as someone who has worked extensively on adapting the CAPE-V to other languages
and cultures, I find this updated version particularly promising for its potential to guide future
adaptations more effectively. The careful attention to both technical and perceptual challenges
ensures that the CAPE-Vr remains a versatile and reliable tool across diverse linguistic and
cultural settings too.
I am eager to incorporate these improvements into the digital implementation of the CAPE-Vr, as
they provide a robust foundation for advancing our understanding of voice disorders. Thank you
once again for your remarkable contribution to the field—it has been a pleasure to engage with
your work.
