Research Highlights
● We examined longitudinal associations between parents’ reports of infants’ home music
environment at 6-12 months and later vocabulary development at 18 and 24 months.
● Infants exposed to richer home musical environments and more parent singing at 6-12
months tended to have larger expressive vocabularies at 18 and 24 months.
● When accounting for other factors, infants’ general home music environments predicted
24-month vocabulary, while parent singing predicted both 18 and 24-month vocabulary.
● Findings highlight the potential role of music, particularly parent singing, in vocabulary
development and as a potential protective factor for children at-risk of language delay.
Abstract
Informal music experiences and engagement (e.g., parent-child singing activities) are common in
infancy and early childhood. However, the specific role of the early home music environment in
fostering infants’ development is underspecified. Recent theories and empirical evidence
demonstrate shared biology between music and language processing, as well as overlapping
acoustic characteristics of speech and song. Emerging yet limited work has established positive
links between infants’ early home music environments and their later receptive vocabulary
development. Here, we assessed whether infants’ home music environment is a significant
unique predictor of infants’ expressive vocabulary development, an established early marker of
children’s language outcomes. In this longitudinal study, 42 parents completed the
Music@Home questionnaire to capture their 6-12 month old infants’ home music environments.
Parents subsequently completed the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory
when their infants were 18- and 24-months of age as a measure of their infants’ expressive
vocabulary development. Results demonstrated that the amount parents sing to their infants at 6-
12 months significantly predicted their infants’ vocabulary at both 18 months and 24 months,
even when accounting for other parental factors (parents’ musicality, education levels, parental
verbal responsivity, and parent-child affective attachment). Infants’ general home music
environments predicted infants’ vocabulary at 24 months. These findings highlight the
importance of rich home musical activities, especially parent singing, as a potential facilitator of
early vocabulary development. Findings also motivate further research on how enriched home
musical environments may serve as a potential protective factor for children at risk for
developmental speech/language disorders.
Individual differences in infants’ early home music environment are associated with later
expressive vocabulary development outcomes
Informal music activities and experiences, such as parent singing and listening to
recorded music, are common in infancy (Mendoza & Fausey, 2021; Yan et al., 2021). As a
highly social and linguistically rich form of communication, home musical experiences may
contribute to shaping children’s communication and language development. Furthermore,
evidence suggests that early music and language development not only parallel each other but are
intricately linked, as the language infants are exposed to and process is, arguably, musical
(Brandt et al., 2012). Considering features of infant-directed speech and song may help explain
associations between the quantity and quality of infant-directed communication and children’s
language development trajectories (Rowe, 2012; Weisleder & Fernald, 2013).
Infant-directed speech is characterized by its increased repetitiveness and rhythmicity,
slower tempo, and higher pitch and more exaggerated pitch contours compared to adult-directed
speech(Alviar et al., 2022; Fernald et al., 1989; Grieser & Kuhl, 1988; Hilton et al., 2022). These
features are important for capturing infants’ attention and supporting their engagement (Nakata
& Trehub, 2004; Trainor, 1996; Trehub et al., 2016). Infant-directed singing expands on many
features of infant-directed speech. Compared to infant-directed speech, infant-directed singing is
even slower and more rhythmic as it is organized around a regular beat, making it more
predictable and highly effective at both capturing and maintaining infants’ attention and
engagement (Alviar et al., 2022; Cirelli et al., 2020; Trehub et al., 2016). Infants also tend to
sustain greater attention to infant-directed singing over speech, particularly for audiovisual
(versus audio only) renditions (Nakata & Trehub, 2004; Trehub et al., 2016; Tsang et al., 2017).
When engaged by audiovisual renditions, infants in the second half of the first year of life, a
sensitive period for language development, direct their visual attention toward adults’ mouths
more during infant-directed song than infant-directed speech (Alviar et al., 2022). Visual
attention toward an adult’s mouth, which provides redundant and synchronized auditory and
visual cues about the speech signal, predicts later expressive language (Elsabbagh et al., 2014;
Santapuram et al., 2022; Tenenbaum et al., 2015; Young et al., 2009).
Neural evidence in infancy also supports the notion of associations between music and
language development. Electrophysiological cortical findings reveal that infant brain responses
to sung speech (but not speech with a “flat contour”) (François et al., 2017) and to maternal
singing of playsongs (Nguyen et al., 2023) predict children’s later expressive vocabulary. Taken
together, neuroimaging findings, in conjunction with emerging behavioral evidence, suggest a
potential role of parent singing in facilitating language learning.
Emerging evidence from cross-sectional studies also suggests positive associations
between young children’s informal home music environment and language development. In 2-3
year olds, increased engagement in informal music activities was concurrently linked with better
auditory discrimination and attention (Putiken & Huotilainen). In 3-4 year olds, children’s
parent-reported informal music experiences are associated with their grammar development
(Politimou et al., 2019). Relationships between the informal home music environment and
language development have also been demonstrated in infancy. In a cross-sectional study of 8-18
month old infants, infants’ general home music environment (but not the home reading
environment) was associated with infants’ concurrent gestural communication (above and
beyond the effects of age) (Papadimitriou et al., 2021). Both the general home music
environment and parent singing (but not the home reading environment) were related to
receptive vocabulary skills in infants younger than 12 months old (Papadimitriou et al., 2021).
While these cross-sectional studies provide a foundation for studying the potential role of the
informal home music environment in later language development, more research with
longitudinal study designs in infancy is needed.
A few studies have examined informal music experiences and vocabulary development
longitudinally. Two studies examined these longitudinal associations in infancy. In the first
study, parent singing with 6-month-old infants was positively linked to the infants’ later
receptive vocabulary at 14 months (Franco et al., 2022). In the other study, which focused on
more general musical experiences, more passive music exposure in the home environment for
children 12-30 months of age predicted the children’s subsequent expressive vocabulary about
one year later (Ko & McDonald, 2023). These two existing studies have limited sample sizes
(range n = 18-26 infants per study) and do not account for other parental factors. In a large study
with preschool-aged children, findings have suggested associations between informal home
music activities at 2-3 years old and receptive vocabulary skills two years later, though this
relationship was not significant once controlling for the home reading environment (a known
important factor during this later developmental stage) (Williams et al., 2015). Since many
environmental, neural, and genetic factors may influence relationships between musicality and
language across the lifespan, including the extent to which parents create certain music and
language environments for their children (Nayak et al., 2022), more rigorous longitudinal
investigation of associations between infants’ home music environment and later vocabulary
development is needed.
Given the limited existing literature on how infants’ home music environment may be
associated with and potentially facilitate language development, the primary aim of the present
study is to determine whether and to what extent infants’ home music environment at 6-12
months is associated with their expressive vocabulary development outcomes at 18 and 24
months old. The present study focuses on expressive vocabulary as it is an established predictor
of later language outcomes (Fenson et al., 2007; Lee, 2011). We hypothesize that infants’ overall
home music environment and parent singing in particular (a subset of the overall home music
environment of particular relevance as described above) will predict infants’ later expressive
vocabulary development outcomes. To capture the unique contributions of the musical
environment/singing, we also consider contributions of other factors with potential relevance to
child language development and musical engagement such as parent education (a proxy for
socioeconomic status), parent musicality (including achievement, abilities, and engagement
levels), parent-child attachment, and parental responsivity in predictive models of infants’
expressive vocabulary development. Building a better understanding of potential unique links
between early musical experiences, including parent singing, and expressive vocabulary
development in the context of other family factors can inform implications for informal music
experiences to facilitate language both in general and especially for children at risk of or with
language delays.
Method
Participants
Forty-two infants and their parents were included in analyses for the present study. All
infants passed their newborn hearing screening, all were born at least 36 weeks gestation, and
none were diagnosed with any neurologic or genetic disorders. Forty-five infant-parent dyads
were initially enrolled as part of a larger longitudinal study, but three were excluded due to
premature birth (born at 32 weeks gestation) (n = 1) or not completing vocabulary development
questionnaires at any follow-up time points (n = 2). At enrollment, infants (26 female, 16 male)
were 6-12 months old (M = 9.38, SD = 2.02). Parents who completed the study questionnaires
included 38 mothers and 4 fathers of the infants; all were biological parents. The primary
Education level was rated on an ordinal scale from 0 (0 years of school) to 8 (3 to 4+ years of
graduate or professional school). Parent age and education reflect the parent who completed the
study questionnaires. Families were recruited from the greater Nashville area through mailing
lists, flyers and community events.

Procedure
Longitudinal questionnaire data were collected at the following three time points: at study
enrollment when infants were aged 6-12 months old, when infants were 18 months old, and
when infants were 24 months old. In addition, parents completed one more supplementary
follow-up at a later time point (when infants were 36 months) documenting additional parental
factors known to impact children’s home environments. All study questionnaires were collected
via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a secure online survey and database web
application (Harris et al., 2009). At enrollment, during an in-person visit in the lab, parents
completed a demographics questionnaire, the Music@Home–Infant questionnaire (henceforth,
Music@Home (Politimou et al., 2018), and the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold-
MSI) (Müllensiefen et al., 2014). At the 18-month and 24-month timepoints, parents completed
the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (Fenson et al., 2007) Words and
Sentences (CDI-WS) form remotely from home. When children were 36 months old, parents
completed the Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale (MPAS; Condon & Corkindale, 1998) and
subscales of the StimQ -Toddler (StimQ -T; Cates et al., 2023) questionnaires remotely from
2 2
home. Participation was compensated with a gift card at the first visit and with a gift card and
small gift after filling out the questionnaires when the infant turned 36 months old. All study
measures were approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review
Board and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All parents provided
written informed consent.
Measures
Infant Home Music Environment
To capture infants’ home music environment, parents completed the Music@Home
(Politimou et al., 2018) at the time of study enrollment when their infant was 6-12 months old.
The Music@Home is a validated and reliable parent-report measure for infants up to 2 years old
that captures infants’ home music environment, including infants’ active engagement with music
and parents’ initiation of musical activities with their infant. The questionnaire consists of 18
items that result in a Music@Home total score, in addition to scores for the following subscales:
Parental Beliefs (parents’ beliefs regarding the benefits of music to their child’s development),
Child Active Engagement (children’s active participation in and initiation of musical
activities/behaviors), Parent Initiation of Singing (parents’ engagement in singing activities with
the child), and Parent Initiation of Music-Making (parent-child music-making activities). Due to
the focus on the overall home music environment and parent singing in the present study, only
the Music@Home total score and Music@Home Parent Initiation of Singing subscale score are
reported and included in analyses. Music@Home items are rated on a 7-point Likert scale. The
total scores range from 18 to 126, while the Parent Initiation of Singing subscale score ranges
from 5 to 35.
Infant Vocabulary
At the 18- and 24-month time points, parents completed the CDI-WS form, which
captures expressive vocabulary for children aged 16-30 months based on a 680-item vocabulary
checklist (Fenson et al., 2007). From the vocabulary checklist, the total number of words
produced was used for analyses. CDI-WS data from one 18-month old and three 24-month olds
were missing.
Parent Musicality
At the time of enrollment, parents completed the Gold-MSI (Müllensiefen et al., 2014)
questionnaire, which is a validated, 38-item self-report measure that captures several aspects of
individuals’ musical experiences, including musical skills, expertise, achievements, and
behaviors. The Gold-MSI questionnaire provides a general musical sophistication factor score, as
well as subscale scores for Active Engagement, Perceptual Abilities, Musical Training, Singing
Ability, and Emotions. For the current study, parents’ general musical sophistication scores were
included in analyses as an overall measure of parental musicality. The general musical
sophistication score is calculated from 18 items rated on a 7-point Likert scale, resulting in a
score ranging from 18 to 126.
Parent-Child Attachment
To assess parent-child attachment, characterized here as a measure of the emotional bond
or the affection a parent experiences toward their child, parents completed the MPAS (Condon,
2015; Condon & Corkindale, 1998) at the 36-month time point. This self-report questionnaire
consists of 19 items that are rated on 2-5-point Likert scales and results in a total score ranging
from 19 to 95. Although the MPAS was originally designed for use with mothers of infants from
birth to 12 months, the word “baby” was replaced by “child” within questions to adapt the
measure for use with parents of older children. The MPAS was completed by 35 parents (7
missing).
Parental Responsivity
The StimQ -T questionnaire was designed to capture the cognitive home learning
environment of children aged 12-36 months old (Cates et al., 2023). Parents completed two of
the four StimQ -T subscales: Parental Involvement in Developmental Advance (Teaching)
(PIDA) scale and Parental Verbal Responsivity (PVR) scale at the 36-month time point. These
two subscales were chosen to obtain a quick measure of parents’ general responsivity with their
child. Scores range from 0 to 5 for the PIDA scale and 0 to 15 for the PVR scale. Due to low
variation in PIDA scores (majority of parents [30 of 35] scoring at ceiling [5/5] and the
remainder scoring a 4/5), PIDA scores were not included in analyses. Although designed for
administration via structured interview, StimQ -T subscales were administered as self-report
questionnaires in accordance with Politimou et al (2018). The StimQ -T was completed by 35
parents (7 missing).
Statistical Analyses
The objective of our investigation was to determine if infants’ general home music
environment (Music@Home total score) and parental singing to infants (Music@Home Parent
Initiation of Singing subscale score) could predict infants’ later expressive vocabulary (CDI-WS
total number of words) at 18- and 24- month follow-up time points. First, bivariate correlation
analyses were conducted between the music and vocabulary scores. Then, multiple linear
regression analyses were employed to assess whether the general home music environment and
parent singing predicted infant vocabulary, when accounting for individual differences in various
demographic and environmental factors. Four linear regression models were run in total. Models
1 and 2 included the general home music environment as a predictor, while Models 3 and 4
included parent singing as a predictor. In Models 1 and 3, the outcome variable was 18-month
vocabulary, while in Models 2 and 4, the outcome variable was 24-month vocabulary. For all
models, infants’ age at enrollment (due to the 6-12 month old enrollment range), parent
education, parent-child attachment, parental responsivity, and parent musicality were included as
covariates. All statistical analyses were conducted in R. Model diagnostics, including reviewing
residual plots and comparing normal QQ-plots of the models including the vocabulary variables
with and without log transformation, confirmed non-transformed models provided a better fit to
the data. Therefore, the vocabulary variables were not transformed and a linear regression
approach was deemed appropriate. Cases with missing parent-child attachment and parental
responsivity scores were excluded from regression analyses.
Results
Correlations Between Music and Vocabulary Variables
music variables were associated with each other, and vocabulary scores at the two time points
were associated with each other. Parent musicality was also significantly correlated with both
infants’ general home music environment (r = .51, p < .001) and parent singing (r = .48, p
= .001). From the CDI-WS measure, infants’ vocabularies at 18-months and 24-months were
correlated, r = .72, p < .001.
Infants’ general home music environment was positively correlated with both 18-month
vocabulary (r = .36, p = .02) and 24-month vocabulary (r = .43, p = .006). Similarly, parent
singing was positively correlated with both 18-month vocabulary (r = .45, p = .003) and 24-
month vocabulary (r = .62, p < .001). None of the other covariates included in the linear
regressions showed significant correlations with the music and vocabulary variables.

2). Infants’ general home music environment predicted infants’ 24-month vocabulary but not
their 18-month vocabulary, after controlling for infants’ age when the Music@Home was
completed, parent education, parent-child attachment, parental responsivity, and parent
musicality. Model 1 explained 22.7% of the variance in infants’ 18-month vocabulary, while
Model 2 explained 21.9% of the variance in infants’ 24-month vocabulary. In the second set of

Model 4 explained 38.1% of the variance in infants’ 24-month vocabulary. Models 1 and 3
additionally revealed that a younger infant age (between 6 and 12 months) at the time when their

Discussion
The present study aimed to address how individual differences in infants’ home music
environment are associated with vocabulary development during infancy, while controlling for
the contributions of various potential confounding factors. To do this, we investigated how
infants’ early home music environment, and parent singing in particular, relates to their later
expressive vocabulary development. Findings revealed that infants exposed to richer general
home music environments and specifically, more parent singing, tended to have larger expressive
vocabularies at 18 and 24 months old. These results held for parent singing after controlling for
the effects of infants’ age, parent education, parent musicality, parent-child attachment, and
parental responsivity. This positive relationship between infants’ general home music
environment and later expressive vocabulary at 24 months held after controlling for the same
variables, but not at 18 months.
The positive associations observed between the general home music environment and
expressive vocabulary development, as well as parent singing and expressive vocabulary
development, aligns with and expands on the limited previous literature (Franco et al., 2022; Ko
& McDonald, 2023; Papadimitriou et al., 2021) by examining these associations longitudinally
and accounting for key covariates: parent education, parent musicality, parent-child attachment,
and parental responsivity. While associations with expressive language development in the
current study were observed for the general home music environment, findings were stronger and
more consistent across analyses for the more focused parent singing construct. This may be
because the general home music environment encompasses a range of constructs including
children’s music engagement, parents’ initiation of singing and music-making with their child,
and parents’ beliefs about music for their child’s development. When considered alongside the
stronger and more consistent results for parent singing on child expressive vocabulary, it appears
that musical aspects of the home environment that are more infant-directed, more socially
engaged, verbal, and linguistically rich (i.e., as opposed to background or instrumental music
exposure) may be the most supportive of language development. This interpretation is consistent
with developmental literature pointing to the broader role of parent engagement in socially
meaningful activities in facilitating language development (Ramírez-Esparza et al., 2014; Rowe,
2012). It is also possible that because parental infant-directed singing has a more substantial
linguistic component, it has greater bootstrapping effects for word learning by increasing
exposure to novel words in a musically-enriched context.
Multiple potential mechanisms may play a role in the relationship between parent singing
and expressive vocabulary development. Though the nature of the present analyses limits causal
inferences, parent singing may directly facilitate word learning due to specific properties of
infant-directed singing (Alviar et al., 2022). Previous findings suggest a facilitative effect of
infant-directed speech (versus adult-directed speech) on word learning and word segmentation in
infants and young children (Ma et al., 2011; Thiessen et al., 2005), in part due to the prosodic
characteristics of infant-directed speech that support infants’ attention and processing. Infant-
directed singing enhances many of these properties of infant-directed speech, exhibiting
increased musical structure and predictability, as well as reduced tempo and rhythmic variability,
thus also providing a context facilitative of, and perhaps even heightened for, word learning
(Alviar et al., 2022; Franco et al., 2022). Indeed, experimental studies reveal increased
processing and learning of verbal information presented via (adult-directed) song versus speech
in infants and toddlers (Ma et al., 2024; Thiessen & Saffran, 2009). In addition to properties of
infant-directed singing that may explain a facilitative effect of singing on vocabulary
development, another possible explanatory mechanism may be that infant-directed singing is a
highly social context that coordinates parent-infant interactions (Lense et al., 2022; Markova et
al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2023). These coordinated social interactions may in turn support and
facilitate children’s language development. Notably, the current associations between the home
music environment/singing and infant language development were maintained even when
controlling for other aspects of parent-child social engagement.
Recent literature has also emphasized the role of the interplay between genetic,
environmental, and neural factors in explaining relationships between music and language traits
(Nayak et al., 2022; Wesseldijk et al., 2023). For example, the ability to synchronize with a
musical beat shares some genetic factors with developmental language traits (Alagöz et al.,
2024). More broadly, the Musical Abilities, Pleiotropy, Language, and Environment (MAPLE)
framework (Nayak et al., 2022) posits shared genetic influences between musicality factors and
language traits. Within this framework, the positive association between parent singing and
vocabulary development may be partially driven by shared genetic factors and gene-environment
interactions. For example, the environmental factor of the amount of parent singing may in turn
be influenced by genetic predispositions for parent musicality, as informal and formal music
experience, general music engagement levels, and musical abilities are all known to be
moderately heritable (Gustavson et al., 2021; Ullén et al., 2014; Vinkhuyzen et al., 2009).
Therefore, parents who are on the higher end of these traits may be more likely to expose their
children to music and singing. In the present study sample, the positive associations between
parent musicality and infants’ home music environment variables align with this view, such that
parents with greater musical sophistication scores tend to provide their infants richer home music
environments. In sum, “more musical” home environments may partly reflect genetic
predispositions for musicality in parents and families, which may also influence vocabulary
growth trajectories and other language skills in early development. Genetic factors such as these
complement the neural processing mechanisms that are well-established to be overlapping
between musical and language abilities (Patel, 2003, 2011).
While the longitudinal design, consideration of relevant covariates, and inclusion of
expressive vocabulary as a novel outcome measure are strengths of the present study, some
limitations and future directions should be considered. Controlling for important environmental
factors regarding parent-child engagement (parental responsivity and parent-child attachment)
demonstrates that infants’ home music environment is not necessarily only a reflection of
broader positive parenting approaches; however, future work should measure these factors
concurrently at earlier time points. Notably, these putative covariates did not have significant
relationships with expressive vocabulary development. It is possible that parents who spend
more time with their infants and provide more linguistic input also sing more to their infants.
Yet, recent evidence demonstrated a lack of association between speech and music input (using
daylong audio recordings), or music and reading input (based on parent report), suggesting music
may independently contribute to infants’ development during this developmental period (Hippe
et al., 2024; Politimou et al., 2018). As well, measures from the current study are entirely
obtained via parent report, which may result in response bias. Future studies could directly
quantify the home music environment and home language environment, such as through daylong
recordings using the digital language processor from the Language ENvironment Analysis
(LENA) system (Hippe et al., 2024; Mendoza & Fausey, 2021). Additionally, though recruitment
efforts were broad, families who are interested and invested in children’s early development may
have self-selected to enroll in this study. The homogenous sample with regard to race and
socioeconomic factors (i.e., highly educated) overall limits the generalizability of findings.
Integrating families with more diverse music, language, and cultural experiences in future
research is crucial to understanding relationships between infants’ language development, music
environments, and other environmental factors.
Importantly, these findings motivate future clinical research on the utility of early
musical experiences during infancy as a potential protective factor for infants who are at risk of
language delay or disorder. Building on growing evidence that individual differences in musical
processing and abilities are associated with speech and language skills (reviewed in Nayak et al.,
2022), our findings support recent work showing the role of early musical rhythm skills in
predicting later speech and language disorders (Ladányi et al., 2020; Nayak et al., 2024). While a
wide range of expressive vocabulary scores are represented in the present sample, future work
should prospectively investigate these associations in samples that include infants at elevated
likelihood for language disorders and test whether the home music environment is associated
with later language delays or disorders. Future work to clarify these effects could potentially
inform music-based interventions to support at-risk infants’ development (Virtala & Partanen,
2018). Regardless of risk of speech and language delays, shared musical activities, including
parent singing, are accessible activities (including to “non-musical” parents) and may be optimal
contexts within which to target language development goals (Lense & Camarata, 2020). Overall,
findings from this study highlight the important role of rich home musical activities, especially
parent singing, in vocabulary development and can inform recommendations to families on how
to promote young children’s rich auditory-linguistic home environments.
