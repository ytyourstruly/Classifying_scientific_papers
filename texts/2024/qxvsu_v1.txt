Is Laziness Contagious? How the Behaviour of Those Around You Impacts Your
Effort
People are lazy. Although there are important exceptions, we prefer to exert less rather than more effort to gain
the same reward. People are also social, and we often exert effort with others around, for example at the office,
library, or cafe. Here, we ask if human laziness is shaped by those around us. Are we less lazy when we’re
around hard-workers? Are we more lazy when we’re around slackers? Across eight studies (N = 1473), we
gave people a demand-selection task where they repeatedly chose between a hard or easy task. Our results
revealed that participants exerted significantly more effort after learning that previous participants consistently
chose the harder task, compared to a control group who received no information about others' choices.
Interestingly, participants who were told that others typically opted for the easier task, did not exert less effort
than the control group. These results indicate that while others can help us resist laziness and inspire us to
work harder, there appears to be a limit to our laziness. We might be effort misers, but this miserliness has a
ceiling.
In modern work environments, individuals are frequently surrounded by others while they
complete tasks. Whether in an office, classroom, or shared workspace, the behaviour of those
around us may subtly influence our willingness to engage in effortful tasks. Research shows that
people act as 'effort misers,' generally seeking to minimise effort, but this work focuses mainly
on individual settings, overlooking social influence. Although some research has evaluated how
social influence impacts effort choices, it has predominantly shown evidence for the contagion of
effortful behaviour, with little focus on whether laziness, i.e., effort avoidance, itself can be
similarly contagious. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating how both effort and effort
avoidance preferences are shaped within social contexts—where individuals are exposed to the
behaviour of others—compared to isolated contexts.
Cognitive Effort Avoidance
Effort is typically aversive, prompting individuals to minimise it whenever possible, a preference
aligned with the 'law of least effort' (Hull, 1943), which suggests a natural tendency to conserve
energy. Support for this principle can be observed across evolutionary, phenomenological, and
behavioural perspectives (Job et al., 2024).
First, the evolutionary perspective suggests that effort is weighed against benefits to conserve
energy for survival (Liberman, 2015). Along similar lines, Expectancy-Value Theory proposes
that individuals engage in effort allocation based on a cost-benefit calculation (Eccles et al.,
1983). The phenomenological perspective complements this by suggesting that effort feels
intrinsically aversive, evidenced by strong associations between mental effort and negative affect
(David et al., 2024). This alignment between subjective experience and the law of least effort
provides experimental support for the theory (David et al., 2022).
In terms of behavioural evidence, studies consistently show that people favour the least effortful
choice when given the option (Kool et al., 2010; Westbrook et al., 2013). Across various
contexts, individuals reduce cognitive effort when they have the flexibility to do so (Cameron et
al., 2019; Kool et al., 2010; Vogel et al., 2020; Westbrook et al., 2013; Zipf, 1949). Notably, this
tendency extends beyond error minimization, demand characteristics, or specific task stimuli
(Kool et al., 2010; cf. Dunn et al., 2019). In fact, individuals are even willing to forgo monetary
rewards (Embrey et al., 2022) or endure physical discomfort to avoid effort (Vogel et al., 2020).
However, research also highlights boundaries to effort aversion. When adequately incentivized,
individuals are willing to increase their effort (Clay et al., 2022; Devine & Otto, 2021; Kool &
Botvinick, 2014). While studies have examined ways to reduce effort aversion, few have
investigated its true extent. With sufficient incentive or a plausible justification to exert less
effort than they might otherwise, it remains uncertain whether individuals would indeed choose
to do so. Here, we ask if the social context in which one works (i.e., hearing that past individuals
avoid or prefer effort) impacts one’s willingness to exert effort. The law of least effort would
suggest that individuals would prefer the least effortful task regardless of what others have done
previously. However, as we are inherently social creatures, there is reason to believe that social
influence may play a role in our effort choices.
Social Norms Influence Behaviour
Effort choices are often studied in isolated settings, yet in real life, people’s behaviour is
frequently shaped by social influence. In real-world settings, our choices are rarely made in
solitude; instead, we are frequently surrounded by others whose behaviour can subtly or overtly
affect our own. Therefore, our effort choices are likely to be affected by the behaviour of others
and norms that they represent. In uncertain or ambiguous situations where it is unclear what the
social norms are, individuals look to the behaviour of others to determine what behaviour should
be enacted (dos Santos Pereira, 2024). Descriptive norms, what people do in a similar situation
(Cialdini, 2021), are more prevalent in ambiguous situations where individuals have no strong
preferences and provide evidence about the real world that individuals use to guide their
behaviours (Legroes & Cislaghi, 2020). Cognitive tasks measuring effort are purposefully
ambiguous allowing individuals to act in a way that represents their true preferences. Thus, when
a descriptive norm is introduced it is likely to guide individuals behaviour as they have a desire
to conform (Aarts & Dijksterhuis, 2003; Jacobson et al., 2011) and be accurate in their
judgments and actions (Cialdini & Trost, 1998).
Descender et al. (2016) was similarly interested in the effect of social norms on effort choices
and investigated the effect of working alongside an effortful or effort averse other. They found
that people working near others performing a high-effort task also tended to exert more effort
themselves, even when their tasks were unrelated. Similarly, Gilman et al. (2015) demonstrated
that social influence plays a big role in how much effort people are willing to put in, especially
when rewards are uncertain. They found that seeing others work harder made participants work
harder too, while seeing others put in less effort led participants to reduce their own effort. Our
study builds on this by isolating the effect of social influence from reward uncertainty, clarifying
how both effort and laziness norms can spread in social contexts.
The Current Investigation
In the current research, we explore how social context influences effort preferences. Specifically,
we investigate whether information about the effort choices of others can alter individuals’ own
willingness to exert effort. Across eight studies, participants chose between a high effort task and
a low effort task. We additionally examined phenomenological ratings of effort of the tasks along
with individual differences in effort preferences and social desirability. If people truly avoid
cognitive effort, they should prefer the low effort task no matter the behaviour of others.
However, we believe this to be unlikely because the behaviour of others provides important
information on what is socially acceptable, especially in ambiguous tasks such as this one. Thus,
we suspected that people who are informed that others pick an easier task will exert less effort,
whereas those informed that others pick a harder task will exert more effort compared to
individuals who receive no information of the behaviour of others.
Method
Participants
Across 8 studies, 1913 participants were recruited from the University of Toronto Scarborough
undergraduate student pool and Prolific Academic, an online participant pool. Following a
sensitivity analysis, we aimed to include 200 participants in each study, allowing us to detect a
medium effect (d = .4) given our between-person design at an alpha of .05 and 80% power (Faul
et al., 2007). After excluding individuals, with criteria that were pre-registered in most of our
analysis included 1473 participants (M = 26.36, SD = 11.89, female = 62.73%).
age age
We implemented exclusion criteria to ensure that we only included participants that followed
instructions and were engaged in our studies in our analysis. First, to ensure participants were
paying attention, they were excluded if they failed any attention checks (N = 178) or answered a
question about the manipulation incorrectly (N = 69). Second, to ensure that participants did not
randomly make choices while doing something else, they were excluded if they failed more than
20% of their high-effort trials (N = 89) or 70% of their low-effort trials (N = 86).
Procedure
In all studies individuals were shown a graphic that illustrated the choices of past participants.
This graphic was preceded with a statement summarising past participant’s preferences and was
followed by testimonials from past participants and a scientific explanation for past participant’s
completed demographic and personality measures.
Manipulation
Note. In Study 2, individuals saw a video instead of the bar graph. In Study 3, the manipulation
was framed such that individuals avoided the non-chosen task instead of choosing the particular
task. In Studies 4-8, the manipulation was strengthened by changing the graph to depict an 84-16
split.
Material
Effort Tasks
In each trial of the effort task, individuals chose between an easy and hard cognitive task in the
form of different coloured decks presented to the left and right of the middle of the screen.
Participants were instructed to try both decks but if one felt preferable then they could choose
that one more often. We emphasised the point by mentioning that “while we hope that you
answer some questions correctly, accuracy is not our focus” and that they should “not let
accuracy influence [their] deck selection.” In all studies except Study 7 high effort was
operationalized as the Add-3 task and low effort as the Add-0 task. In Study 7, high effort was
operationalized as pressing a button on screen 70 times and low effort as pressing a button 20
times.
In each trial of the Add-N task, individuals were to choose between two Add-N tasks, in the form
of different coloured decks. One deck corresponded with an Add-3 task, while the other was the
Add-0 task. During each trial, participants were shown a sequence of four digits, one at a time,
for one second each. After the sequence, they had to add the specified number (either 0 or 3) to
each digit and type the final four-digit sequence into a text box (e.g., the correct answer for “2 8
3 0” in the Add-3 is 5163). Correct responses required the entire sequence to be accurate.
In each trial of the button task, the two colour decks correspond to the 70 click and the 20 click
condition. Individuals were to press the button until it disappeared, which indicated that they
pressed it 70 times or 20 times, depending on the condition. The button was present for 10
seconds. The trial was deemed correct if they pressed it the appropriate amount of times.
Phenomenological Ratings and Individual Differences
Participants rated the degree of effort they believed past participants experienced during the task
on NASA Task Load Index. This was important to gauge whether the manipulation was
successful. In Studies 1, 2, 6, and 7 participants in the high effort condition believed past
participants found the task easier than individuals in the low effort. We assessed participants'
reasoning behind their deck choices, asking whether their decisions were influenced by factors
such as (a) interest in the deck, (b) expected performance outcomes, (c) social influence, (d)
social desirability, (e) enjoyment, (f) stress reduction, (g) seeking a challenge, (h) spontaneous
preference, or (i) perceived experimenter demand. Across several studies, participants generally
reported consistent motivations for their deck selections, with some notable differences across
conditions. In high-effort conditions, participants were less likely to attribute their choices to
social norms, competition, or performance compared to low-effort and control conditions.
Conversely, high-effort participants were more likely to cite intrinsic motivations, such as
interest or acting spontaneously (“felt like it”), as reasons for their choices. These findings
suggest that individuals in high-effort conditions may downplay external influences, highlighting
a preference for more self-determined reasoning.
We also assessed two individual difference variables. The Need for Cognition Scale (Cacioppo &
Petty, 1982) measured participants' enjoyment of cognitive effort, while the Conscientiousness
subscale of the Big Five Inventory (Soto & John, 2017) assessed thoughtfulness, goal
orientation, and self-control. Need for cognition consistently emerged as a significant predictor
of effort preferences, although it did not account for the observed differences between
conditions. In contrast, conscientiousness was a less reliable predictor of effort preferences,
showing positive associations in some studies, negative associations in others, and no significant
relationship in several cases.
Results
Study 1: Hearing about the Effort Choices of Others
We first sought to demonstrate that effort choices are affected by the behaviour of past
participants. Participants were shown a graph which indicated that past participants chose the
Add 0/Add 3 task 72% of the time and the Add 3/Add 0 task 28% of the time, for the low effort
and high effort condition respectively. Participants then chose between the Add-3 and Add-0
task. Participants then selected between the Add-3 and Add-0 tasks.
Participants across all conditions demonstrated effort avoidance, selecting the Add-3 task
significantly less than chance (M = 39.68%, SD = 0.31), t(221) = -4.91, p < .001, d = -0.33.
Additionally, individuals in the high effort (M = .48, SD = .32) condition exerted more effort as
shown by their greater tendency to pick the harder Add 3 task compared to the control condition
(M = .31, SD = .27), t(142.54) = 3.396, p = .0009, d = .56. Interestingly, participants in the
low-effort condition (M = 0.40, SD = 0.33) also selected the Add-3 task more often than the
control group, but this result was not significant. Since individuals do not typically encounter
proportions in this format, we next examined whether observing others' effort choices might
produce similar effects.
Study 2: Seeing the Effort Choices of Others
To determine if watching others' effort choices influences behavior, participants observed a video
of a participant completing 20 trials. A running total of which deck was chosen was visible at the
bottom of the screen to ensure individuals knew that the Add 0/Add 3 deck was chosen the
majority of the time for the low effort and high effort condition, respectively.
As in Study 1, participants showed significant effort avoidance, selecting the Add-3 task less
than chance (M = 40.83%, SD = 0.31), t(210) = -4.27, p < 001, d = -0.29. Participants in the
high-effort condition (M = 0.49, SD = 0.33) chose the Add-3 task more often than those in the
control condition (M = 0.37, SD = 0.29), t(133.25) = 2.27, p = .02, d = 0.38, and the low-effort
condition (M = 0.36, SD = 0.30), t(132.79) = 2.39, p = .02, d = 0.41. There was no significant
difference between the low-effort and control conditions. Individuals may have not been putting
in less effort than typical as the persuasiveness to follow an undesirable norm wasn’t strong
enough.
Study 3: Hearing which Effort Tasks Individuals Avoided
To enhance the manipulation's persuasive impact, we framed past participants' behaviour in
terms of what they avoided or chose not to do, rather than which task they preferred, following
the approach used by Bergquist and Nilsson (2019). Individuals were shown the same graphic as
in Study 1 but instead of being told that people chose the easier Add 0 or harder Add 3 deck,
they were told that past participants avoided the harder Add 3/easier Add 0 deck, for the low
effort and high effort condition respectively. Once again, we found that individuals were effort
averse, picking the Add-3 task significantly less than chance (M = .31, SD = .33), t(210) = -8.39,
p < 0.001, d = -.58. However, individuals preferred the effortful task significantly more in the
high effort condition (M = .39, SD = .37) compared to the control (M = .26, SD = .29), t(127.48)
= 2.3, p = 0.02, d = .39 and there was no significant difference between the low effort (M = .29,
SD = .31) and the other conditions. We worried that this manipulation may not have been
persuasive and instead confusing to participants so we once again aimed to strengthen the
persuasiveness of the message.
Study 4: Student Sample/Stronger Manipulation
We realised that the behaviour of individuals in the low effort conditions was similar to the norm
we provided, picking the high effort task around 28% of the time. Thus, we examined whether
strengthening the norm would result in participants' in the low effort condition picking the easier
task significantly more than the control condition. Participants, recruited from the university
student sample, were shown a graph which indicated that past participants chose the Add 0/Add
3 task 84% of the time and the Add 3/Add 0 task 16% of the time, for the low effort and high
effort condition respectively. Participants chose the Add-3 task significantly less than chance, (M
= .45, SD = .29), t(143) = -2.17, p = .03, d = -.18. Individuals picked Add-3 more often in the
high effort (M = .57, SD = .27) compared to the control condition (M = .35, SD = .25), t(89.74) =
4.1, p < 0.001, d = .84 and the low effort (M = .43, SD = .32) condition, t(90.19) = 2.27, p = .03,
d = .47, but there was no significant difference between the low effort and control condition.
These findings suggest that the persuasiveness of our manipulation was not to blame for not
being able to lower the effort preferences of those in the low-effort condition, rather it suggests
that there may indeed be a limit to individuals' effort aversion.
Study 5: Far Transfer
We next aimed to test whether the phenomenon would remain if individuals were told about the
behaviour of past participants doing an unrelated effort task. Participants were told that past
participants had the choice between a colour naming task where they named the colour on the
screen and an incongruent Stroop task where they had to name the colour the word was printed
in. This task was irrelevant to the task individuals were to complete. Individuals first practised
these two tasks to experience the effort required for each and then they were shown a graph
similar to Study 4 where past participants chose the Colour Naming/Stroop task 84% of the time
and the Stroop/Colour Naming task 16% of the time, for the low effort and high effort condition
respectively. This manipulation resulted in no difference between any of the three conditions (M
high effort = .42, SD high = .31, M low effort = .40, SD low = .25, M control = .43, SD control =
.32). These results provide preliminary evidence that effort choices are influenced by others'
behaviour only when past participants engaged in the same task.
Study 6: Payment as a Demand Characteristic
Participants may have chosen to exert effort as they felt obliged to in order to earn their
compensation and reduce cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957). Cognitive dissonance—the
discomfort of holding inconsistent thoughts and behaviours—may arise when individuals feel
guilty about "slacking off" or consistently choosing the least effortful option, especially when
they are being paid; thus, motivating them to choose the more effortful task. If this is the case,
then participants who are paid more should experience a stronger drive to choose the effortful
task even more. To test this, we randomly assigned participants to receive information on their
over compensation. We did this by telling individuals that they “are among a select group
randomly chosen to complete the short version of this survey. While most surveys take about 45
minutes, yours will take only around 15 minutes. You'll still receive 0.5 credits, effectively being
paid double for your time.”
Importantly, there was no difference in proportion of Add-3 choices between individuals who
were told they were overcompensated and individuals who were given no information about
compensation levels. Thus, we do not find evidence that people sometimes prefer to exert effort
because they feel obliged to the experimenter who is paying them. We did find results that
replicated our past studies. Participants chose the Add-3 task significantly less than chance, (M =
.40, SD = .29), t(183) = -4.55, p < 0.001, d = -.34. Individuals picked Add-3 more often in the
high effort (M = .5, SD = .3) compared to the control condition (M = .37, SD = .27), t(107.38) =
2.4, p = .02, d = .45 and the low effort (M = .36, SD = .29) condition, t(110.26) = 2.5, p = .014, d
= .46, but there was no significant difference between the low effort and control condition.
Study 7: Physical Effort
To test whether our findings from the Add-N task generalise to other types of effort, we
examined if physical effort choices were similarly influenced by the decisions of previous
participants. In this study, individuals completed 20 trials where they chose between a high-effort
physical task—clicking a button 70 times within 10 seconds—and a low-effort physical
task—clicking a button 20 times within 10 seconds. As in previous studies, participants were
randomly assigned to one of three conditions: high effort, low effort, or control. In the high effort
condition, participants were informed that past participants chose the high effort task 84% of the
time and the low effort task 16% of the time. In the low effort condition, individuals were
informed that past participants chose the low effort task 84% of the time and the high effort task
16% of the time. .
Once again, we found participants chose the high effort task significantly less than chance, (M =
.42, SD = .26), t(187) = -4.15, p < 0.001, d = -.3, and that individuals picked the high effort task
more often in the high effort (M = .5, SD = .26) compared to the control condition (M = .35, SD
= .22), t(109.89) = 3.29, p = .001, d = .61. There was no significant difference between the low
effort (M = .42, SD = .27) condition and the other conditions. These results demonstrate that the
effort contagion effect generalizes to physical effort tasks.
Study 8: Far Transfer Take 2
We revisited whether individuals’ effort choices are influenced by the effort preferences of others
performing an unrelated task. Our initial attempt to test this effect may have fallen short because
the color-naming task used was an ineffective manipulation. Building on findings that both
physical and cognitive effort preferences affect effort choices, we tested whether preferences for
physical effort could influence cognitive effort decisions.
Participants completed 20 trials of the Add-0/Add-3 task, where they chose between the
low-effort Add-0 deck and the high-effort Add-3 deck. Before the task, participants were
informed about the effort preferences of others completing the physical effort task from Study 7
(button-clicking). In the high- and low-effort conditions, participants were told that past
participants chose the high/low physical effort task 84% of the time and the low/high physical
effort task 16% of the time, respectively. Once again we found that the far transfer manipulation
resulted in no difference in effort preferences between any of the three conditions (M high effort
= .38, SD high = .31, M low effort = .36, SD low = .28, M control = .32, SD control = .28).
These results provide further evidence that effort contagion is only effective when participants
hear about the behaviour of past participants engaging in the same task.
Meta-Analysis: Effort Choices
our findings, we ran a random-effects meta-analysis using the mean proportion of Add-3 choices
across studies. The results showed that overall, participants did not consistently avoid effort by
default. On the contrary, participants chose effort significantly more often than chance, although
the overall effect size was small (d = 0.21, 95% CI [0.00, 0.41], z = 1.98, p = 0.047). This
suggests that while effort aversion is evident in some contexts, participants are willing to engage
in effortful tasks under certain conditions.
each study, along with their 95% confidence intervals. The plot reveals variability across studies,
with some studies showing higher effort choices than others. This heterogeneity underscores the
importance of considering contextual and experimental factors when interpreting these results.
Additionally, we examined pairwise comparisons of effort choices between the high effort, low
effort, and control conditions across studies. Random-effects meta-analyses revealed that
participants chose high-effort tasks significantly more often in the High Effort condition
compared to the low effort condition (d = 0.28, 95% CI [0.13, 0.43], z = 3.49, p < 0.001).
Similarly, participants in the high effort condition chose high-effort tasks more often than those
in the control condition (d = 0.39, 95% CI [0.24, 0.54], z = 5.02, p < 0.001). However, there was
no significant difference between the low Effort and control conditions (d = 0.10, 95% CI [-0.05,
0.25], z = 1.30, p = 0.195).
These results suggest that participants’ effort choices are sensitive to the specific task
manipulations and that the high effort condition reliably increases the likelihood of effortful
choices. The variability in effect sizes across studies highlights the importance of replicating
these findings in diverse contexts.
We examined how participants' effort choices changed over the course of the studies by fitting a
generalized linear mixed-effects model with trials nested within participants. In addition, we
tested whether this relationship varied by condition (high effort, control, and low effort).
Results showed that participants were significantly less likely to choose the high-effort option as
trials progressed. Across all conditions, the odds of choosing high effort decreased by
approximately 3% for each additional trial (odds ratio = 0.97, 95% CI [0.96, 0.97], p < .001).
This pattern of increasing effort avoidance over time is consistent with prior research on the
aversiveness of effort.
We also found that effort choices differed significantly by condition. Participants in the control
condition were less likely to choose high-effort options at baseline compared to the high effort
condition (odds ratio = 0.66, 95% CI [0.52, 0.83], p < .001). Participants in the low effort
condition exhibited a similar pattern but the difference was not statistically significant (odds ratio
= 0.84, 95% CI [0.67, 1.05], p = .13).
Critically, the decline in high-effort choices over trials was significantly steeper in both the low
effort and control conditions compared to the high effort condition. Specifically, the odds of
choosing high effort decreased an additional 2.6% per trial in the low effort condition
(interaction odds ratio = 0.97, 95% CI [0.96, 0.98], p < .001) and 1.8% per trial in the control
condition (interaction odds ratio = 0.98, 95% CI [0.97, 0.99], p = .002) relative to the high effort
condition. These results suggest that while participants generally avoided effort over time, the
rate of avoidance was moderated by the effort condition, with a more gradual decline in effortful
choices in the high effort condition.
Discussion
People prefer to exert less effort whenever possible. However, we are also profoundly influenced
by the actions of those around us. This study asked whether human laziness—our natural
tendency to avoid effort—is socially contagious. Using binary choice tasks, participants
repeatedly chose between a high-effort task and a low-effort task. We found that hearing or
seeing others select the harder option consistently inspired individuals to exert more effort than
they typically would. However, when participants were exposed to others who preferred the
easier task, their own effort preferences did not decline below baseline levels. In other words,
social norms promoting effort can push us to work harder, but there seems to be a floor to how
lazy we’re willing to become.
Comparing effort preferences among individuals exposed to effort-seeking, effort-averse, or no
social information offers insights into the drivers behind decisions to exert or conserve effort.
Our results revealed that people increased their effort when informed that this was the norm but
did not reduce their effort when exposed to low-effort norms (Studies 1–4, 6, 7). This pattern
held whether individuals heard about (Studies 1, 6, 7) or directly observed (Study 2) others'
effort preferences and even when they were informed about the effort choices that others actively
avoided (Study 3). However, we found no evidence that the effort preferences of individuals
engaged in unrelated tasks influenced participants' own effort choices (Study 5, 8). These
findings suggest that people are willing to align their effort preferences with favourable norms,
but only when those norms are directly relevant to the task at hand. This asymmetry challenges
the notion that people blindly conform to the behavior of others. Instead, it suggests that
individuals resist embracing norms that conflict with their self-image or values, even when those
norms might reduce their workload.
How Does Social Norms Impact Effort?
People are often effort-averse, seeking to minimise cognitive and physical exertion whenever
possible. However, the presence of social norms introduces additional factors that may influence
effort preferences. High-effort norms likely succeed because they align with socially desirable
traits, such as diligence, competence, and persistence. When participants see others working
hard, they may view it as the "right" choice, particularly in ambiguous situations where no
explicit rewards or penalties are provided. High-effort norms reduce uncertainty and provide
clear guidance about socially acceptable behavior. This aligns with theories suggesting that
people rely on social cues to navigate uncertain contexts (Cialdini & Trost, 1998).
Low-effort norms, however, lack the same persuasive power. While choosing the easier task may
conserve energy, it offers few social or psychological benefits. Selecting the easier option could
even conflict with an individual’s self-concept, as most people avoid appearing lazy or
unmotivated, even in private settings. These findings challenge the notion that individuals
blindly conform to social norms and instead suggest a resistance to norms that threaten
self-image.
From a cost-benefit perspective, the opportunity costs associated with high- versus low-effort
norms may also play a role. High-effort norms may be perceived as offering potential long-term
benefits, such as skill development or social approval, while the benefits of low-effort norms are
less apparent. This asymmetry may reduce the appeal of conforming to low-effort norms and
contribute to the observed ceiling—or floor—of effort aversion.
Alternative Explanations and Limitations
There are several possible alternative explanations for our findings. One possibility is that
participants chose the effortful task instead of the easier option due to demand characteristics.
Specifically, because they were compensated for their participation, selecting the less effortful
task might have evoked cognitive dissonance, prompting them to feel obligated to exert more
effort to alleviate this discomfort. However, we find this explanation unlikely. In Study 6, we
manipulated the level of payment and found no significant differences in effort choices. If
choices were primarily driven by a sense of obligation tied to compensation, we would expect
that offering a 50% higher payment would amplify this obligation and increase effortful choices.
Our results did not support this hypothesis. That said, the type of compensation may have played
a role—monetary payment, as opposed to course credit, might be more salient, potentially
making a 50% increase more influential.
Additionally, in Studies 3–8, we found either no difference between conditions or that high effort
and low effort conditions scored significantly lower than the control condition on the measure “I
picked the task that would make me look good to the researcher.” We also attempted to minimise
demand characteristics by explicitly informing participants that they should feel free to choose
either option. While we cannot rule out the influence of demand characteristics entirely, our
results provide no evidence to support this explanation.
Another alternative explanation is that participants may not have shown effort avoidance because
the less effortful task was perceived as boring. Previous research suggests that boredom can be
more aversive than effort (Wu et al., 2022). However, we find it unlikely that boredom avoidance
drove choices in our study. In Study 3, participants reported whether their choice was based on
task interest, and no differences were observed between conditions. Similarly, in Studies 2–8,
there were no differences in whether participants selected a task based on enjoyment. These
findings suggest that the less effortful task was not avoided due to boredom.
Our studies are not without limitations. First, the social influence manipulations we employed
relied heavily on descriptive norms conveyed through simplified visuals or testimonials (e.g., bar
graphs, video demonstrations). While these manipulations were effective in influencing effort
preferences, they may not fully capture the complexity of social influence in real-world contexts,
where norms are often ambiguous and influenced by multiple factors, including direct
interactions and group dynamics. Future research could explore how these findings extend to
more complex or interactive social settings.
Second, our paradigm lacked any direct social consequences for participants’ effort choices.
Participants were aware that their decisions were private and would not be observed or evaluated
by others. In real-world settings, effort decisions often occur in contexts where choices are
visible to peers, colleagues, or supervisors, which could amplify the influence of social norms
due to concerns about reputation or social approval. The absence of such external accountability
in our studies may have muted the effects of social norms, particularly in the low-effort
condition, where participants may have felt less pressure to conform without the risk of social
judgement. Future research could examine whether public versus private contexts amplify or
diminish the effects of social norms on effort preferences.
Third, the tasks we used to operationalize effort (e.g., Add-N tasks and button-press tasks) may
not generalise to other types of effort. While Study 7 tested physical effort, the choice between
simple repetitive actions may not fully capture the decision-making processes involved in more
cognitively or emotionally demanding tasks. Extending these paradigms to more diverse forms
of effort could provide a more comprehensive understanding of how social influence shapes
effort preferences.
Finally, we primarily tested our hypotheses in controlled, abstract settings, where participants
made binary choices between predefined tasks. While these paradigms allow for precision in
testing effort preferences, they may lack ecological validity. Real-world effort decisions often
involve more nuanced trade-offs and competing demands, which are not fully captured in our
study design. Future research should consider testing these effects in more naturalistic settings to
assess their applicability to everyday effort decisions.
Additionally, our sample consisted largely of university students and online participants, which
limits the generalizability of our findings. Social norms surrounding effort and laziness may vary
across cultural and socioeconomic contexts, and the responses observed in our studies may not
reflect universal tendencies. Replicating these findings with more diverse populations would
provide stronger evidence for the generalizability of our conclusions.
Implications and Future Directions
These findings underscore the role of social norms in shaping effort preferences, with important
implications for understanding human motivation in social contexts. High-effort norms appear to
counteract the natural tendency to avoid effort, suggesting that such norms could be leveraged to
increase productivity and engagement in educational or workplace settings. Additionally, the
limited influence of low-effort norms highlights the boundaries of social influence, suggesting
that working alongside lazy others may not be consequential to effort and productivity. These
findings can inform interventions in co-working spaces, classrooms, and offices by designing
layouts or introducing mechanisms that foster high-effort norms, which may improve overall
productivity and engagement.
Future research should investigate the interplay between social norms, effort, and social
consequences to better understand how social norms influence effort in ecologically valid
instances. Examining these dynamics across tasks and contexts would also provide valuable
insights into the generalizability of these findings.
Conclusion
Effort is aversive, but it’s also profoundly social. Our findings demonstrate that social norms
promoting hard work can inspire greater effort, while norms encouraging laziness have limited
influence. This asymmetry suggests that humans are not indiscriminately effort-averse; instead,
we resist lowering effort below a certain baseline, even when given social permission. These
findings underscore the power of social influence in shaping behavior and highlight the
boundaries of effort aversion, offering new insights into human motivation in social contexts.
