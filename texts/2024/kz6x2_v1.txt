THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 2
Abstract
Objective: The aim of this study was to contribute to the understanding of the gender
equality paradox by examining within-country variation in the size of the gender/sex gap in the
Five-Factor Model (FFM) personality traits within three geographically large and socially
diverse countries and to explore whether gender/sex differences in personality trait scores across
regions in these countries were associated with various regional-level indicators.
Method: Multilevel analysis was conducted to assess regional gender/sex differences in
FFM personality trait scores using data from Germany (three samples), Russia (one sample), and
the United States (two samples). When the gender/sex gap varied across regions, we assessed
whether this variation was explained by regional indices of human development and its
subcomponents, gender equality, individualism/collectivism, and survival/self-expression values.
Results: Significant regional differences were observed for Openness and Conscientiousness
across most samples, with further multilevel analysis revealing significant gender/sex differences
in these two traits. These differences were explained by regional educational attainment in four
out of seven samples.
Conclusions: Some evidence of a within-country gender-equality paradox was found for
Openness and Conscientiousness, with higher regional educational attainment associated with
widening gender/sex gaps in these traits.
Keywords: gender/sex gap, FFM personality traits, within-country, regional indicators

Does the Gender Equality Paradox in Personality Manifest at the Within-country Regional
Level? Insights from Germany, Russia, and the United States
Gender/sex differences in psychological outcomes have been widely investigated, though
their magnitude remains the subject of considerable debate. While men and women are generally
more similar than different across the variables studied, gender/sex differences in behavioral
patterns do exist and are not trivial (Balducci, 2023; Schmitt et al., 2017). Gender/sex differences
in personality as measured by the Five-Factor Model (FFM)— one of the most widely used
personality traits models (Costa & McCrae, 2008; Digman, 1990)—have been extensively
documented and are typically small to medium in size (Hyde, 2014; Kajonius & Johnson, 2018;
Zell et al., 2015). Women consistently score higher than men on Neuroticism, Agreeableness
(Costa et al., 2001; Kajonius & Johnson, 2018; McCrae et al., 2005; Murphy et al., 2021;
Schmitt et al., 2008), Extraversion (Lippa, 2010; Weisberg et al., 2011), and Conscientiousness
(Schmitt et al., 2008).
The size of gender/sex differences in FFM personality traits varies significantly across
countries, with more pronounced differences observed in North America and Europe compared
to Africa and Asia (Costa et al., 2001; Kaiser et al., 2020; Lippa et al., 2010; Schmitt et al.,
2008). This phenomenon is known as the gender equality paradox, where gender/sex differences
in personality traits, values (Schwartz & Rubel-Lifschitz, 2009), interests (Stoet & Geary, 2018),
and cognitive abilities (Weber et al., 2014) are found in countries with higher levels of human
development and gender equality. That is, the gender/sex gap appears to be larger in countries
where people have greater economic wealth, longer and healthier lives, more equal access to
knowledge and education, and gender equality in rights and opportunities (Balducci, 2023;
1 Gender/sex in this article refers to the binary classification of men and women.
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 4
Oberleiter et al., 2023; Stoet & Geary, 2020). Other country-level indicators known to contribute
to widening gender/sex differences in FFM personality traits across cultures include higher gross
domestic product (GDP) (Costa et al., 2001), distrust of others, a higher proportion of smoking
women when controlling for GDP (Schmitt et al., 2008), and cultural individualism (Bleidorn,
Schönbrodt, et al., 2016; Kaiser, 2019; Lippa, 2010). Additionally, after controlling for other
relevant variables, gender/sex differences in FFM personality traits are more pronounced in
regions with higher historic food consumption and a lower prevalence of historic pathogens
(Kaiser, 2019)
Despite considerable research into the subject, it is not yet clear how or why
gender/sex differences in personality traits increase as societies become more prosperous,
developed, and egalitarian (Yehya et al., 2024). Since the gender/sex equality paradox does
not align well with the predictions of social role theory (cf., Eagly & Wood, 1999;
Guimond et al., 2007), it is more informative to consider a socio-cultural evolutionary
explanation, specifically the emergently-moderated perspective of gender/sex differences
(Schmitt, 2015), which posits that the key to understanding the gender equality paradox
lies in the socio-cultural elements of the evolutionary process. According to this
perspective, genetic effects are shaped by environmental conditions and social contexts,
leading to a more pronounced expression of sex-specific genes in resource-rich
environments (see Balducci (2023) for a review). Consequently, biologically driven sex
differences in certain characteristics are likely to emerge in contexts characterized by
higher economic development and gender egalitarianism (Schmitt, 2015; Schmitt et al.,
2017).
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 5
Any cross-cultural study, including those investigating gender/sex differences in personality,
is subject to various biases (Allik et al., 2023). For instance, large-scale comparative studies rely
on datasets collected using questionnaires that are translated into and/or adapted for many
different languages. When using these instruments, observed differences in mean-level
personality trait scores across cultures may be influenced by semantic differences or latent issues
resulting from translation rather than true trait differences (cf. Allik et al., 2009). Furthermore,
there are cultural differences in the tendency to provide socially desirable answers or to give
acquiescent or extreme responses (Mõttus et al., 2012). Some studies have shown that women
are more likely to engage in socially desirable and acquiescent responding, whereas extreme
responding seems to be more common among men (Greenleaf, 1992; Heine & Lehman, 1995;
Narayan & Krosnick, 1996; Paulhus, 1991). The extent and nature of these gender/sex
differences in response styles can vary based on cultural context and the measures used. These
variations are largely unexplored, and further research is needed to better understand the
underlying causes and implications of these differences and their potential impact on the gender
equality paradox.
This study aims to contribute to the understanding of the gender equality paradox by
examining within-country variation in the size of the gender/sex gap in personality traits across
three geographically large and socially diverse countries—Germany, Russia, and the United
States. Furthermore, the study explores how this variation relates to regional human
development, gender egalitarianism, individualism/collectivism, and survival/self-expression
values. Previously, research using 76 samples from 62 countries found that between-samples
variation in FFM personality traits was approximately 8.5 times smaller than within-sample
variance (Allik et al., 2017). Other studies have revealed significant within-country variation in
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 6
cultural values, with 70–90% of the variance occurring within countries and only 10–30%
between countries (Steel & Taras, 2010; Taras et al., 2016). Therefore, if a widening gender/sex
gap in personality traits across cultures results from the interaction of innate sex differences and
levels of societal development—whether economic, human, or social—along with its underlying
values, then these country-level findings should also be observable at the regional level within
countries.
Investigating the gender equality paradox in FFM personality traits across multiple countries,
will allow us to control for potential country-specific factors. To this end, we sought datasets
from countries with notable regional variation in human and economic development as well as
cultural values. These datasets needed to include information on participants’ FFM personality
traits, gender, and within-country region of residence. In our initial searches, we identified
potentially suitable secondary datasets from Germany, Italy, Russia, South Africa, the United
Kingdom, and the United States. However, some datasets, such as the one from Italy (Klimstra et
al., 2011), had insufficient participants across regions to permit within-country region-level
analysis. Additionally, datasets from the UK (Reimers, 2007) and South Africa (Hill et al., 2013)
were not available for further analysis.
Ultimately, three suitable datasets were identified: the German Socio-Economic Panel
(Goebel et al., 2019), the Russian Character and Personality Survey (Allik et al., 2009) and the
Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment data (Condon & Revelle, 2015; Condon et al., 2017;
Elleman et al., 2018) for US data. These datasets include data on FFM personality traits,
gender/sex, and region of residence from the main regions of each country. The selected
countries—Germany, Russia, and the United States—exhibit significant regional differences in
personality traits (Allik et al., 2009; Elleman et al., 2018; Götz et al., 2020; Obschonka et al.,
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 7
2013; Rentfrow et al., 2013) and notable within-country variations in human development,
gender equality, and cultural values (Chen et al., 2020; Greenfield, 2013; Kaasa et al., 2014;
Norlén et al., 2019; Rau & Schmertmann, 2020; Redler et al., 2021). In the following section, we
review the existing literature on regional differences in FFM personality traits as well as relevant
findings regarding human development, gender egalitarianism, and cultural values in the three
countries.
Within-country Regional Differences in FFM Personality Traits and Regional Indicators
across Three Selected Countries
As reviewed above, the size of the gender/sex gap in FFM personality traits varies at the
cultural level based on a country’s economic and human development, gender egalitarianism,
cultural individualism, and survival/self-expression values (Balducci, 2023; Charles & Bradley,
2009; Costa et al., 2001; Kaiser, 2019; Lippa et al., 2010; Mac Giolla & Kajonius, 2019; Schmitt
et al., 2008). In this study, we will examine the effect of these variables on the size of the
gender/sex gap in FFM personality traits within countries.
First, human development encompasses the extent to which individuals lead a healthy and
productive life, receive an education, and have access to social and economic opportunities
(Chiappero-Martinetti et al., 2015).Within-country regional variation in economic and human
development in the three countries under examination was measured using the Subnational
Human Development Index (SHDI) and its Health, Education, and Income sub-indices, as
reported by Smits and Permanyer (2019), ranging from 0 (low) to 1 (high). Second, the terms
gender egalitarianism and equality are used interchangeably in this paper and refer to the extent
to which men and women have equal access to opportunities in the public sphere (including
education, economic participation, political empowerment, etc.). Various indices are available to
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 8
assess gender equality both between and within countries (Schmid et al., 2022). Our choice of
measures was largely determined by their availability in the countries we investigated. Gender
equality scores, known as the Subnational Gender Development Index (SGDI) for Germany and
the United States, were taken from the same study (Smits & Permanyer, 2019). In the United
States, we also used the Women, Peace, and Security Index (GIWPS, 2020) as a comprehensive
indicator of gender egalitarianism. For Germany, we used the Female Achievement
Index (FemAI) from the Regional Gender Equality Monitor (Norlén et al., 2019) as a second
indicator of gender equality. Despite our best efforts, we were unable to find any regional level
data on gender equality for Russia. Third, individualism/collectivism is the degree to which
individuals within a culture prioritize personal goals over those of the group (Inglehart & Welzel,
2005). Fourth, the survival/self-expression value dimension highlights the contrast between
prioritizing economic and physical security and focusing on subjective well-being, civic
engagement, and individual autonomy (Inglehart & Welzel, 2005). The within-country regional
scores of individualism/collectivism and survival/self-expression values were computed using
data from various waves of the World Values Survey (Beugelsdijk & Welzel, 2018; Haerpfer et
al., 2024; Inglehart & Welzel, 2005).
Regional variation in FFM personality traits within countries such as Germany (Ebert et al.,
2022; Obschonka et al., 2013; Obschonka et al., 2019), Russia (Allik et al., 2009), and the United
States (Ebert et al., 2022; Elleman et al., 2018; Götz et al., 2020; Rentfrow et al., 2013) has been
well documented by previous research and could be attributed to factors such as selective
migration, social influence, and ecological influence (Rentfrow, 2020).
Germany
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 9
populated federal states were North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria, while Bremen and Saarland
were the least populated. SHDI scores in 2005 ranged from 0.88 in Saxony-Anhalt to 0.95 in
Hamburg. The European Regional Gender Equality Monitor report in 2021 indicated substantial
regional disparities in gender equality, with the Female Disadvantage Index (FemDI) ranging
from approximately 18.60 in Berlin to around 38.70 in Hesse. Additionally, the Female
Achievement Index (FemAI) revealed a 10-point difference between Hamburg and Saxony-
Anhalt, with Saxony-Anhalt scoring the lowest among all federal regions (Norlén et al., 2019).
Inequalities have also been observed between regions of former East and West Germany, with,
for example, collectivism scores being modestly higher in the former East (48.9 out of 100)
compared to the former West Germany (46.4) (Stamkou et al., 2019). One of the sub-indices of
the SHDI, the Income Index, also showed significant within-country variation, with the former
East generally scoring lower than the former West in 2015 (Redler et al., 2021).
Differences in FFM personality traits have been observed across federal states, regions and
areas in Germany (Ebert et al., 2022; Obschonka et al., 2019). In densely populated city states
such as Berlin and Hamburg, scores for Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and Openness to
Experience (Openness) tend to be higher, while scores for Agreeableness and Neuroticism tend
to be lower. Higher scores for Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Openness, Agreeableness and
Emotional Stability (the inverse of Neuroticism) have been found in administrative regions with
longer life expectancy and a higher proportion of individuals in managerial occupations.
2 The Federal Statistical Office publishes the official census data on Germany. The data on the federal states are
Population/Tables/population-by-laender.html). The sixteen federal states are: Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Berlin,
Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse, Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, North Rhine, Westphalia,
Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein, and Thuringia.
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 10
Gender/sex differences were controlled for in regional-level analyses (Ebert et al., 2022;
Obschonka et al., 2013), but little is known about gender/sex variation in personality traits across
regions.
Russia
Russia consists of eight federal districts, which together encompass 83 federal subjects , also
known as administrative areas or divisions, including oblasts, republics, krais, autonomous
okrugs, cities of federal significance, and autonomous oblasts. The most populated of these is
Moscow City, while the least populated is Nenets Autonomous Okrug. There is significant
variation in economic development and cultural values across these federal subjects. In 2010,
regional differences in economic development, as measured by the SHDI (Smits & Permanyer,
2019), ranged from 0.72 in the Republic of Tuva to 0.93 in Moscow City. These differences are
th
comparable to the gap in economic development between Jordan (ranked 98 on the HDI in
th
2021) and the United Kingdom (ranked 17 in the same year)(UNDP, 2022). To the best of our
knowledge, there are no indices reporting gender equality scores for Russia’s administrative
subjects. However, significant regional differences in individualism/collectivism scores within
Russia have been noted (Minkov et al., 2023).
A study of 33 administrative areas in Russia found a consistent pattern in FFM personality
traits across the country (Allik et al., 2009). However, district clustering effects were observed,
particularly with Openness, which correlated with the economic development ranking of the
administrative area (r = -.44, p = .009). Gender/sex patterns in the Russian sample were similar
to those found in cross-cultural studies (r = .90, p < .001). Regional-level examinations revealed

that the gender/sex gap in Conscientiousness scores was wider in cities compared to villages. For
Neuroticism, however, the two facets showed opposite trends: the gender/sex difference in
Anxiety was wider in villages, while the difference in Angry Hostility was wider cities (Allik et
al., 2009).
United States
The United States comprises 50 states , with the largest populations in California and Texas,
and the smallest in Wyoming, Alaska, and Hawaii. Significant economic inequalities exist
between states (Alvaredo et al., 2018). In 2023, annual wages per employee in the District of
Columbia (USD 112,087) were more than double those in Mississippi (USD 48,363) . State laws
differ, potentially resulting in more pronounced gender inequality in some states than in others.
In 2017, South Dakota, Iowa, and Oregon had the widest gender/sex income gaps, while
Washington had the smallest (Smits & Permanyer, 2019).
Within-country variation in gender egalitarianism is also evident across different
dimensions, such as women’s participation in the workforce, education, and political
representation, but also women’s security (e.g., gun deaths, intimate partner violence,
community safety, and healthcare affordability) and justice (e.g., legal protection, discriminatory
norms, etc.) (GIWPS, 2020). Based on the GIWPS assessment, Washington, Massachusetts, and
Connecticut were the top three performing states, whereas Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas
were the lowest performers. In Louisiana, for instance, 20% of women live in poverty,
significantly above the national average of 12%. Additionally, southern states tend to exhibit

stronger collectivistic tendencies, in contrast to the mountainous West and Great Plains, where
individualism scores are highest (Vandello & Cohen, 1999).
Regional differences in FFM personality traits across US states have been documented in
several studies (Elleman et al., 2020; Elleman et al., 2018; Rentfrow et al., 2013; Rentfrow et al.,
2008). State-level variations in the FFM personality traits are associated with social indicators
such as social involvement, social and enterprising occupations, religiosity, liberal values, and
health-promoting behaviors. Furthermore, individuals residing in elevated mountainous areas
tend to have higher scores for Openness but lower scores on the other four traits compared to
those in other ecological settings (Götz et al., 2020). These state-level correlations with
geographical indicators align with previous regional analyses of personality traits in the United
States (Elleman et al., 2018; Rentfrow et al., 2013; Rentfrow et al., 2008). However, there is little
knowledge about gender/sex differences in personality traits across the US states and the extent
to which these differences reflect the country-level gender equality paradox.
Taken together, there is strong evidence of within-country variation in FFM personality
traits, human and economic development, gender equality, and cultural values in Germany,
widening of the gender/sex gap in FFM personality traits across regions within these countries is
associated with selected regional-level indicators that support the gender equality paradox
established at the country level.
The Present Study
The main aim of this study is to examine whether the gender equality paradox in FFM
personality traits manifests at the within-country regional level. Not much is known about
within-country gender/sex differences in personality traits in the countries investigated in our
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 13
study—Germany, Russia, and the United States. Therefore, we will first examine within-country
gender/sex differences in FFM personality traits to determine whether the gender/sex gap in
personality traits differs across regions in each of the three countries. If significant within-
country regional variation in men’s and women’s personality traits is found, the study aims to
assess whether these differences are more pronounced in regions with higher levels of economic
and human development, gender equality, and individualistic and self-expression values
compared to regions that score low on these indicators.
The study advances the field and current knowledge in several ways. First, by studying
gender/sex differences between regions within countries, our results will not be affected by
potential culture–gender/sex response biases, as all participants completed the questionnaire in
the same language. Second, rather than examining the gender equality paradox across all
personality traits (e.g., by using the mean level general sex differences index as reported by
Schmitt et al., 2008), the FFM personality traits (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness,
Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness) are assessed separately in the present study (cf. Ilmarinen
& Lönnqvist, 2024). Third, separate analyses are conducted for Germany, Russia, and the United
States, with four samples from Germany and two from the United States. By selecting three
countries and using several datasets from different years (as was the case with the German and
US samples), we are able to test the replicability of the results across different samples and
times. Fourth, since participants completed three FFM personality questionnaires in two
formats—the German version of the 15-item Big Five questionnaire (self-reports), the Russian
version of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R; informant ratings), and the
English version of the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) personality questionnaire (self-
reports)—we are able to examine the replicability of our findings across different Big Five
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 14
personality measures and types of ratings. Fifth, unlike most previous studies, we examined the
subcomponents of the Human Development Index—the Health, Education, and Income Index—
to determine which of these, or all together, most strongly contributed to the widening of the
gender/sex gap across regions.
In line with the gender equality paradox established at the country-level, the hypotheses (H)
of this study are as follows: Gender/sex differences in FFM personality traits will be larger in
within-country administrative regions with higher levels of human development and its
subcomponents (H1), gender egalitarianism (H2), individualism (H3), and self-expression values
(H4) than in administrative regions with lower levels of these indicators. In all analyses,
participants’ age and education will be controlled for, as many studies have shown the impact of
these sociodemographic factors on personality traits (Akyunus et al., 2021; Beck et al., 2023;
Bleidorn et al., 2022; Hang et al., 2021; Mammadov, 2022).
Method
To test the aforementioned hypotheses, data from three large-scale studies from Germany
(Goebel et al., 2019), Russia (Allik et al., 2009), and the United States (Elleman et al., 2018)
were used. The study was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform at
Ethics Committee of the Department of Psychology at the University of Warwick (date of
approval: June 17, 2020).
6 When registering the study, our primary hypothesis was to test whether gender/sex gap in personality traits across
regions of the three countries could be associated with the SHDI of the region. However, after registration of the
study, we opted to test whether other contextual factors were associated with widening of the gender/sex gap in
personality traits across cultures/countries: including gender equality, individualism/collectivism and survival/self-
expression.

Data and Participants
All selected datasets included information on FFM personality traits, gender/sex, and within-
country regions of residence of the participants. Participants with missing data on gender/sex and
region of residence, or with a missing rate of more than 17% on the personality questionnaire
were excluded from the analysis. The inclusion criteria per gender/sex per region within the
datasets were selected differently based on the dataset due to variance in the number of regions
or states across the three countries (see the sub-sections below for further details for each
country). In short, for Germany, Russia, and the United States, regions with at least 100, 40, and
60 participants per gender/sex, respectively, were included.
The datasets from Germany and the United States included multiple waves of data collected
over time; therefore, we opted to run the analysis separately for each sample to ensure within-
country replicability across time. Consequently, the analyses were run on seven samples in total
characteristics, and descriptive statistics of the regional-level indicators for the seven datasets
across the three countries.

German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP)
The German SOEP (Goebel et al., 2019) is a longitudinal social survey of approximately
15,000 private households and 30,000 individuals across the 16 federal states of Germany. The
survey is conducted by the Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung (DIW) Berlin and
includes questions about occupation, household composition, and earnings. The target population
of the SOEP is Germany’s resident population; therefore, the SOEP uses only random
probability samples. Different modes of data collection are employed, with face-to-face
interviews as the default option (for a detailed description of data collection and the sampling
method, please see Goebel et al. (2019)). Data from four waves of the German SOEP (2005,
2009, 2012–2013, and 2017) were used in the present study, as a personality questionnaire was
included in these waves.
The datasets included participants from all 16 federal states. In Bremen and Saarland, the
number of participants was suboptimal (less than 100 per gender/sex group) in the early waves.
Nevertheless, considering that the data were representative of each region, we included all the
regions in our analysis. The German SOEP is a longitudinal representative sample; hence, it is
noteworthy that across the four data samples tested in this study, 51.60% of individuals were
included only once across the four samples, 26.62% were included twice, 8.51% three times, and
13.27% were included in all four samples. Permission for the use of these data was obtained after
signing an agreement with DIW Berlin (November 27, 2019).
all 16 federal states, ranging from 151 participants in Bremen to 4,402 in North Rhine-
Westphalia. The mean age of the participants was 47.31 years (SD = 17.54), and 52.18% were
women.

Across the 16 federal states, sample sizes varied from 151 to 4,176 in Bremen and North Rhine-
Westphalia, respectively. The mean age of the participants was 49.81 years (SD = 17.65), and
52.24% were women.

participants across the 16 federal states. The number of participants ranged from 243 in Bremen
to 6,049 in North Rhine-Westphalia. The mean age of the participants was 47.34 years (SD =
17.35), and 52.29% were women. In this sample, all regions included at least 100 participants per
gender/sex group meeting the proposed inclusion criteria (Allik et al., 2010; Allik et al., 2009;
Allik et al., 2011).
Russian Culture and Personality Survey (CPS)
The Russian CPS (Allik et al., 2010; Allik et al., 2009) data were collected in 33 different
administrative areas of the Russian Federation in 2007–2008 (please see Allik et al. (2009) for
more details of samples and procedure). Participants were asked to rate the personality traits of
someone they knew well (see the Measures section below for further details). They also provided
information regarding the target person’s gender/sex, education, age, and place of residence.
These variables were used in the main analyses as participants reported the targets’ personality
traits rather than their own. Consequently, in cases where participants reported that the target
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 19
resided outside Russia or in a region not included in the study, their data were excluded from the
analysis.
In total, 7,125 individuals took part in the original study, of which 6,476 participants had the
necessary personality and sociodemographic data for the target individual to be included in the
(SD = 20.53), and 50.40% were women. The study encompassed 33 regions, each with a
minimum of 40 participants per gender/sex group, ensuring a diverse selection of regions for
analysis. The sample size varied across regions, with a minimum of 86 target individuals living
in Orel Oblast and Moscow City and a maximum of 515 in Udmurtia.
United States Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment (SAPA)
In the United States, SAPA data (Condon & Revelle, 2015; Condon et al., 2017) were used
to analyze within-country differences in personality traits across different states. The dataset is
available online ; however, permission was obtained from the owners of the data prior to its use
in research. Data were collected online in two waves: from July 2014 to December 2015 (US
SAPA 2014–2015) and from December 2015 to February 2017 (US SAPA 2015–2017). The
regional inclusion criteria required a minimum of 100 participants per gender/sex group per state,
following the guidelines set by previous studies (Bleidorn, Arslan, et al., 2016; Bleidorn et al.,
2013; Gebauer et al., 2014).
The US SAPA 2014–2015 dataset initially included 54,856 participants (Supplementary
individuals with missing information regarding their state of residence, or gender/sex, or with
more than 17% missing data on the personality questionnaire, were also excluded from the

analysis. Consequently, a total of 25,056 participants were included in this study. The mean age
of the participants was 25.81 years (SD = 10.98), and 66.82% were women. The participants
were from 32 states, and the sample sizes within these states ranged from 231 (Connecticut) to
3,227 (California).
The US SAPA 2015–2017 dataset initially comprised 48,350 participants (Supplementary
included 20,803 participants from 31 states. The number of participants varied across states,
from 200 in South Carolina to 2,746 in California. The mean age of the participants was 25.28
years (SD = 11.04), and 66.36% were women.
Measures
Personality Questionnaire
In each country, the FFM personality traits (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to
Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness) were assessed using different Big Five
questionnaires. Regardless of the questionnaire used, higher scores on Neuroticism imply that the
person worries a lot and gets nervous easily. Higher Extraversion scores indicate that the person
is outgoing and talkative. Individuals with original ideas and an active imagination score high on
Openness. Those who are forgiving, kind, and rarely rude score high on Agreeableness. Finally,
higher scores on Conscientiousness suggest that the individual is efficient and thorough in their
work.
German SOEP. In the German SOEP, personality traits were measured using the German
version of the 15-item Big Five questionnaire (Gerlitz & Schupp, 2005; Hahn et al., 2012; Lang
et al., 2011; Richter et al., 2017). Each of the five personality domains was evaluated with three
items, and participants were asked to rate the extent to which each item applied to them on a
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 21
seven-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (“does not apply”) to 7 (“apply fully”). The internal
reliability scores for the German SOEP samples were previously reported by Gerlitz and Schupp
(2005). Internal consistency reliability estimates of the FFM domains across the four samples in
this study ranged from 0.59 to 0.62 for Neuroticism, 0.66 to 0.83 for Extraversion, 0.59 to 0.63
for Openness, 0.46 to 0.51 for Agreeableness, and 0.59 to 0.62 for Conscientiousness. The
average score of the three items was calculated for each FFM personality trait, with higher scores
suggesting higher levels of Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and
Conscientiousness.
Russian CPS. In the Russian CPS, the informant-rated version of the Russian NEO PI-R
(Martin et al., 2002) was used to assess the FFM personality traits. Participants were randomly
assigned to one of four conditions and asked to rate the personality traits of either (a) a young
man aged 17–23 years, (b) a young woman aged 17–23 years, (c) a man aged over 50 years, or
(d) a woman aged over 50 years. Participants were instructed that this person should be a native
Russian who had lived most of their life in the region, where the participant resided. The target
person could be a friend, relative, or neighbor, and could be someone they liked or disliked.
Participants provided demographic information about their target (age, gender/sex, education,
and place of residence) before completing the 240-item personality questionnaire on a five-point
Likert type scale, ranging between 0 (“strongly disagree”) to 4 (“strongly agree”). Each FFM
domain score was the sum of the 48 items, with higher scores indicating higher levels of FFM
personality traits. The internal consistency reliability estimates (i.e. Cronbach alphas) for the
NEO PI-R domains in this study were 0.76, 0.83, 0.73, 0.85, and 0.91 for Neuroticism,
Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, respectively. (For further details
on the reliability estimates in the original study, see Allik et al. (2009)).
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 22
US SAPA. The IPIP personality questionnaire (Johnson, 2014) was used in the US SAPA
study, encompassing 696 items randomly assigned to participants. For this study, a subset of 300
NEO-IPIP questions was used to assess the FFM personality traits. Each of the five traits was
represented by an average of 60 items rated on a six-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (“very
inaccurate”) to 6 (“very accurate”) with higher scores indicating higher levels of Neuroticism,
Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. The mean Cronbach’s alpha
values were 0.95, 0.92, 0.92, 0.90, and 0.92 for Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness,
Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, respectively (Maples et al., 2014).
Sociodemographic Variables
Gender/Sex. In all samples, participants reported their gender/sex as either man (0) or
woman (1). Russian participants also reported the gender/sex of their target person using the
same two categories.
Age. In the German SOEP, age was calculated based on the participant’s date of birth
relative to the year of data collection. In the Russian CPS, participants reported the age of their
targets. In the US SAPA dataset, age was self-reported.
Education. Participants’ educational levels were recorded in all studies, but different
country-specific indicators were used. This variable was harmonized across all samples into
three categories: primary education (1), secondary and secondary vocational education (2), and
higher education (i.e., university or college degree) (3).
In the German SOEP, participants’ educational progress was tracked across multiple waves.
Following the categorization by Gries et al. (2022), participants’ education was divided into

attend either Hauptschule, Realschule or Gymnasium schools. Gymnasium is categorized as a high school, whereas
the other two are considered below high school. After Gymnasium, students can choose to earn a range of college-

three categories: below high school (1), high school (including vocational) (2), and higher than
high school (3). Across the five samples, the percentage of participants who completed
secondary education was the highest and the percentage of participants who completed primary
In the Russian CPS, participants selected their target individual’s educational level from six
options: primary (1), unfinished secondary (2), secondary (3), trade or vocational school (4),
more than three years of unfinished higher education (5), and higher education or university (6).
These were coded as primary education (primary, unfinished secondary), secondary education
(secondary, trade or vocational school, or more than three years of unfinished higher education),
and higher education (higher education or university). The percentages of target individuals who
had completed primary, secondary, and higher education were 9.39%, 65.73%, and 24.88%,
respectively.
In the US SAPA, participants reported their level of education from seven options: less than
12 years, high school graduate, currently in college or university, attended college or university
but did not graduate, college or university degree, currently in graduate or professional school,
and professional school degree graduate. These were categorized into primary education (less
than 12 years), secondary education (high school graduate, currently in college or university, and
some college or university but did not graduate), and higher education (college or university
degree, currently in graduate or professional school, and professional school degree graduate). In
the US SAPA 2014–2015 dataset, 17.91% of participants had primary education, 59.89% had
secondary education, and 22.20% had higher education. In the US SAPA 2015–2017 dataset,

categories: below high school (1), high school (including vocational) (2) and higher than high school (3).
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 24
20.29% had primary education, 56.89% had secondary education, and 22.82% had higher
education.
Within-country Regions. In the German SOEP, participants were randomly selected based
on census data from each federal state, and this information was included in the dataset. In the
Russian CPS, participants reported their target’s current place of residence, which was coded to
match one of the 46 administrative territories. In the US SAPA study, participants reported
which US state they were residing in.
Regional Level Indicators
The following major regional entities were analyzed: 16 federal states in Germany, 46
administrative territories in Russia, and 50 states in the United States. Region-level scores for the
following indicators across the three countries and seven samples are presented in
Supplementary Tables 1–7.
Subnational Human Development Index (SHDI). The SHDI for the federal states of
Germany and the US states was extracted from Smits and Permanyer (2019). The main sources
of these indicators were Eurostat, UNDP, and the Global Data Lab–Area Database (Permanyer &
Smits, 2020). Similar to the country-level HDI (UNDP, 2022), the SHDI is a composite of three
dimensions: education, health, and standard of living. Education was measured by the average
years of schooling for adults and the expected years of schooling for individuals under 18 years
of age. The health dimension was based on the life expectancy at birth, while the standard of
living was calculated based on the gross national income per capita.
In our analyses, we used both the SHDI and its components: the Health, Education, and
Income indices. The selected years matched the individual data-collection periods. For instance,
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 25
in Germany, SOEP data collected in 2005 was matched with the SHDI for federal states in 2005.
In datasets where individual data collection spanned multiple years, the SHDI was averaged
across those years. The SHDI for Russia included in the Permanyer and Smits (2020) dataset was
provided for eight federal districts. However, to ensure a sufficient number of regions for the
multilevel analysis, we opted to run the analyses on administrative territories subsumed under
larger federal districts. Thus, a different resource for the economic development of the regions or
territories was used in Russia. In 2010, the UNDP reported the economic development of
Russia’s regions and territories using the same formulas for country-level HDI.
Gender Equality. The Subnational Gender Development Index (SGDI) is based on the ratio
of women-to-men across the three HDI dimensions (health, education, and estimated income)
(UNDP ). The SGDI ranges from 0 to 1, with lower scores indicating a worse position for
women. The SGDI was available for 16 federal states in Germany and 50 states in the United
States. For Russia, SGDI data were only available for the eight federal districts and not for the 33
administrative territories from which individual data were collected (Allik et al., 2009).
Two other gender equality measures were included in the study, one for the GSOEP and
another for the US SAPA samples. The Regional Gender Equality Monitor (RGEM) indices
(Norlén et al., 2019) were used to assess gender equality across German federal states. The
RGEM consists of two composite indices: the Female Achievement Index (FemAI) and
the Female Disadvantage Index (FemDI), which measure two complementary aspects of gender
11 The UNDP report in 2010 titled “National Human Development Report in the Russian Federation 2010:
Millennium Development Goals in Russia: Looking into the future” is available at:
development-goals-russia
12 The full data on the Subnational Gender Development Index are available at:
dn7j?locale=en
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 26
equality. FemAI assesses “the female level of achievement compared to the best regional female
performance” (0 = lowest performance; 100 = best performance), while FemDI measures “the
female disadvantage by measuring regional differences when women are doing worse than men”
(0 = no disadvantage; 100 = largest disadvantage). FemAI and FemDI were highly correlated [r
= - 0.75, p < .001, 95% Confidence Intervals: (-0.754, -0.742)] across German states, so only the
FemAI was used in the analysis.
The Women, Peace, and Security (GIWPS) index was used as the second gender equality
indicator for US states (GIWPS, 2020). This index captures three basic aspects of women’s well-
being: security (e.g., intimate partner violence, gun deaths, community safety), justice (e.g., legal
protection, discriminatory norms, maternal mortality), and inclusion (e.g., employment,
percentage of poverty rates and college degrees etc.). The GIWPS index is based on 11
indicators, and its scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores representing a better state for
women in terms of security, inclusion, and justice.
Cultural Values. The indices of individualism/collectivism (Beugelsdijk & Welzel, 2018)
and survival/self-expression values (Inglehart & Welzel, 2005) were used to measure the within-
country regional differences in cultural values. Individualism/collectivism reflects the extent to
which individuals prioritize personal goals over group-oriented ones. To measure this, we
followed the approach of Beugelsdijk and Welzel (2018), who synthesized Hofstede’s
dimensional and Inglehart’s concepts of culture and proposed a new indicator of
individualism/collectivism using the World Values Survey (WVS) data. Higher scores indicate
higher levels of individualism.
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 27
The survival/self-expression value dimension refers to the emphasis on economic and
physical security (survival) versus on subjective well-being, civic activism, and individual
autonomy (self-expression)(Inglehart & Welzel, 2005). The survival/self-expression index was
based on the four-item Materialistic/Postmaterialist Values Index, as well as questions on the
extent to which homosexuality is justifiable, and whether participants have signed a petition and
generally trust other people (Inglehart & Welzel, 2005). Higher scores indicate greater support
for self-expression values.
Within-country regional scores of individualism/collectivism and survival/self-expression
were computed using WVS data (Haerpfer et al., 2020). Aggregated regional level scores for
these value dimensions in the German SOEP 2005 and 2009 samples were based on data from
the WVS 5th wave (2005-2009), which was collected in Germany in 2006. For the German
SOEP 2012-2013 and 2017 samples, state-level scores for the two value dimensions were
computed using the WVS 7th wave data (2017-2021), collected in Germany in 2017-2018. The
WVS 7th wave data (2017-2021) were also used to compute individualism/collectivism and
survival/self-expression scores for Russian administrative units (collected in 2017) and US
states (collected in 2017).
Statistical Analysis
To assess whether within-country gender/sex differences in FFM personality traits are larger
in regions with higher levels of economic and human development, gender equality, and
individualistic and self-expression values (compared to regions with lower scores on these
indicators), we conducted a series of multilevel analyses separately for each of the five FFM
personality traits. For replicability, these analyses were run separately for each of the seven
15 In Russia, the decision to use the data from the 7th wave of the WVS (2017-2021) was based on the absence of
regional information in the prior WVS data collection waves.

samples: four from Germany (German SOEP 2005, 2009, 2012–2013, and 2017), one from
Russia (Russian CPS), and two from the United States (US SAPA 2014–2015 and 2015–2017).
All multilevel random coefficient models were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood in
IBM SPSS (version 28), with a significance level set at p < .05.
Level 1 represented individual-level variation within regions, while Level 2 represented
regional variations within a country. At Level 2, regional indicators were analyzed to determine
their association with the gender/sex gap in FFM personality traits. These regional indicators
included economic and human development (measured by SHDI for Germany and the US , and
UNDP HDI for Russia), sub-indices of SHDI (Health, Education, and Income, where available),
gender equality measures (SGDI for the US and Germany, GIWPS index for the US , and FemAI
for Germany), and cultural value dimensions (individualism/collectivism and survival/self-
expression). All individual and regional variables were grand-mean centered.
Model 0
We first ran a series of random coefficient regression models to examine relationships
between FFM personality traits and gender/sex across regions within each country. All Level 1
variables, including the FFM personality trait scores, were centered using the grand-mean
centering method. The purpose of these models was to capture the degree to which personality
trait scores varied across regions. The fixed effects were represented by  values, while the
random effects (error terms e and u) accounted for deviations. The initial model (Model 0) was
as follows:
y =  + u + e [Model 0]
ij 00 0j ij
Here, y represents the personality trait score for individual i in region j, while the intercept

 represents the grand mean of the personality trait score across the population of j regions. The

random effects e , u , and u had estimated variances σ , τ , and τ , respectively. The random

0j
and e represents individual-level deviations of personality trait scores from the predicted

regional average.
To assess the significance of the random effects, we calculated the intraclass correlation
coefficient (ICC) using Lorah (2018) method:
2 2 2
ICC = τ /(τ +σ )
The ICC represents the proportion of variance in personality trait scores attributable to
regional differences (Lorah, 2018). The ICC can be used to compute the size of the design effect
(DEFF), which determines whether sufficient Level 2 variation exists to warrant multilevel
modelling (Huang, 2018). DEFF is a function of ICC and the average Level 2 unit size and was
computed using Kish’s (1965) formula, where n is the harmonic mean of the Level 2 unit size:
DEFF = 1 + (n – 1) x ICC
A DEFF value of at least 1.5 suggests multilevel modeling is appropriate (Huang, 2018; Lai
& Kwok, 2015; Sommet & Morselli, 2021). DEFF was calculated for each sample separately
Model 1
The primary aim of this study was to determine the degree to which gender/sex differences
in personality trait scores vary across the studied regions. The model allowed the intercept and
slope to vary at Level 2 to estimate regional differences in FFM personality traits and gender/sex
effects.

Model 2 extended Model 1, by adjusting for the effects of age and education, and was
specified as follows: y =  +  (Gender/Sex ) +  (Age ) +  (Education ) + u +

u (Education ), and e were also included.

Model 3
Model 3 incorporated a cross-level interaction between individual-level variables
(gender/sex, age, and education) and regional indicators to examine the moderating effect of
regional indicators on gender/sex differences in personality traits, while adjusting for age and
education. The aim was to determine whether the relationships between gender/sex and FFM
personality traits across regions varied as a function of regional indicators. Regional indicators
were added separately to consecutive models. The formula for Model 3 was as follows:
y =  +  (Gender/Sex ) +  (Age ) +  (Education ) +  (Regional Indicator ) +
ij 00 10 ij 20 ij 30 ij 01 j

j regions; the main effects of gender/sex ( ), age ( ), and education ( ); the main effect of

indicators and gender/sex ( ). Random variance components were included for gender/sex, age,
and education, as in previous models.
Results
We first report on the analysis assessing regional variance in personality traits (Model 0),
followed by an examination of gender/sex differences in personality traits across regions (Model
1), while controlling for age and education at the individual level (Model 2). Finally, we explore
the associations between gender/sex differences and the FFM personality traits in relation to
regional indicators (Model 3).
Within-country Regional Variance in Personality Traits
In Model 0, we evaluated the variance in grand-centered personality traits across regions for
8, the results of this analysis showed significant variations ( p < .05) in personality trait scores
across regions as indicated by Wald Z in the following samples: Neuroticism (German SOEP
2005 and 2017, Russian CPS, and US SAPA 2014–2015), Extraversion (Russian CPS and US
SAPA 2014–2015), Openness (in all samples except German SOEP 2012–2013), Agreeableness
(German SOEP 2017 and Russian CPS ), and Conscientiousness (in all samples).
Next, the ICC was calculated to determine the percentage of within-country variation in
FFM personality traits across the regions. The results showed that across all samples, the ICC
ranged from 0.28% (Openness) to 2.37% (Neuroticism) in the Russian CPS sample. All
samples that exhibited significant variations in personality traits across regions, as indicated by
16 In the OSF pre-registration form, we stated that typically, a minimum of 10% of variation across clusters is
necessary for conducting a multilevel analysis (MLM) and that we will use this criterion to determine the feasibility
of MLM. However, after further review of MLM conditions, we also considered the significance of the number of
participants within Level 2 categories as a factor in deciding whether to proceed with multilevel analysis.

presents the harmonic mean, ICC, and DEFF for each sample and FFM personality trait. Further
analysis (i.e., Model 1) was conducted exclusively for these samples and personality traits.
Within-country Regional Variance in the Gender/Sex Gap in Personality Traits
The magnitude of within-country gender/sex differences varied significantly (p < .05) across
regions in the assessed samples and personality traits, as indicated by the Model 1 analysis
(Tables 2–6). Age and education were subsequently added to the model to examine whether
regional variations in the gender/sex gap in personality traits persisted after controlling for these
demographic variables (Model 2).
The results indicated that age was a significant predictor of regional variation in personality
traits across all samples (p < .05). Similarly, education was also a significant predictor across all
samples except for the German SOEP 2012–2013, where it failed to explain the regional
variability in Conscientiousness scores (p > .05). Consequently, the education variable was
excluded from Model 3 for this sample.
Regional Indicators and the Gender/Sex Gap in Personality Traits
In Model 3, we examined the interaction effects of gender/sex and the regional indicators
considered in this study. As mentioned above, each regional indicator, including the sub-indices
of HDI, was tested in separate models. Model 3 was run eight times, with each iteration
incorporating one of the regional indicators (Model 3a: SHDI, Model 3b: SHDI Health Index,
Model 3c: SHDI Education Index, Model 3d: SHDI Income Index, Model 3e: SGDI, Model 3f/g:
FemAI (Germany SOEP) or GIWPS (the United States SAPA), Model 3h:
Individualism/Collectivism, and Model 3i: Survival/Self-expression). The results of these
analyses showed the gender/sex differences and the interactions between regional indicators and
gender/sex differences for each of the FFM personality traits.
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 33
Neuroticism
For Neuroticism, Model 3 was run on the following four samples: German SOEP 2005 and
2017, Russian CPS, and US SAPA 2014–2015. As expected, the results from the Model 2
analyses showed significant gender/sex differences across regions, even after controlling for age
and regional indicators emerged in the German SOEP 2005 sample. Specifically, the SHDI
expression values score (β = -0.09, SE = .04, p = .016) interacted with gender/sex in predicting
Neuroticism. The gender/sex gap in Neuroticism was wider in regions with higher Health Index
scores and in regions where people endorsed survival-oriented values compared to regions with
of the regional indicators explained the within-country gender/sex differences across regions.

Age and education were controlled for in the Model 3 analyses in all samples, except for the
German SOEP 2012–2013 sample, where education failed to reach statistical significance (p >
.05). None of the regional indicators showed a significant interaction effect with gender/sex in
the German SOEP 2005, Russian CPS, and US SAPA 2015–2017 samples. However, in the US
SAPA 2014–2015 sample, significant interactions were found between gender/sex and several
regional indicators: SHDI (β = -1.62, SE = .66, p = .015), SHDI Health Index (β = -1.30, SE =
.50, p = .009), SHDI Income Index (β = -1.09, SE = .46, p = .019), individualism/collectivism (β
= -.004, SE = .001, p = .002), and survival/self-expression scores (β = -0.11, SE = .04, p = .007),
all contributing significantly to explaining the variance in the gender/sex gap in
Conscientiousness across regions. In the German SOEP 2009 sample, significant interactions
were found between gender/sex and the SHDI Health Index (β = -3.04, SE = 1.25, p =.015) and
the FemAI (β = -.02, SE = .01, p = .013). Additionally, the interaction between gender/sex and
the SHDI Educational Index was a significant predictor of Conscientiousness scores in two
SOEP 2017 (β = 1.91, SE = .74, p = .010).

Discussion
In this study, we investigated whether the well-established gender/sex equality paradox in
FFM personality traits (Balducci, 2023; Ilmarinen & Lönnqvist, 2024)—which refers to the
counterintuitive finding that as societies become more developed and gender-equal, differences
in personality traits between men and women tend to increase rather than decrease—could also
be observed within large countries with socially and economically diverse regions.
Using multiple large-scale datasets from Germany, Russia, and the United States, which
included data on FFM personality traits collected with various instruments using both self- and
informant-ratings, we tested associations between gender/sex differences in FFM personality
traits and regional-level variance in human development, gender egalitarianism,
individualism/collectivism, and survival/self-expression values. While previous research has
documented regional differences in FFM personality traits and the aforementioned social and
value indicators (Allik et al., 2009; Ebert et al., 2022; Elleman et al., 2018; GIWPS, 2020; Götz
et al., 2020; Minkov et al., 2023; Norlén et al., 2019; Obschonka et al., 2013; Obschonka et al.,
2019; Rentfrow et al., 2013; Smits & Permanyer, 2019; Vandello & Cohen, 1999) in these
countries, less is known about regional gender/sex differences in personality traits.
If cultural variation in the size of gender/sex gap in FFM personality traits results from the
interplay of innate sex differences and levels of societal development—whether economic,
human, or social—along with its underlying values, as suggested by the emergently moderated
perspective of gender/sex differences (Schmitt, 2015), then country-level findings should
replicate at the regional level within countries under examination. Therefore, using within-
country data, which is less confounded by language or cultural biases compared to cross-cultural
data, would further test the gender equality paradox and shed light on its origins.

Regional Differences in FFM Personality Traits within Three Countries
Previous research has shown significant intra-cultural variance in personality traits
(Stackhouse et al., 2024; Steel & Taras, 2010; Taras et al., 2016). It appears to be a general rule
that mean differences in personality traits across countries are approximately 8.5 times smaller
than the differences between any two randomly selected individuals from these samples (Allik et
al., 2017). Therefore, we anticipated that regional differences within countries will be either the
same or even greater in magnitude compared to the average differences between individuals.
Our findings highlight the importance of distinguishing between the FFM personality traits
when assessing regional differences. A consistent result across the seven samples from three
countries was that for Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness, within-region variation in
personality traits was greater than between-region variance. Each of the five traits showed a
unique pattern in a study within Germany and the United States using spatial level analysis
(Ebert et al., 2022); however, this study showed only between-regional variation in two out of
the five personality traits. In Russia, the mean profiles within 39 samples was similar across
regions (Allik et al., 2009), which partially supports the results of this study. However, the
findings of this study do not imply that there are no regional differences in these traits; it is
possible that they are smaller than the statistical power of the methods used allowed us to detect.
Significant regional differences in Conscientiousness and Openness scores were observed
across all countries and samples, different questionnaires and rating types (self-reports vs.
informant ratings) except for Openness scores in the Germany SOEP 2012–2013 sample. This
mirrored cross-cultural research. Previous studies showed that Conscientiousness,
Agreeableness, and Openness showed highest differences across nations. Meanwhile,
Agreeableness and Openness varied the most across world-regions (Schmitt et al., 2007). Several
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 50
factors may explain the within-country regional differences in these two traits. One possibility is
the selective migration of individuals with similar traits (Rentfrow, 2020). For example,
Openness tends to be higher among those who choose to move, both within and between
countries (Camperio Ciani et al., 2007; Jokela, 2009; Jokela et al., 2008; Silventoinen et al.,
2008). Ecological influences may also play a role (Götz et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2022) as
individuals living in urban areas consistently exhibit higher levels of Openness and lower levels
of Conscientiousness compared to those in rural areas (Militaru et al., 2024). Conversely,
Conscientiousness scores are strongly associated with regional socio-political and health
indicators (Rentfrow et al., 2015).
The Gender Equality Paradox at the Within-country Regional Level
Returning to the main aim of the study, all samples exhibiting significant regional variation
in Openness and Conscientiousness scores also showed significant regional gender/sex
differences in these traits, which remained significant after controlling for individuals’ age and
education level. Previous findings showed that gender/sex differences were larger in Neuroticism
and Agreeableness compared to the other three traits (Kajonius & Johnson, 2018; Murphy et al.,
2021; Schmitt et al., 2008). Hence, the results of this study on gender/sex gap variation across
regions might be limited to Openness and Conscientiousness due to the inability to detect
regional variance on scores on Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness. It is important to
note that regional variation in gender/sex differences in Openness and Conscientiousness, while
significant, did not exceed 2.5%. However, the regional indicators tested—namely, SHDI and its
subcomponent scores, gender egalitarianism, individualism/collectivism, and survival/self-
expression values—did not consistently account for regional gender/sex differences in Openness
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 51
and Conscientiousness scores across all samples and countries. Consequently, none of our
hypotheses regarding the gender equality paradox were fully supported by the data.
Our analysis did confirm that regional gender/sex differences in Openness and
Conscientiousness were explained by regional educational attainment, as measured by the SHDI
Education index, in four out of seven samples. This finding supports the gender equality paradox
observed at the cultural level. In some samples, higher regional scores on the SHDI Health index
and the survival/self-expression value dimension were also significantly correlated with smaller
gender/sex differences in the personality traits of Openness and Conscientiousness. However, as
mentioned earlier, these findings were not consistent across all samples and countries, suggesting
that they may be specific to certain countries, personality inventories, or rating types.
In the context of relevant theory, social role theory states that gender roles drive gender/sex
differences in psychological variables such as traits and values (Wood & Eagly, 2012).
According to this theory, one would expect to find region-level associations between higher
levels of gender equality and a smaller gender/sex gap in personality traits in data from Germany
and the US (Schmitt et al., 2017). However, our findings indicated that none of the gender
equality measures were significantly related to regional gender/sex differences in Openness and
Conscientiousness scores, contradicting previous findings consistently observed at the cultural
level (Lippa, 2010; Weisberg et al., 2011). Even though both US and German states exhibit
significant levels of judicial independence—variations in women’s rights, including abortion
rights for instance, can differ greatly between states (GIWPS, 2020; Norlén et al., 2019)—it may
be that the variation in regional gender equality is still not sufficient to capture differences in the
size of the gender/sex gap in personality traits across regions. Future research should also
investigate whether variations in gender equality in different regions of Russia—data we could
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 52
not obtain for the present study—are associated with widening regional gender/sex differences in
Openness and Conscientiousness.
Our results offer some cautious support to the emergently-moderated perspective of
gender/sex differences, which suggests that while personality traits are genetically predisposed,
they are also influenced by environmental and ecological factors (Schmitt et al., 2017). We
found that widening gender/sex gaps in Openness and Conscientiousness were associated with
higher levels of educational attainment in regions of Germany, Russia, and the United States.
Although this result was not consistently observed across all tested samples, its prevalence across
countries is noteworthy. It seems that gender/sex differences in Openness and Conscientiousness
scores are more pronounced in regions with better education systems, schools, or educational
policies. At the individual level, previous research evidence suggests that women score higher
than men on Conscientiousness personality trait and this difference is linked to the gender/sex
gap in academic achievement (Spielmann et al., 2022; Verbree et al., 2023). While Openness
explained less variance than Conscientiousness, it too was associated with academic performance
(Mammadov, 2022). This pattern may extend to the regional level, where regions exhibiting
larger gender/sex gaps in Openness and Conscientiousness also have higher levels of educational
attainment.
Strengths and Limitations of the Study
Our study has several strengths and limitations. One strength is the testing of hypotheses
across multiple countries, samples and time periods, which enhances the generalizability of the
results. Another strength is the intra-cultural comparison, which controls for potential cultural
and gender/sex response biases, as all participants in a country completed the personality
questionnaires in the same language. Additionally, the use of various FFM personality
THE GENDER EQUALITY PARADOX WITHIN COUNTRIES 53
questionnaires and rating types (self- and informant-ratings) addresses method bias and ensures
that the findings are generalizable across different measurement tools and rating types.
A limitation of our study is that within-country regional indicators showed less variation
compared to cross-country differences. One possible reason for this is that the data collected
from regions in Russia and the United States were neither based on representative samples nor
covered all main regions in those two countries. Future replication efforts should aim to use more
representative samples with broader regional coverage. Another limitation was the unequal and
non-comparable sample sizes, which may have hindered the detection of gender/sex differences
across regions. Although these limitations did not apply to the German data, there were still
notable inconsistencies across the findings from different GSOEP samples collected at various
time points. Future replications should also be conducted in non-WEIRD countries that have
sufficient within-country regional variation in personality traits and relevant social and cultural
indicators.
Conclusion
The results of our study offer some support for a within-country gender-equality paradox
concerning two FFM traits, Openness and Conscientiousness, with higher regional educational
attainment linked to widening gender/sex gaps in these traits across samples from Germany,
Russia, and the United States. Future research should further explore this topic, potentially
incorporating both individual and regional-level data when testing country differences within the
same multilevel analysis to advance our understanding of the gender-equality paradox.
