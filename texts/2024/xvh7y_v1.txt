Abstract
In order to assess an assessment, one must consider whether the assessment produces valid and
reliable results according to its intended goals. Given the various ways that validity and
reliability can be assessed based on the goals of some assignment, there is no singular
methodology for analyzing an educational assessment. This study attempts to address this
research gap by presenting a unifying methodology that incorporates both CTT and IRT, along
with other measures of validity and reliability, that can provide a robust analysis of an
educational assessment while considering the goals of that assessment. Utilizing item measures
from Classic Test Theory, Item Response Theory, and Distractor Analysis, we present a summary
of each metric that will inform labeling items as sufficiently discriminating for the purposes of an
educational assessment. We then present an analysis of 4 exams to illustrate how the metrics can
be used in concert to identify validity and reliability at the item and assessment level. We
conclude with a brief discussion of how this methodology can be applied to different types of
assessments.

Introduction
Assessment is an integral part of every course. While all assessments attempt to measure student
knowledge, the inherent goals of each assignment drives the design. When one hears the word
“assessment” they often consider high-stakes exams that attempt to evaluate student knowledge
against some predefined metrics. Final exams, placement exams, and general standardized tests
like ACT and SAT all fit this category, and fall under evaluative assessments. In contrast,
formative assessments attempt to measure student knowledge to further enhance the student’s
learning. This can be further split by the goal of the formative assessment: assessment as learning
(AaL) and assessment of learning (AoL). In AaL, the process of completing the assessment acts
as the learning opportunity. Homework and group work normally serve the goals of AaL. In AfL,
the instructor uses evidence collected during assessments to guide further instruction. In AoL,
the assessment attempts to identify whether learning has occurred and if interventions need to be
implemented. Quick surveys (such as through clicker questions) or quizzes normally serve the
goals of AoL (Dann, 2014).
In order to assess an assessment, one must consider whether the assessment produces valid and
reliable results according to its intended goals. Within assessment, validity refers to the extent a
test measures what it purports to measure and reliability refers to the extent results can be
replicated (Wu et al., 2016). For example, the goal of a placement exam is to classify students
into the highest course they could take with success. Measuring the validity of a placement test
would include analyzing the course grades for students placed and determining the impact of the
placement test. Measuring the reliability of a placement test would include checking that students
are consistently classified into some course. In contrast, the goal of a standardized test like the
SAT is to measure some academic ability and report it in an ordered form to distinguish between
high-performing and low-performing students. Measuring the validity of a standardized test may
include checking the validity of individual questions (to ensure answering the question correctly
relates to the student having some knowledge) while measuring reliability may include
comparing correct response rates across versions within the same year and between different
years.
Given the various ways that validity and reliability can be assessed based on the goals of some
assignment, there is no singular methodology for analyzing an educational assessment. In
general, there are two broad frameworks for studying assessments: Classical Test Theory (CTT)
and Item Response Theory (IRT). CTT presents an analysis of the results of an assessment
focusing on the overall scores on the assessment, whereas IRT presents an analysis that relates a
latent, or unobservable, state (such as student ability) to an observed outcome (such as an answer
choice on an assessment item). The latent variable is estimated by a series of observed outcomes
as well as the relation of these outcomes to others’ outcomes (estimated item difficulties).
These frameworks need not be disparate, and can in fact inform each other. As Wu et al. state in
Educational Measurement for Applied Researchers:
…while there are theoretical differences between IRT and CTT…, in practice, both IRT
and CTT help us with building a good measuring instrument. Consequently, CTT and IRT
should be used hand-in-hand in a complementary way, and one should not discard one
approach for another (p.26).
This study attempts to address this research gap by presenting a unifying methodology that
incorporates both CTT and IRT, along with other measures of validity and reliability, that can
provide a robust analysis of an educational assessment while considering the goals of that
assessment.
The outline of this paper is as follows: in the Theoretical Framework section, we present
measures associated with CTT, IRT, and other measures for validity and reliability that will make
up our unifying methodology for assessing educational assessments; in the Methods section, we
frame the context with which we test and attempt to validate the theoretical framework; in the
Results section, we present the findings of each measure outlined in the theoretical framework;
in the Discussion sections, we relate the findings of the results for each measurement to present a
unified analysis of the discriminatory power of items in the exams studied; finally, in the
Conclusions we present some ideas for utilizing this methodology and directions for future study.
Theoretical Framework
Assessment theory commonly starts with the assumption that an assessment will have options
(multiple-choice) or be measured as correct/incorrect (free response). In educational assessment,
multiple-choice options are constructed using plausible but incorrect options known as
distractors. While some IRT models can accommodate distractors (such as providing partial
credit for the selection of certain distractors seen as “close” to the correct answer), distractor
analysis is commonly completed in an ad hoc manner. However, evaluating distractors is critical
when the goal of an assessment is to enhance student learning and not to simply discriminate
between high-performing and low-performing students. Therefore, our unifying methodology
incorporates CTT, IRT, and distractor analysis in a coherent fashion to triangulate assessment
validity and reliability.
Classical Test Theory
Classical Test Theory is the analysis of assessments based primarily on students’ overall
(observed) assessment scores. In general, the core assumption underlying CTT is that a student’s
observed score is the sum of their “true score,” which measures their actual understanding of an
underlying concept, and an “error score,” which can result from numerous sources. The true
score is defined as the expectation of the observed score, meaning that “on average” the error
will cancel out of the equation. There are a few key statistics that can be measured when
studying assessments using this framework: observed score and the statistical measures therein,
reliability, item difficulty, and point-biserial correlation (a measure of item discrimination). A
brief description for each of these key statistics follows.
Observed score distribution
One common assumption in classic psychometric is the assumption of normality in assessment
results. However, educational assessments do not frequently present normal results (Ho & Yu,
2015). Thus, when presenting results on educational assessments, it is important to highlight
statistics that measure the normality of data such as skew and kurtosis. Skew, an estimate of the
third standardized moment of the distribution, describes where the “hump” of the data is in
relation to the center (either mean or median) while kurtosis1, an estimate of the fourth
standardized moment of the distribution, describes the shape of the “tails” of the data. A normal
distribution has a skew of 0 and kurtosis of 0. Early authors in non-normal assessment analysis
such as Lord (1955) report that “easy” tests commonly present negative skew and that
symmetric test distributions present negative kurtosis.
1 It is common to present kurtosis as (kurtosis - 3), which is referred to as excess kurtosis as kurtosis of a normal
distribution is 3.
Item difficulty
For dichotomous items (correct/incorrect), item difficulty refers to the proportion of students that
answered an item correctly. For polytomous items, responses may be weighted for partial credit.
For the purposes of this paper, we only consider dichotomous item difficulty. Item difficulty
represents the mean score on an item. Its role in discrimination is more of an indicator that an
item will not be able to be used to discriminate between high and low performing students than
as an indicator of performance. An item with too high of a difficulty was answered correctly by
nearly all of the students, and can thus not be used to discriminate against high performing
students. The same applies for low item difficulty and low performing students. In light of this,
Lord (1955) suggests ideal item difficulties as slightly higher than halfway between a random
guess and 100%, with 74% and 70% for four and five option multiple choice assessment items
respectively (p.189).
Point-biserial correlation
Point-biserial correlation (PBC) is an item-level statistic that measures the correlation between
students’ performance on a question and their performance on the exam as a whole. In other
words, PBC describes how well the item discriminated between high-performing and
low-performing students and is entirely distinct from item difficulty. PBC is equivalent to the
Pearson correlation coefficient relating these two quantities, so the traditional interpretation of
correlation coefficients can be applied: values range from -1 to 1; positive values indicate a
positive correlation between the two quantities (that is, students that perform well on the exam as
a whole perform well on the item), negative values indicate a negative correlation between the
two quantities (students that perform well on the exam as a whole perform poorly on the item or
students who perform poorly on the exam as a whole perform well on the item), and values close
to zero indicate that a given question is not predictive of performance on the exam at all (and
vice versa).
PBC can be computed using the following formula:
∑ (𝑥 − 𝑥)(𝑦 − 𝑦)
𝑖 𝑖
𝑖=1
𝑟 =
(1)
𝑥𝑦
𝑛 𝑛
2 2
( ) ( )
∑ 𝑥 − 𝑥 ∑ 𝑦 − 𝑦
𝑖 𝑖
𝑖=1 𝑖=1
Where 𝑛 is the number of students that completed the question being assessed, 𝑥 is the 𝑖-th
student’s score on the question being assessed (𝑥 = 0 indicates a wrong answer, 𝑥 = 1
𝑖 𝑖
indicates a correct answer), 𝑥 is the mean score on the question being assessed. 𝑦 is the 𝑖-th
student’s score on the other questions on the exam, 𝑦 is the mean score on the other questions on
the exam.
Items with negative PBC or a PBC of zero are poor assessment items as they indicate that the
item is answered incorrectly by students that perform well on the exam (suggests an item has an
error) or that the item bears no relationship to student performance and can be removed without
consequence. Categorization of PBCs for educational assessment purposes are not uniform as
assessments primarily serve to assess the curriculum rather than as collections of items with the
most predictive power (Wu et al., 2016). To motivate our categorizations of PBCs, we consider
two thresholds based on the number of questions in the assessment (𝐾) and number of students
who answered questions in the assessment (𝑛).
Our first threshold is based on the assumption of perfect determination. Given an exam with 𝐾
questions, the coefficient of determination for a single question is 𝑟 = and thus the
correlation of any one question to the overall score would be 𝑟 = . Questions with
correlations at or above suggest a reasonable explanation of the overall score based on the
assessment size. For example, in an exam with 10 questions, a reasonable correlation would be
0.32 versus 0.22 in an exam with 20 questions.
Our second threshold is based on Fisher’s z-transformation, which converts a correlation
coefficient r into a normally distributed variable z. The standard error for Fisher’s z is
𝑆𝐸 = . By converting the correlations to a normally distributed variable, one can calculate
𝑛−3
a confidence interval with the formula 𝑧' ± 𝑧 * 𝑆𝐸 . For significance 0.046, 𝑧 = 2. Thus
𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡 𝑧 𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡
when 𝑧' = 𝑆𝐸 , we have a confidence interval centered at 0. This suggests a reasonable poor
( )
1 1
item threshold to be tanh ≈ when 𝑛 > 21. As we convert to a normally
𝑛−3 𝑛−3
distributed variable z, we suggest a sample size 𝑛 of at least 30.
We thus categorize items using number of questions (𝐾) and assessment sample size (𝑛) in the
following way:
● Poor: 𝑃𝐵𝐶≤ These items at best have a confidence interval centered at 0 and thus
𝑛−3
do not have adequate predictive power for overall assessment score.
1 1
● Acceptable: < 𝑃𝐵𝐶 < These items have acceptable predictive power but may
𝑛−3 𝐾
be improved with revision.
● Good: 𝑃𝐵𝐶≥ These items are at least as predictive as under an “ideal” assessment
where each question is independent and explains variance of student responses.
We note these categories align with common thresholds provided in the literature. For example,
Varma (2006) notes “A point-biserial value of at least 0.15 is recommended, though our
experience has shown that “good” items have point-biserials above 0.2 (p. 6)” which aligns with
𝑛 = 45 for the minimum recommended PBC and 𝐾 = 24 for the minimum good PBC. These
thresholds also assume that 𝐾 < 𝑛 − 3, which may not hold for assessments administered in
small classes2. Considerations for thresholds where 𝐾 ≥ 𝑛 − 3 will be evaluated in future
studies.
Reliability
Assessment reliability refers to the correlation between a student’s performance on a given
assessment and their performance on a parallel assessment. In other words, how well does a
student’s performance on a given exam match their performance on a nearly identical exam, such
as different versions of the same exam. The most straightforward way to compute this statistic
would be to compute the correlation between a student’s scores on two exam versions taken in a
short time period from one another. This measure is impractical to compute in a typical learning
environment. A practical measure is the Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20) reliability
coefficient (Salvucci et al., 1997). The KR-20 coefficient given by Equation 2 measures the
correlation between the variance in student scores on a given exam to the proportion of students
that got each question correct.
𝐾 𝑛

( ) 𝑥 𝑖 𝑖 2 𝑗
𝐾−1
⎛ 𝑖=1 ⎞ 𝑗=1
𝑟 = , σ = (2)
𝐾 2 𝑥 𝑛−1
⎝ ⎠
Where 𝐾 is the number of questions on the exam being assessed, 𝑝 is the proportion of correct
answers on the 𝑖-th question, 𝑛 is the number of students that completed the exam being
assessed, 𝑥 is the 𝑗-th student’s score on the exam in question, 𝑥 is the mean score on the exam
being assessed.
(Salvucci et al., 1997) suggested the following criteria:
● Low reliability: 𝑟 < 0. 5.
● Moderate reliability: 0. 5 ≤ 𝑟 < 0. 8.
● High reliability: 0. 8 ≤ 𝑟. (p. 115).
Item Response Theory
In contrast to Classical Test Theory, Item Response Theory (IRT) methodologies seek to learn a
student’s latent (unobservable) ability variable by analyzing the students’ responses to each given
item in the context of all students’ responses to each given item. In general, this approach works
by developing a mathematical model that relates a given item’s estimated difficulty (based on all
students’ responses) to the learned latent ability variable (based on the individual student’s
responses to all items). The developed model can then be used to predict the probability that a
given student (with corresponding latent ability) will correctly answer a given item (with
corresponding estimated difficulty). In this model, students with an equal or higher latent ability
than an item’s estimated difficulty are predicted to correctly answer the item.
2 A sample size of at least n = 30 is recommended for computing PBC. This will help maintain the assumptions with
regard to the normally distributed variable z used to derived the lower bound.
Rasch One-Parameter Model
In the dichotomous setting, one can construct a one-parameter Rasch model that predicts that a
student will answer an item correctly using the following probability distribution function:
𝑒𝑥𝑝 (θ−δ)
𝑝 = 𝑃(𝑋 = 1|θ, δ) = (3)
1+𝑒𝑥𝑝 (θ−δ)
Where 𝑋 is the binary random variable that is equal to 1 if a student answers a question correctly
and 0 if they answer it incorrectly, θ is the learned latent student ability variable, and δ is the
estimated difficulty of a given item. The one-parameter Rasch model assumes all items
discriminate equally and thus the discrimination parameter, which would multiply (θ − δ) in a
one-parameter model, is 1. Given θ and δ for a particular student and item, respectively,
Equation 3 returns the probability that the student in question answers the item correctly. Note
when student’s latent ability θ is equal to item difficulty δ, the probability of the student
answering the question correctly is 0.5.
When we fix some item difficulty, we can plot the sigmoid curve relating ability to probability of
ICCs for items of difficulties -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, and 1 to illustrate how items with lower item
difficulty reach higher correct probability more quickly. For example, a student with 0 estimated
ability would be expected to answer an item with -1 difficulty correctly about 73% of the time
while the same student would be expected to answer an item with 0.5 difficulty about 27% of the
time.
Estimated Item Difficulty and Latent Ability
Two immediate consequences of training a one parameter Rasch model are “learning” an
estimate for the item difficulty for each assessment item, and the latent ability for each student
that took the exam. This means, for each item and student, there is a corresponding probability
distribution function from which the probability that they will get an item correct. This
probability can be obtained by substituting the appropriate θ and δ into Equation 3.
Beyond the utility in computing the probability a given student will answer a question correctly
(which will provide the basis for analyses to come), these derived measures from training the
model can provide insight into the student population and the questions on the assessment. The
distribution of student abilities and item difficulties can help inform the assessor of the spread of
the students’ abilities and the items’ difficulty. It is important to note that the latent ability θ and
item difficulty δ are unitless, and do not represent the same type of numerical relationship that
PBC or item difficulty represent.
Infit and Outfit
After constructing a Rasch model of estimated student ability and item difficulty to predict the
probability of answering a question correctly, one can consider how well the model fits the data.
The Rasch model makes the assumption that all items have the same discrimination parameter
value 1. We can consider fit values of less than 1 as overfitting the data and fit values greater
than 1 as underfitting. We consider two residual-based fit statistics: outfit (outlier-sensitivity fit)
and infit (information-weighted fit).
Residual-Based Fit
Residuals, in the case of a Rasch model, refers to the difference in the model’s calculated
probability of a student, 𝑠, answering an item, 𝑖, correctly: 𝐸(𝑥 ) = 𝑃(𝑋 = 1|θ , δ ), and the
𝑠𝑖 𝑠 𝑖
student’s observed score, 𝑥 , on the same question. The residual-based fit is calculated as this
𝑠𝑖
difference divided by the variance of the item response.
𝑥 − 𝐸(𝑋 )
𝑠𝑖 𝑠𝑖
𝑧 = (4)
𝑠𝑖 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑋 )
𝑠𝑖
Residual-based fit statistics can be measured against the standardized error of items as defined by
1 over the sum by items of the fit variance.
𝑆𝐸 =
𝑖 (5)
∑𝑣
𝑠𝑖
Outliers occur beyond 1 ± 𝑆𝐸 . Since items with fit near 1 have the least discrimination power,
it is suggested to use items with fit less than 1. We can thus categorize fit statistics as follows:
● Poor: 𝑓𝑖𝑡 ≥ 1 + 𝑆𝐸
● Acceptable: 1 − 𝑆𝐸 < 𝑓𝑖𝑡 < 1 + 𝑆𝐸
𝑖 𝑖
● Good: 𝑓𝑖𝑡 ≤ 1 − 𝑆𝐸
Outfit (outlier-sensitivity fit)
The outfit, or unweighted mean fit, is the average of the standardized fits without accounting for
item variance.

Outfit identifies patterns when item difficulty is far from student ability. For example, outfit
might identify when students with high ability answer a low difficulty question incorrectly or
vice versa.
Infit (information-weighted fit)
The infit, or weighted mean fit, is the average of the standardized fits while accounting for item
variance.
∑𝑧 𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑋 )
𝑠𝑖 𝑠𝑖
𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑡 = (7)
∑𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑋 )
𝑠𝑖
Infit identifies patterns when item difficulty is close to student ability. For example, infit might
identify when students with ability near the item difficulty perform far better than expected by
the model.
Distractors
Plausible, but incorrect, answers to the problem are referred to as distractors. Distractors can
represent a wide variety of types of incorrect responses, and have been the topic of plenty of
literature (Chamberlain Jr. & Jeter, 2019, 2020; Gierl et al., 2015, 2017). They can represent
student misconceptions about the concept being assessed in a question or another concept; they
can represent issues in manipulation or representation; they can even be created by manipulating
the correct answer to the problem. Given the many types of thinking distractor answer choices
can represent, they potentially play an integral role in the discriminative power of a multiple
choice item. For example, an item that has no distractors that represent plausible misconceptions
could inadvertently direct students to the correct answer choice without any understanding of the
underlying concept being evaluated.
Distractors Chosen Percentage
In light of the significance of distractor answer choices, the frequency with which distractors are
chosen can be very telling. The percentage of chosen distractors measures the rate at which
students chose a distractor against the total number of distractors on the exam. We categorize
distractors into three categories based on how often they were selected: “never chosen” (chosen
0% of the time), “rarely chosen” (chosen between 0% and 5% of the time) and “sometimes
chosen” (chosen more than 5% of the time). These categories help to identify distractors that
were poor (never chosen), distractors that were either chosen at random or elicited a small
percentage of students (potentially effective distractors), and effective distractors. Distractors in
the latter two categories have potential to give insight into misconceptions present in student
thinking, while distractors in the first category should be discarded and replaced with distractors
based on theoretical or experimental design.
Effective Distractors
An effective distractor is an incorrect answer choice that is chosen by students at a rate of at least
5% (Hingorjo & Jaleel, 2012). A distractor choice being chosen with some level of frequency
indicates that it is likely to capture potential coherent thinking resulting from misconceptions
about content. Ideally, every distractor would be “effective,” (each question would have 3 or 4
effective distractors, depending on whether the question has 4 or 5 options) meaning that it is
chosen at least 5% of the time. Realistically, many factors contribute to the choice of a distractor
on an item, such as the exam it is seen on (e.g., first exam versus final exam) and the level of
students taking the exam. Moreover, the literature suggests that 3 choices (2 distractors and 1
correct solution), is optimal from a theoretical, empirical, and practical consideration (Haladyna
et al., 2019). In light of these potential issues, the number of effective distractors a question has
should hint to the discriminative power of the question itself.
Identifying Discriminative Items
Utilizing item measures from Classic Test Theory, Item Response Theory, and Distractor
Analysis, we present a summary of each metric that will inform labeling items as sufficiently
discriminating for the purposes of an educational assessment. Our methodology begins by
classifying each item-level metric into “ideal”, “acceptable”, or “poor” and analyzing how these
categories collectively explain the discriminative power of the item.
Item-Level Metrics
● Item Difficulty - Proportion of student sample who answered the item correctly. Ideally,
item difficulty is normally distributed about 0.74 with as small a variance as possible. We
consider items within one standard deviation of 0.74 to be “ideal” and items within two
standard deviations as “acceptable.” Items outside of this range are “poor.”
● Point-Biserial Correlation - Correlation between proportion of student sample who
answered the item correctly and student sample overall score on assessment. Ideally
correlation is at or above 1/ 𝐾 and is at least above 1/ 𝑛 − 3.
● Rasch Item Infit - Infit identifies patterns when estimated item difficulty is close to
estimated student ability. Ideally less than 1 - standard error, at least less than 1 +
standard error.
● Rasch Item Outfit - Outfit identifies patterns when estimated item difficulty is far from
estimated student ability. Ideally less than 1 - standard error, at least less than 1 +
standard error.
● Effective Distractors - Distractors chosen at least 5%. Ideally all non-answers are
effective Distractors, while at least one non-answer is an effective distractor.
We then classify each assessment-level metric into “ideal”, “acceptable”, or “poor” and analyze
how these categories collectively explain the reliability and discriminative power of the
assessment.
Assessment-Level Metrics
● Item Difficulty Distribution - Ideal average item difficulty is slightly higher than
halfway between random guess chance and 100% (e.g., 4-option item as ideally 0.74)
with minimal item difficulty variation.
● KR-20 Reliability Coefficient - Reliability between different forms of an assessment.
Ideally at or above 0.8, at least at or above 0.5.
● Distractors Chosen Distribution - Distribution of Distractors chosen across all items.
Ideally Distractors are chosen at least 5% of the time.
Methods
To present a working example of our methodology, we study four multiple-choice exams
administered in College Algebra over the course of the Fall 2017 term at the University of
summary of the assessments.

exam
To perform a thorough analysis of the exams, the exam items, and the students, we perform both
exam-level analyses using Classical Test Theory (CTT) and item-level analyses using Item
Response Theory (IRT).
Classical Test Theory
The CTT methods outlined in the methodology require extracting every student answer to each
exam item as well as the corresponding solution to each item. With this information, observed
scores for each student on each assessment can be computed by dividing the number of items
they answered correctly on an exam by the number of items on the exam. Similarly, item
difficulty is computed by dividing the number of correct responses to an item by the number of
students that attempted the item. With the observed score for each student and their responses to
each item, point-biserial correlation can then be computed by evaluating Equation 1 for each
item and computing the corresponding bounds based on the number of questions on an exam and
the number of students that took that exam. Lastly for CTT analyses, using the responses from
each item (and in turn the proportion of correct answers), KR-20 can be computed for each exam
directly from Equation 2.
Item Response Theory
We construct a one parameter Rasch model using the unconditional maximum likelihood
estimation (UCON) method. The steps for training the model are as follows:
1. Remove students with 100% scores and 0% scores
As we are computing the natural log of average scores (either by student or by item),
log(0) will produce errors.
2. Approximate ability and difficulty

Distractors
The distractor-based methods outlined in the Methodology only require compiling a list of all
student answers and a complete list of possible answer choices with their label of “distractor” or
“solution.” From these data, percentages of distractors chosen and effective distractors per item
only require direct computations of each distractor’s frequency of being chosen and then
counting the number of distractors per item that were chosen more than 5% of the time.
Item Discrimination
A summary dataset of all of the items can be constructed using the methods for generating item
level measurements outlined in the previous “Methods” subsections. With this summary dataset,
the “ideal/good,” “acceptable,” and poor thresholds can be directly computed, and each item
directly assessed for its quality with regard to each measure.
Results
Here we present an overview of each measurement described in the methodology with respect to
the exams outlined in the Methods section.
Classical Test Theory
Overall, the Classical Test Theory analysis paints a picture typical of multiple-choice
assessments in lower division Mathematics courses: there is a tendency for a large percentage of
the class to get nearly all the assessment items correct. Ultimately, this limits the amount of
discriminative power of assessment items to determine specific conceptual misunderstandings,
because the modal response to a given item is correct.
Observed score distribution
While both forms for exam 1 had observed scores that were roughly normally distributed about
70%, the remaining exams are more closely modeled by a beta distribution, given the significant
mass on the right-hand side of the distribution (all distributions having a fairly large negative
skewness). This is in contrast for the preferred observed score distributions described in the
Methodology. Ideally, observed scores should follow a normal distribution with a kurtosis (the
measure of the probability mass contained in the tails of the distribution) close to zero.
The tendency towards right-skewed distributions can limit the discriminating power of the
exams. An exam composed almost entirely of items that most of the students get correct will not
be able to adequately discriminate between students with and without conceptual understanding.
Alternatively, it suggests that questions can be dropped without affecting how well the exam can
discriminate between student understanding.
Reliability
We measure assessment reliability using the Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20) correlation
coefficient. It measures the correlation between the proportion of right and wrong answers
among all questions on an exam and provides a metric for assessing the internal consistency of
an exam of dichotomous questions.
As we detailed above, a KR-20 below 0.5 means an exam has low reliability, KR-20 between 0.5
and 0.8 means an exam has moderate reliability, and KR-20 > 0.8 has high reliability. The KR-20
Exam Exam 1 Exam 2 Exam 3 Exam 4
Form A B A B C A B C A B C
KR-20 0.68 0.71 0.78 0.71 0.74 0.78 0.75 0.53 0.77 0.77 0.70
Aside from Exam 3 Form C, all of the exams scored comfortably in the “moderate reliability”
range. This means that a student given a parallel, but non-identical exam should achieve a similar
observed score to the exam that they completed during the period of study.
Item difficulty
Item difficulty describes the proportion of students that answer a given dichotomous question
correctly. For dichotomous exams, it is ideal for item difficulty to be normally distributed with a
small variance, such that there is sufficient data to discriminate between high and low performing
students.
Similar to the observed score distributions, with the exception of exam 1, the distributions for
item difficulty are not normal, they are mostly right skewed. Combined with the observed scores
distributions, this indicates that not only do most students perform well on all of the exams, but
most of the items are answered correctly by most students.
Point-biserial correlation
Using the formula in Equation 2 and the thresholds for “poor,” (𝑃𝐵𝐶≤ ) “acceptable,” (
𝑛−3
1 1 1
< 𝑃𝐵𝐶 < ) and “good” (𝑃𝐵𝐶≥ ), we are able to classify the point-biserial
𝑛−3 𝐾 𝐾
correlation for each item on each exam. The number of questions in each category for each exam
point-biserial correlation. Percentages for bars of the same color add up to 100%.
No exam has more than a few “poor” items in terms of point-biserial correlation, in fact, most
questions on most exams fall into the “good” category. This indicates that for most questions,
students’ performance on that question is indicative of their overall performance on the exam.
This is consistent with the general tendency towards most students answering most questions
correctly.
Item Response Theory
Overall, IRT results suggest exams 1 and 2 provide few outliers and that all questions
discriminate student ability in some manner. However, exams 3 and 4 produced several outliers
in both low and high difficulty questions evident through the estimated item difficulty values
outside of -2 to 2 range, poor/good infit, and poor/good outfit. We present a more detailed look at
each exam and each metric below.
Estimated Item Difficulty and Latent Ability
Item difficulty for exams 1 and 2 follow a normal distribution with almost all items estimated
between -2 and 2. However, exams 3 and 4 present a small number of questions outside of the
range -2 to 2 which are likely to be outliers. Moverover, exam 4 in particular presents a
skew-right distribution of item difficulty with a peak around -1, suggesting this exam was easier
described in Equation 3.
Student estimated latent ability over all 4 exams appeared skew-left with a peak between 1 and 2.
Recall that estimated latent ability begins as the natural log of a ratio of each student’s exam
scores. The model then adds to student ability to better fit the sigmoid curve and distinguish
between student performance. The model also removes any student scores of 0 and 100, resulting
in the low number of highest estimated latent ability.
described in Equation 3.
Item Infit
Recall that Item Infit identifies patterns when item difficulty is close to student ability. Item Infit
all exam items. It is unlikely that infit alone will predict the discrimination of any item, though a
poor item infit may be particularly indicative of an item that needs to be considered for removal.
Item Outfit
Recall that outfit identifies patterns when item difficulty is far from student ability. Unlike Item
outfit (underfit outliers). As expected with the increased frequency of item difficulties outside of
-2 and 2 in exams 3 and 4, far more outfits of poor and good appeared in those exams.
To further investigate the differences between poor and good item outfit, we consider the
correlation between good/poor outfit and estimated item difficulty as well as good/poor outfit
both the normal and natural log correlation for each.
At a glance, both good and poor outfit are correlated with the items’ estimated difficulties. In
particular, good outfit occurred primarily in questions with difficulties between -2 and 1 while
poor outfit was distributed throughout item difficulty (between -2 and 4). In other words,
“easier” questions had the best fit with the model (smallest difference between expected
probability of success and actual success). On the other hand, good and poor outfit do not appear
correlated with point-biserial correlation. This suggests outfit and point-biserial correlation can
be used in tandem to further distinguish between good and poor items on an assessment.

Distractors
Presenting answer choices that effectively capture students’ misconceptions of the content
mastery being evaluated can markedly improve the diagnostic utility of summative assessments.
In turn, this targeted distractor creation methodology can improve the discriminative power of
assessment items by providing an appropriate answer choice for students with specific
misconceptions (leading them to select the distractor answer choice instead of potentially
selecting at random). Similarly, poorly constructed distractor choices can increase the probability
of selecting the correct answer choice for savvy students by allowing them to eliminate answer
choices without any content mastery.
The results from analyzing the distractors in our study point to many distractors across the item
set being selected less than 5% of the time. Subsequently, the percent of items with more than
one effective distractor (a distractor chosen more than 5% of the time) is around 50% for most of
the exams. This implies that on most of the items, students are able to effectively reduce the
number of likely answer choices to 2 (the solution and the effective distractor). This increase in
probability of answering an item correctly at random (from 25% to 50% for most questions)
dramatically limits the discriminative power of these items.
Distractors Chosen Percentage
Analyzing the frequency with which a distractor answer choice is chosen, the “distractors chosen
percentage”, allows one to gain insight into how well the question design overall is able to
capture misconceptions into student thinking. Distractor answer choices can be split into three
major categories depending on the frequency with which they are chosen: chosen 0% of the time
(“never chosen”), chosen 0–5% of the time (“rarely chosen”), and chosen > 5% of the time
(“sometimes chosen”).
0% of the time), “Rarely Chosen” (chosen between 0% and 5% of the time), “Sometimes Chosen” (chosen more than 5% of the
time). Percents in each color of blocks sum to 100%.
noteworthy that each exam has between 37% and 62% of distractors chosen more than 5% of the
time. This indicates that largely distractor answer choices are scarcely selected. This mirrors the
findings related to observed scores: most students selected the correct answer on most items most
of the time.
Effective Distractors
With the cutoff of being selected at least 5% of the time for a distractor to be considered
for each exam. Most exams have ≈ 50% of questions with one or fewer effective distractors.
This means that there are a significant number of questions (though not all of the 50%) that a
student was able to improve their probability of randomly selecting the correct answer to at least
50%.
sum to 100%.
Identifying Discriminative Items
Combining all of the measurements for assessing assessment items with their corresponding
12. Each item in exam 4B is displayed with the six key measurements for identifying the
discriminative power displayed on the x axis: estimated item difficulty, outfit, infit, number of
effective distractors, point-biserial correlation, and item difficulty. The cells for each item are
color coded depending on whether the measurement falls into the “ideal/good,” (green)
“acceptable,” (yellow) or “poor” (red) category.
isolation. Item 4B26 has an estimated item difficulty of 4.28, which should be highly
discriminative, but the PBC of -0.11 and item difficulty of 0.09 suggest that this item was so hard
that almost no students were able to answer it correctly. While this item may be able to identify
the top student in a class, it is not generally effective at discriminating between high and low
performing students because it is so hard.
Items 4B09 and 4B10 are illustrative examples for the efficacy of the integrated methodology.
According to Rasch estimated item difficulty, infit, and outfit, both 4B09 and 4B10 are good
candidates for discriminative items. However, combined with effective distractors, PBC, and
item difficulty, it is clear that only 4B10 is an effective item. 4B09 has no effective distractors,
and is too easy to be discriminative (96% of students answered it correctly).
Lastly, the methodology can quite effectively identify ineffective items. 4B19 falls into the
“poor” category for every metric considered except for effective distractors and item difficulty
(both are acceptable).
Methodology section, yellow items achieve the “acceptable” thresholds, and red items are “poor.”
Discussions
are in isolation, but how effective they can be when combined. The thresholds provided with the
integrated methodology provide a direct comparison strategy that allows an instructor evaluating
the items in an assessment convenient bounds for judging the discriminative power of each item
across a range of measurements. When the measurements are in agreement, this provides the
instructor confidence in the discriminative power of an item and will help them decide whether
or not to maintain that item for future assessments. Moreover, the inclusion of distractor metrics
furthers the educational purposes of assessments by identifying patterns of student thinking
rather than solely predicting final score on assessment. It also provides nuance to considerations
for the optimal number of options on an item. Rather than arguing from a theoretical perspective
that 3 options provide the best statistical predictiveness, the number of item options may increase
if more than 2 effective distractors can be established on an item.
Returning to the goals of different types of assessments, these metrics may be used to further
specific goals of an assessment. For example, summative assessments will pay closer attention to
item difficulty and PBC as the goal of the assessment is to provide a single “descriptive” score
associated with the student’s ability. Alternatively, formative assessments like assessments as
learning (AaL) will pay closer attention to effective distractors (especially to present feedback
associated to established patterns of student thinking) and outfit outliers as both can identify
patterns of students answering incorrectly in expected ways (distractors) and unexpected ways
(outfit outliers).
Conclusions
In this study we presented an integrated methodology that combines ideas from classical test
theory, item response theory, and distractor analysis to identify discriminative items in multiple
choice mathematics assessments. We provided explicit, statistically motivated thresholds for
each measurement so that each item could be procedurally categorized as “ideal/good,”
“acceptable,” and “poor” with respect to each measurement. This methodology provides
instructors and researchers a high level view of each item in an assessment that can be easily
interpreted to see the relationships between each measurement and suggest items that are
effective and ineffective at discriminating between high and low performing students. This
allows the instructor to quickly evaluate items for retention and removal for future exams.
Beyond the value to an instructor deciding which items are effective and should be retained, the
items highlighted by this integrated methodology present the opportunity to determine why
certain items are more effective than others, and should be qualitatively analyzed by researchers.
Qualitative analysis of distractors identified using this integrated methodology remains to be
studied and will be the subject of future work.
