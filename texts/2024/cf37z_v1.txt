Abstract
This pre-registered meta-analysis examines the discriminant validity of Disintegration (D),
the trait-like conceptualization of psychotic-like experiences and behaviors (PLEBs), in
relation to the HEXACO personality traits. The main finding is that D shows small to
moderate intercorrelations (i.e., range = |.01| - |.31|) ranging within the HEXACO
intercorrelations. The main implication is that D as a most recent operationalization of PLEBs
is not covered by existing taxonomies, but rather suggests its addition, which may allow for
improved predictions of personality outcomes by covering previously neglected variance, or
by capturing new phenomena. Limitations of the primary studies aggregated and the extended
HEXACO plus D model are discussed.

Introduction
For several decades, various scholars have proposed the idea of conceptualizing the
dispositional proneness to psychotic-like experiences and behaviors (PLEBs) – otherwise
known as Psychoticism (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1976), Psychosis-Proneness (e.g., Chapman et
al., 1994), Oddity (Watson et al., 2008), Dissociation (Ashton & Lee, 2012; Momirović et al.,
1993), or Schizotypy (Claridge, 1997; Meehl, 1962, 1990) - as a trait-like dimension of
interindividual differences. Since then, there has been an ongoing debate about the
relationship of PLEBs with existing personality frameworks such as the Big Five (Goldberg,
1990) or HEXACO (Ashton & Lee, 2007; e.g., Ashton & Lee, 2012, 2019; DeYoung et al.,
2012; Knežević et al., 2017; Krueger et al., 2012; Watson et al., 2008). Roughly, three
positions have been proposed:
First, some researchers do not place PLEBs on a shared continuum with established
traits but rather place PLEBs entirely in the space of maladaptive personality (e.g., Krueger et
al., 2012). This separation of PLEBs from the space of normal personality is reflected in
Ashton and Lee's (2019) recommendation that a more comprehensive assessment of
personality should add proneness to PLEBs (such as Psychoticism) if one wish to account not
only for normal variations but also for the maladaptive ones.
Second, based on the finding that four of the five dimensions of the models of
maladaptive personality traits (such as DSM-5 Alternative Model of Personality Disorders,
AMPD) (Krueger & Markon, 2014; Widiger & Simonsen, 2005) correspond to the Big Five
dimensions, some researchers propose that PLEBs should be located within the dimension of
Openness, as its extreme maladaptive pole (e.g., Chmielewski et al., 2014; DeYoung et al.,
2012; ). Thus, this position negates the need for a dimension beyond existing personality
frameworks to explain PLEBs.

Third, based on the persuasive findings that the great majority of psychological
differences between people are latently continuous including psychopathology/ psychotic
disorders (e.g., Haslam et al., 2020), PLEBs are conceptualized as a manifestation of an
additional dimension of both normal and maladaptive variations, reconceptualized as a
hierarchical basic personality trait termed Disintegration (D). It was found to consist of nine
consistency, we will use D from now on. Like the adaptive function of other traits, higher
levels of D may be beneficial in ambiguous situations where false positives are less costly
when a person is occasionally right. Perceiving moving grass as a predator has a high survival
benefit in the rare case that it is indeed a predator that would otherwise have eaten one.

The empirical evidence justifying the trait-like character of D, separate from any other
established personality traits, appears contradictory. On the one hand, there is accumulating
evidence that D exhibits many of the characteristics of lexically derived traits. First, there is
support for the dimensionality of D (e.g., Kwapil & Barrantes-Vidal, 2014). Accordingly, D
ranges from non-pathological psychotic-like experiences to clinically relevant psychosis.
Similarly, D is normally distributed in the general population (Barret & Etheridge, 1992;
Hanssen et al., 2006; Johns & van Os, 2001). Thus, D is more common than might be
expected and, more importantly, is not restricted to the domain of psychopathology.
Furthermore, replicability is supported by evidence of both temporal stability (Sanislow et al.,
2009) and cross-cultural stability (Fonseca-Pedrero et al., 2018; Knežević et al., 2022a).
Similarly, D incrementally predicts phenomena such as (non-)psychopathology (Rössler et
al., 2011), socio-political attitudes and thinking styles (Knežević & Keller, 2023), and health-
related behaviors (Lazarević et al., 2021).
On the other hand, D has not been found in previous lexical studies (e.g., Ashton et al.,
2004; Lee & Ashton, 2008). Apparently, only the Big Five or HEXACO have been
repeatedly extracted and replicated across cultures and languages (McCrae et al., 2005;
Schmitt et al., 2007; Thielman et al., 2020). The non-appearance of D as a separate factor in
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 7
many lexical studies might be the result of decisions made by researchers in terms of the
valence of the adjectives deemed eligible for further analysis. Specifically, most lexical
studies favor descriptive adjectives as personality indicators and do largely neglect adjectives
which may have an evaluative (i.e., negatively valenced) connotation (Ashton & Lee, 2005).
When other potential personality indicators, such as negatively valenced adjectives and type
nouns, are selected, seven or more personality factors that partially correspond to the existing
traits can be extracted (Saucier, 2003; Vader & Saucier, 2024). Among these additional
factors are elements of D. Similarly, Saucier (2019) shows that morality-related terms were
unsystematically labeled as evaluative or neutral in the original personality indicator sets
(e.g., Goldberg, 1990, 1992), thus artificially inhibiting the extraction of an Honesty-
Humility (H) factor. Accordingly, understanding D as a purely pathological phenomenon
leads to classifying D-related terms such as “weird," "paranoid," or "crazy" as evaluative,
leading to their rejection. Thus, D could not be found because all terms describing it were
excluded a priori. Other researchers have argued that D-related terms may be too complex to
be encoded in a single term (Watson et al., 2008), or that terms describing D are phenomena
that have only recently become a focus of public awareness to be sufficiently encoded in
natural language (Knežević et al., 2016). The latter argument is based on the observation that
the emergence of traits follows socio-cultural developments (Piedmont & Aycock, 2007).
Related to novelty is the proposition that laypersons rarely encounter or experience D-like
phenomena, leading to less frequent linguistic representation and non-emergence when
frequency of use criteria are applied (Ashton & Lee, 2005, 2019).
What is Known About the Relationship of D With Established Personality Models?
In joint factor analytic studies, D was neither absorbed by the Big Five (Knežević et al.,
2017; Watson et al., 2008) or the HEXACO (Ashton & Lee, 2012, 2019; Knežević et al.,
2022a, Međedović, 2014). Moreover, the distinctiveness of D is robust to the level of analysis
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 8
(i.e., D is extracted with both items or facets; Knežević et al., 2017, 2022a) and the
assessment method (found in both self-report and close others' ratings) (Knežević et al.,
2017). It is also worth highlighting that a distinct D factor can be observed even in measures
that were not designed to capture D, i.e., it is seemingly found independent of the specific
operationalization (e.g., Ashton & Lee, 2019; Knežević et al., 2016). This is further supported
by meta-analytic evidence showing that D cannot - due to low intercorrelations - be
integrated into existing personality frameworks such as Eysenck's PEN model (Knežević et
al., 2019), Cloninger's Psychobiological Model of Personality (Lazarević et al., 2016), or the
Big Five (Knežević et al., 2016; Lindenmayer et al., 2004; Watson et al., 2008). Thus, the
empirical evidence to this date supports the notion that D is a unique dimension, distinct from
other established personality traits. However, whether these previous findings extend to the
HEXACO model across studies remains to be investigated, as the latter lack sufficient power
and generalizability. Furthermore, previous meta-analytic studies did not take the multivariate
data structure (i.e., neglecting correlated bivariate trait intercorrelations from primary studies)
into account which also warrants a more thorough test of the discriminant validity of D.
Objectives
This meta-analysis examined whether D measured by the DELTA inventory (Knežević
et al., 2017), qualifies as a separate personality trait dimension beyond the HEXACO,
assessed by the HEXACO-PI-R (Ashton & Lee, 2009; Lee & Ashton, 2018) or whether it is
absorbed. The aim of this study was to summarize the available primary study evidence on
the relationships between HEXACO and D. We assessed the discriminant validity of D,
based on the aggregated domain-level intercorrelations. We also tested whether and to what
extent the discriminant validity is challenged by the proportion of patients, students, and the
language version used which might lead to biased inferences when overlooked. In addition,
we evaluated the robustness of the discriminant validity against methodological fallacies of
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 9
primary studies induced by using outdated DELTA versions which include the later rejected
facet of Social Anhedonia , (un)reliability of the measures, reporting of outlier
intercorrelations or dependent intercorrelation matrices, and publication status.
Hypotheses
Hypothesis 1: Overall, we expected that D is distinct from any HEXACO trait. This
will be reflected by the HEXACO-D intercorrelations not exceeding the range of HEXACO
intercorrelations, i.e., we expected each of the six bivariate HEXACO-D intercorrelations
being equal or smaller than the largest absolute bivariate intercorrelation among the
HEXACO traits (H1).
As stated, D could not be adequately integrated into existing personality models (e.g.,
Knežević et al., 2016, 2019; Lazarević et al., 2016). Thus, D is unlikely to be absorbed by
other traits as it is a unique dimension. In addition to the primary findings in favor of D also
separating from the HEXACO (e.g., Ashton & Lee, 2012, 2019; Knežević et al., 2022a), we
do expect the same on the meta-analytic level across studies.
Hypothesis 2: We expected considerable heterogeneity in the aggregated HEXACO-D
intercorrelations, emphasizing the need for additional moderator analyses (H2.X).
Although we expected discriminant validity of D from the HEXACO, there are several
psychometric and empirical considerations that may undermine the generalizability of the
observed findings. Previous meta-analyses found notable heterogeneity within the pooled
intercorrelations between D and its trait counterparts, which was attributed to several
moderators such as mental health status, the assessment method, or positive/negative
schizotypy symptoms (Knežević et al., 2016, 2019; Lazarević et al., 2016). These moderators
significantly attenuated or inflated the absolute intercorrelations or caused different patterns
2 Note that prior to the publication of the final version of the DELTA instrument (Knežević et al.,
2017), Social Anhedonia was considered part of D (e.g. Međedović, 2014). However, due to
empirical evidence showing that Social Anhedonia was a primary indicator of low
Extraversion rather than D, the former was ultimately dropped from the D model.
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 10
of intercorrelations. This potentially leads to false interpretation or rejection of discriminant
validity as specified in the following hypotheses. However, the authors of these previous
studies claimed that none of the moderators questioned the generalizability of D 's
discriminant validity which is what we also expected for all subsequent moderator hypotheses
(H2.1-2.4).
Hypothesis 2.1: We expected that the percentage of clinical patients in the sample
significantly attenuates the absolute HEXACO-D intercorrelations (H2.1).
D is conceptualized as a continuum ranging from normal personality variations to
pathological schizotypal phenomena. In contrast, researchers such as Krueger and colleagues
(2012) conceptualized D as a strictly pathological phenomenon, with the result that it is
interpreted as a maladaptive personality variation limited to clinical contexts rather than a
continuous trait-like construct. Empirical evidence supports the continuous conceptualization,
with Knežević et al. (2017) demonstrating the normal distribution of D in a representative
sample of the general population and extracting a seven-factor solution (HEXACO+D), when
factorized either with the HEXACO items leaning toward the maladaptive or normal
personality variation pole (Knežević et al., 2022a). However, meta-analytic findings on
models covering both normal and abnormal personality variation found significant
heterogeneity in the intercorrelations of D with other traits due to clinical patient status
(Knežević et al., 2019, Lazarević et al., 2016). From a psychometric point of view,
differences might have been expected due to the increased homogeneity of clinical samples
and score range restrictions (Lazarević et al., 2016; Saulsman & Page, 2004). In fact, clinical
groups show higher levels of D, Big Five Neuroticism (N), and predominantly low Big Five
Extraversion, Agreeableness (A), and Conscientiousness (C) (Malouff et al., 2005). More
homogeneous participants are expected to respond in a similar manner and magnitude, e.g.,
endorsing high values on D and N items, resulting in skewed score distributions, less
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 11
deviation from the means, and less covariation between traits. Thus, it should be easier to
observe a distinct D in clinical samples due to this response bias.
Hypothesis 2.2: Similarly, we expected that the absolute HEXACO-D intercorrelations
are significantly reduced depending on the percentage of students in the sample (H2.2).
A distinct D factor from the Big Five emerged in both a large student and community
sample (Knežević et al., 2017), allowing D to be extracted in both homogeneous and more
heterogeneous samples. However, a meta-analytic investigation of D and the Big Five did
indeed observe two significantly changed intercorrelations in student samples compared to
non-student samples (Knežević et al., 2016). Student samples are comparable to clinical
samples in that they are also more homogeneous and unrepresentative of the general
population (Henrich et al., 2010). This, in turn, results in limited response variation, i.e.,
narrower and more skewed score distributions, and likely reduced intercorrelations as a
result.
Hypothesis 2.3 and 2.4: We expected that non-Serbian translations of the DELTA
instrument yield significantly increased absolute intercorrelations of D with Extraversion (X),
and H compared to Serbian versions (H2.3). Serbian versions of DELTA, on the other hand,
were expected to show significantly increased absolute intercorrelations of D with
Emotionality (E), and A compared to non-Serbian versions (H2.4).
The cross-cultural stability of the HEXACO structure was supported by extracting the
six HEXACO factors in 20 countries and 16 languages (Thielmann et al., 2020). Similarly,
the seven-factor structure (HEXACO+D) which includes a distinct D factor was obtained in
three separate European general population samples (Knežević et al., 2022a). Both studies
observed metric invariance between the various language versions of the HEXACO-PI-R and
the DELTA inventory, indicated by equal number of factors and factor loadings. Due to the
non-equal intercepts, cultural differences may lead to different interpretations of scale items
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 12
and make direct mean comparisons difficult. The same is true for cross-cultural comparisons
of the HEXACO-D intercorrelations which are based on the means. Interestingly, differing
intercorrelation patterns in Serbian and non-Serbian samples can be observed in the cross-
cultural study by Knežević and colleagues (2022a): D showed comparatively higher
intercorrelations with E and H in non-Serbian samples, while Serbian samples exhibited
considerably higher intercorrelations of D with E and A (|rs| > .30). This observation may be
attributed to cultural differences leading to varying interpretations of the items and changing
intercorrelation patterns, resulting in different HEXACO-D intercorrelations.
Method
This study was designed according to the PRISMA guidelines (Page et al., 2021).
Eligibility Criteria
Eligible documents and data had to meet the following criteria, which we created using
PICO-S (Amir-Behghadami & Janati, 2020), but we omitted Intervention and Comparison
due to the correlational design of this study. Population: There were no restrictions regarding
age, gender, or other sociodemographic characteristics. Outcome: Relevant studies reported
domain-level product-moment intercorrelations between any of the HEXACO traits and D,
based on total scores of the seven scales. Studies reporting only latent factor intercorrelations
were excluded. In cases where adequate intercorrelations could not be extracted, eligible
studies must at least report raw total scores per participant that allow the calculation of the
missing intercorrelations. Eligible studies measured HEXACO traits using either the
HEXACO-PI-R-60 or -100 (Ashton & Lee, 2009; Lee & Ashton, 2018), and D had to be
measured using any version of the DELTA inventory (Knežević et al., 2017). Other
conceptualizations of D were rejected because DELTA is the only index that captures the full
breadth of the domain, allowing for a more rigorous test of discriminant validity. Study
Design: There were no restrictions on publication language or publication type, including
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 13
unpublished or non-peer-reviewed data. However, studies conducted prior to 2014 were
excluded as, to our knowledge, Međedović (2014) was the first study to use the DELTA
inventory in combination with HEXACO.
Study Identification and Selection
Knežević et al. (2017) laid the theoretical groundwork for further investigations of the
relationships between D and other personality traits. Thus, their original publication served as
an ideal starting point for study identification. A forward search for studies citing the original
publication was conducted using Google Scholar, Web of Science, and PsychINFO. To
ensure a comprehensive literature base, the databases PsycINFO, Psyndex, ProQuest
Dissertations & Theses, PsycArticles, Medline, and Google Scholar were searched using the
terms ‘Disintegration’ AND ‘DELTA’ AND ‘HEXACO’ in all search fields. This combined
search strategy accounted for the possibility that researchers associated with Knežević, and
colleagues investigated the HEXACO-D relationship prior to the publication of the DELTA
instrument (e.g., Međedović, 2014; Lapčević, 2015). This minimized the risk of missing
relevant articles. Because primary studies do not regularly report intercorrelation matrices in
their manuscripts, we extended the search to the data repositories OSF, PsychArchives,
Harvard Dataverse, Mendeley Data, Figshare, Kaggle, and Google Dataset Search using the
same search terms as above. In addition, we were provided with unpublished data from
publications, gray literature, and dissertations by the original authors.
The screening automation tool Rayyan (Ouzzani et al., 2016) was only used for data
management and as an interface for manual screening by human reviewers. Bibliographic
information of identified studies with corresponding titles and abstracts was uploaded as a
.RIS file to Rayyan, which automatically identified duplicates prior to screening. Title-
abstract screening was performed by two independent reviewers using Rayyan's blinding
feature for parallel reviews. In case of discrepancies, the studies were discussed until a
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 14
consensus was reached. Raw data was reviewed separately in an Excel spreadsheet. The
resulting collection of potentially relevant articles was then uploaded into a separate Rayyan
review along with the full-text pdfs to assess the eligibility of each study. The raw data was
also evaluated in detail. As before, the full-text screening was performed by the same
independent reviewers. Disagreements regarding eligibility were discussed until a consensus
was reached. Interrater agreement was calculated for each step of the screening process. The
first reviewer was the main author who had experience in screening. The second reviewer

and was completed on July 13 2023.
Data Extraction and Coding Procedure
The coding scheme was developed based on the PsychOpen CAMA template (Burgard
et al., 2021) to assess descriptive information on four levels in descending order regarding the
reports, the studies conducted, the samples examined, and the respective intercorrelations per
(sub)sample. Pearson product-moment intercorrelations were extracted directly or computed
as effect size measures between DELTA and HEXACO PI-R total scores, as needed.
Similarly, the sample sizes of the primary studies were required to account for the precision
of each study in the calculation of the aggregated intercorrelation matrix. The available
information was coded as fine-grained as possible, for example if a study reported three
separate intercorrelation matrices for three different samples (e.g., Knežević et al., 2022a),
the data were coded at the sub-sample/group level. The proportion of patients, the combined
proportion of individuals with completed and ongoing higher education (proportion of
students, i.e., individuals with > 12 years of education), and the language of the questionnaire
were the hypothesized moderator variables that may affect the discriminant validity of D. The
first two moderators were coded as continuous variables so that studies with mixed samples
could be included in the moderator analysis which otherwise had to be excluded. The greatest
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 15
risks of bias in primary studies were scale unreliability and the use of DELTA versions that
include the irrelevant facet of Social Anhedonia. If reliability was not reported in the primary
studies, they were computed using item-level responses. However, when reliabilities could
not be computed, they were imputed using the meta-analytically aggregated reliability
estimate with the Bonett (2002) transformation to normalize the alpha distributions and
stabilize the alpha variances. To this end, we also extracted the number of items for each
questionnaire. Both fallacies lead to potential attenuation of the intercorrelations, so they
were coded to allow later sensitivity analysis to measure their impact on the results. In
addition, several descriptive variables were extracted to describe the characteristics of the
subjects and samples studied in the literature.
Coding was performed by the first author for all studies and by two independent second
coders who each rated half of the studies, allowing the calculation of interrater reliability
using Krippendorff's alpha. Any discrepancies were discussed until a final consensus was
achieved. Corresponding authors of eligible documents or data were contacted to obtain
missing intercorrelation matrices or raw data, and missing information on the moderator
variables, if they were not retrievable otherwise. If duplicate samples were observed at the
data extraction stage as indicated by the same authors, data retrieval dates, sample sizes,
effect sizes, and sample descriptives, only the earliest report was included in the analyses.
Documents and data in a different language than German or English were translated via
Google Translate (Google LLC, 2023) to increase coverage of relevant studies and extraction
th th
of information. The coding procedure began on July 10 and was completed on August 16 ,
2023.
Criteria for Determining Discriminant Validity
Following previous meta-analytic assessments of the discriminant validity of D (e.g.,
Knežević et al., 2016), we used the range of the aggregated HEXACO intercorrelations as a
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 16
reference point and the maximum absolute HEXACO intercorrelation as a benchmark for
assuming the distinction of D. First, we computed the difference score between any absolute
HEXACO-D intercorrelation (e.g., |𝑟 |) and the amount of the benchmark (e.g., |𝑟 |).
𝐻𝐷 𝐻𝐴
Then, to account for sampling error, we calculated the standard error (SE) of the difference
score as the square root of the sampling variance (Cheung, 2015):
𝑆𝐸 = √(𝑣𝑎𝑟 (𝑟 ) + 𝑣𝑎𝑟 (𝑟 ) − 2 𝑐𝑜𝑣 (𝑟 , 𝑟 )) (Equation 1).
𝐻𝐷 𝐻𝐴 𝐻𝐷 𝐻𝐴
Finally, we computed the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference score. This allowed
us to assess whether the true intercorrelations differ, meaning that D falls within the
HEXACO intercorrelation range and can be considered distinct from the HEXACO traits, or
falls outside the HEXACO intercorrelation range, suggesting its absorption by HEXACO. We
determined the strength of evidence by the significance of the difference score, indicated by
the CI not containing zero. The interpretation in favor of distinction or convergence of D is
determined by the sign of the difference score. A negative difference indicates the former, a
positive difference indicates the latter.
While the CIs indicate the precision of the measurement, we additionally examined
the prediction intervals (PI) to gain insight into the distribution of the true effects for each
intercorrelation and how their true relationships vary across contexts and populations (i.e.,
examining the dispersion; Borenstein et al., 2017). The PI allows researchers and
practitioners alike to anticipate effect sizes in future assessments (Harrer et al., 2021). An
illustration of the inference criteria can be found in the electronic supplementary material
Data Synthesis and Analysis Plan
To aggregate the individual intercorrelation matrices of the primary studies in a single
multivariate analysis, which also addressed the issue of the same study reporting multiple
dependent effect sizes (i.e., up to 21 HEXACO-D intercorrelations), we performed the first
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 17
step of the two-stage structural equation modeling approach (TSSEM; Cheung, 2014), which
is a form of meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM, Cheung & Chan, 2005).
Accordingly, the intercorrelation matrices are pooled meta-analytically using fixed or
random-effects models (Hedges & Vevea, 1998) and applying maximum likelihood
estimation. The two available models differ in their assumptions about the aggregated effects.
The fixed effects model assumes that there is only one true effect and that all observed
variation in the effects is the result of sampling error. The random effects model (Borenstein
et al., 2009; Hedges, 2016), on the other hand, assumes that each study effect has its own true
population effect, which in turn is part of a supra-population of true effects. The random
effects model seemed appropriate in our case because the scales were used in different target
populations, such as clinical or general population samples.
Jak and Cheung (2020) highlighted the possibility of assessing the heterogeneity of the
aggregated intercorrelations from the first stage of TSSEM through multivariate meta-
regressions. Univariate meta-regression examines the influence of one or more moderators on
a single criterion variable. In the case of multiple criterion variables, the interdependence of
these variables must be considered. Accordingly, the intercorrelations of the primary studies
were nested in samples. In this way, the effect of moderator variables on multiple
intercorrelations can be assessed simultaneously. We modeled three separate multivariate
meta-regression models for each moderator variable, assessing the influence of the latter on
the former. A combined analysis of all moderators in a single model would have suffered
from information loss, as only cases with complete information on all three variables could
be included, artificially limiting the available evidence. Statistical analyses were performed
in R (R Core Team, 2023; version 4.3.1) using the ‘metaSEM’ package (Cheung, 2015;
In addition, we exploratively compared univariate with multivariate meta-regressions to assess
the impact of neglecting the data structure on the moderator analysis. See the electronic
supplement material for a full discussion (see pp.6-10;

version 1.3.0) and the ‘metafor’ package (Viechtbauer, 2010; version 4.2). The analysis script
Sensitivity Analyses
To validate the robustness of the aggregated HEXACO-D intercorrelations to the risk
of bias, we conducted several additional analyses. As the inclusion of the Social Anhedonia
facets in DELTA-10 versions might inflate the X-D intercorrelation, we repeated the main
analysis in the DELTA-9 (i.e., D without Social Anhedonia) and DELTA-10 subgroups. To
assess whether the inclusion of Social Anhedonia leads to different intercorrelation patterns,
we performed a multivariate meta-regression with the DELTA version as the only moderator.
Another source of potential bias was outlier intercorrelation matrices that were only
loosely related to most other matrices. Statistical outliers were identified by multivariate
internally standardized residuals (Viechtbauer & Cheung, 2010) with adjusted p-values
(Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995) due to alpha error inflation. Influential matrices were detected
by Cook's distance values (1977) that exceeded three standard deviations of the mean
distance score. Reports fulfilling both criteria were treated as outliers, and they were
excluded from a repeated analysis.
There are no established methods for assessing publication bias in MASEM (Gnambs
& Schroeders, 2024). One indicator of publication bias is publication status, so it is
recommended to separate the data into peer-reviewed and unpublished. We first compared
the significance tests of the difference scores for both subsets. Secondly, publication status
was included as a moderator variable in a multivariate meta-regression model to assess
whether and to what extent underlying reporting bias, such as reporting overall higher or
lower intercorrelations, might challenge the discriminant validity of D.
We performed a fourth sensitivity analysis assessing the impact of dependent effect
sizes. MASEM assumes independent intercorrelation matrices with the usual
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 19
recommendation being to limit each study to contributing only a single matrix (Jak &
Cheung, 2018, 2020). Multiple reported intercorrelation matrices may lead to biased
parameter estimates and standard errors, potentially affecting the assessment of discriminant
validity. Accordingly, we averaged the information of highly intercorrelated intercorrelation
matrices that were based on the same sample and reconducted the analyses with the smaller
dataset.
Furthermore, Gnambs and Sengewald (2023) showed that MASEM estimates are
affected by measurement error due to the unreliability of primary studies. Accordingly, the
main analysis and the three moderator analyses were rerun using intercorrelations corrected
for measurement error. Following classical test theory, the raw intercorrelation coefficient
was divided by the square root of the product of the HEXACO-PI-R and DELTA scale
reliabilities, so that
𝑟 = 𝑟 ⁄ √𝑟𝑒𝑙 × 𝑟𝑒𝑙 (Equation 2).
corrected raw HEXACO−PI−R DELTA
The results of the sensitivity analyses provided the basis for assessing the overall strength of
the evidence and whether future studies might change the confidence in the current findings.
Nevertheless, the corrected coefficients reflected the best possible estimates of the true
effects and allowed a robust assessment of the discriminant validity of D more so than any
primary study alone.
Results
Study Identification and Selection Process
Initially, we identified 256 reports through forward-searching and searching databases
and data repositories. Additionally, we received a combination of published and unpublished
data and reports from the authors of the D model, totaling 42 primary reports and datasets,
which were evaluated alongside the potentially relevant articles identified by title-abstract
screening. A total of 65 reports and datasets were assessed in detail for eligibility. Ultimately,
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 20
we identified 37 unique reports and datasets that contributed 39 studies, which in turn
investigated 42 unique samples, and reported 47 intercorrelation matrices. Almost all reports
and datasets (46/47) reported complete intercorrelation matrices. The PRISMA Flowchart

reliability was adequate for title-abstract screening (Krippendorff's alpha = .79) and moderate
for full-text screening (Krippendorff's alpha = .55). All discrepancies were discussed,
ensuring no relevant reports were missed. The double coding procedure showed satisfactory
agreement, with Krippendorff's alpha averaging .83 and .85 between coders. All
disagreements were resolved through detailed discussions.
Study Characteristics
The cumulative sample size was N = 17,092. The average sample consisted of 363.7
participants (median = 263, SD = 437.2), ranging from 39 to 2,792 participants. The mean
age across all samples was 29.31 (SD = 9.38, range: 13.68 - 43.91) and the average sample
contained 59% females. In the aggregated dataset, 29 samples partially or fully assessed
students, with an average of 55% undergraduate and graduate students (SD = 0.38). Only 7
samples assessed clinical participants. On average, 17% (SD = 0.38) of the participants in
these samples were classified as clinical. Most reports (n = 40) used the original Serbian
version of the DELTA instrument, whereas 7 reports used a translated version. Similarly,
studies were primarily conducted in Serbia (n = 40), followed by 3 in the US, 2 in Germany,
and 1 in Kosovo and the UK respectively. Almost a third (28%) of the data were assessed
with a DELTA-10 version that included the later rejected subscale of Social Anhedonia. The
collected data covered the years 2013 to 2023, with the average report coming from 2020
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 21
(median = 2021). The majority (68%) of the included reports and datasets were neither peer-
reviewed nor published, meaning that we would have missed most of the available evidence
had we relied solely on the search strategy. Details on the included studies are available on

parentheses [x, y]. * indicates significance with p < .05.
Accordingly, the intercorrelations of D with H, E A, and O were significantly smaller than
the benchmark intercorrelation (H-A), thus falling within the range of the HEXACO
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 23
intercorrelations supporting the discriminant validity of D from H, E, A, and O. However, the
intercorrelations of D with X and C exceeded H-A by an absolute .02. This positive
difference was non-significant as both CIs contained zero, indicating weak convergent
validity and potential conceptual overlap. This means that the true X-D and C-D
intercorrelations may be outside the range of the HEXACO estimates. Thus, our first
hypothesis was only partially supported. The observed convergence trend of D with C and X
was comparatively small, non-significant, and may be negligible from a substantive point of
view as further analyses suggest.
The PIs of the pooled intercorrelations provide insights into the distribution of true
The average HEXACO-D intercorrelation (r = -.15) has a wider PI ranging from -.29 to .01,
compared to the average HEXACO intercorrelation of r = .08 [-.06, .22]. The PIs of the E-D
and the O-D intercorrelations are the only HEXACO-D intercorrelation intervals that contain
zero. Thus, most studies would indeed observe some overlap of D with the HEXACO traits.
Speaking of the latter, we observed that the H-A, H-C, E-X, X-A, X-C, and C-O
intercorrelation contain the benchmark value of r = .29 or even larger values. In fact, E-X
ranging up to |.44| was the largest possible HEXACO intercorrelation according to the PIs.
Taken together, this means that there are potentially substantial intercorrelations between the
conceptually distinct HEXACO traits. The PIs of the HEXACO-D intercorrelations, on the
other hand, reflect the inferences from the difference scores. The largest possible true effects
of HEXACO-D can be expected in C-D and X-D with absolute r = .47 which corresponds to
them being non-significantly larger than the largest absolute HEXACO intercorrelation,
indicating that only a few values were outside the HEXACO intercorrelation range, but
importantly not all of them. Thus, discriminant validity cannot be clearly rejected in these
two cases. All other HEXACO-D intercorrelations are smaller than the largest possible true
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 24
effect of HEXACO (rs < |.44|). Thus, the PIs support the interpretation that D is conceptually
separate from H, E, A, and O, as these four intercorrelations are covered by the possible
range of true HEXACO effect sizes.
Additionally, the Q test (df = 946, p < .001) was highly significant, indicating
considerable heterogeneity in the pooled intercorrelations, supporting hypothesis 2. More
2 2 2
precisely, the absolute amount of heterogeneity (τ ) ranged from τ = .001 to τ = .031 with a
2 2
mean τ of .006 (SD = .006). The relative heterogeneity (I ) of the intercorrelation estimates
2 2 2
was moderate I = .29 to high I = .92 with an overall moderate I of .62 (SD = .16) according
to Harrer et al. (2021). The heterogeneity estimates for the pooled intercorrelations are
presented in the electronic supplementary material (ESM C.2;
investigation of moderators inducing some of this heterogeneity was justified.
Moderator Analysis
Starting with the proportion of patients, the Q test (df = 820, p < .001) indicated
significant residual heterogeneity even after accounting for the influence of patients. Despite
increasing the absolute intercorrelations of D with H, E, X, C, and O with an increasing
proportion of patients, none of these effects reached significance. Similarly, the absolute
decrease in the A-D intercorrelation due to patients was not significant. Compared to the
model without a moderator, this was reflected in the small changes in the relative
heterogeneity estimates ranging from -2% to -25%. Accordingly, we conclude that the
proportion of patients does not affect the HEXACO-D intercorrelations at all, making the
discriminant validity of D robust to clinical status, contrary to our expectation (H2.1) (see
The model including the proportion of students in the sample showed significant
residual heterogeneity (Q = 1,718, df = 672, p < .001). Only the moderation effect on E-D
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 25
was significant (p = .02), decreasing the intercorrelation by .14 per standard deviation,
meaning that increasing numbers of students attenuate this intercorrelation. Likewise, the
change in relative heterogeneity compared to the model without moderator was even smaller
in this model than in the moderator model including patients, ranging from -3% to -15%.
Therefore, hypothesis 2.2 is largely rejected (see ESM E.2;
models, there was no consistent pattern in the intercorrelations suggesting that scale range
restrictions lead to reduced intercorrelations. Thus, the observed discriminant validity of D in
the raw intercorrelations cannot be considered an artifact of sample homogeneity.
Finally, we examined the sole influence of the language version of the DELTA
instrument by comparing the original Serbian version with the translated versions. This
moderator proved to be the most influential. In general, we observed larger absolute
intercorrelations in the translated DELTA versions, except for the X-D intercorrelation,
which was the other way around. This moderation was significant for the intercorrelations of
D with H (p = .01) and C (p = .03), resulting in absolute values of r = .32 and r = .41
respectively. There was also a trend for an increasing A-D intercorrelation, as indicated by its
near significance (p = .05). However, there remained significant residual heterogeneity (Q =
3,003, df = 925, p < .001) and we observed only small changes in the relative heterogeneity
ranging from -1% to -20%. Thus, hypothesis 2.3 was only partially supported; in contrast,
hypothesis 2.4 had to be rejected (see ESM E.3,
that translated versions show inflated intercorrelations at first glance, which could affect the
discriminant validity of D in non-Serbian languages or cultures.
Sensitivity Analyses
Impact of Social Anhedonia, Outliers, and Dependent Effect Sizes
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 26
The multivariate internally standardized residuals revealed three significant statistical
outliers (ps < .05). Four samples were classified as influential matrices because each had
values greater than three times the SD of the mean Cook’s distance, which was 0.50 (SD =
.33). Two reports met both conditions and were therefore classified as outliers. In addition,
we identified five reports that reported multiple matrices that were based on the same sample
during coding. These matrices were likely not independent of each other, as indicated by their
high intercorrelations, which ranged from r = .68 up to r = .90, with most rs > .75.
Overall, we replicated the inferences from the main analysis, showing that the
discriminant validity of D from H, E, A, and O, as well as the trend for convergence of D
with X and C (i.e., the non-significantly increased intercorrelations by absolute .01 to .04), is
robust to including Social Anhedonia, removing outlier matrices, and dependent effect sizes
Social Anhedonia as a moderator revealed only a single significant difference in the A-D
intercorrelation, which had a higher magnitude when Social Anhedonia was excluded, but
this did not call into question the discriminant validity of D from A (see ESM F;
reconducted moderation analyses without outliers (see ESM G.1 – G.3;
sizes (see ESM H1. – H.3;
marginal differences in the translation effects. The exclusion of outliers led to the effect of
translation on the C-D intercorrelation losing significance at p = .05. Accounting for multiple
dependent information, the moderating effect of translation reached significance for the A-D
intercorrelation (p = .03), in addition to the previously observed moderation effect on the
intercorrelations of D with H (p < .01) and C (p = .04). This means that the intercorrelations
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 27
of translated DELTA instrument versions showed significantly increased absolute estimates
of .10 up to .13 in half of the HEXACO-D intercorrelations. At this stage, the effects of
translation appear to be unstable and only partially replicated. The most likely reason for this
is the attenuated intercorrelations due to measurement error on which these analyses are
based, as we will show later.
Publication Bias
Given the fact that most of the data in the analysis came from unpublished manuscripts
and datasets that were provided by the original developers of the D model, we can safely
assume that all the available evidence on the HEXACO-D relationship has been collected.
However, there still was the possibility of a systematic reporting bias. Unlike the previous
analyses, there were noticeable differences in the difference scores of the published and
with the sole exception of the non-significantly smaller X-D intercorrelation compared to the
benchmark. Looking at the peer-reviewed subgroup, the H-D intercorrelation lost
significance, as indicated by the CI containing both positive and negative values, but the
difference remained negative, indicating weak discriminant validity. The X-D
intercorrelation, on the other hand, reached statistical significance with a positive difference
of .06 compared to the benchmark. However, these descriptive differences were misleading
because the limited information in the published subset led to unreliable solutions. To
examine whether the HEXACO-D intercorrelations truly differed due to publication status,
we conducted a multivariate meta-regression moderator analysis which used all the available
information (see ESM I;
that only the A-D intercorrelation was significantly larger by an absolute .07 (p = .04),
increasing the intercorrelation to r = -.21 in the peer-reviewed data compared to the
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 28
unpublished data. All other estimates were statistically indifferent. Furthermore, we did not
observe a consistent pattern such as reporting larger or smaller intercorrelations overall in the
peer-reviewed data. Taken together, none of the general inferences regarding convergence or
distinction from the main analysis were challenged by publication bias.
Attenuation for Measurement Error
To get a clear understanding of the observed differences in the difference scores and
moderation effects, we assessed the intercorrelations corrected for unreliability.
Descriptively, the intercorrelations only differed in magnitude compared to the raw
to
from r = -.15 (E-X) r = .38 (H-A), and the simple average HEXACO intercorrelation was
r = .10 (SD = .14). The corrected HEXACO-D intercorrelations, on the other hand, ranged
to
from r = -.37 (C-D) r = .17 (E-D) and the average intercorrelation was r = -.17 (SD =
.21). Similarly, we observed increased heterogeneity estimates for the corrected
intercorrelations (see ESM C.2;
indicated significant heterogeneity in the pooled estimates (df = 946, p < .001).
The attenuation for measurement error also led to increased differences between the
absolute intercorrelation of D with H, E, A, and O, and the benchmark compared to the raw
when measurement error is removed from the equation. Contrary to the initial observation of
weak convergent validity of D with X and C, we observed the opposite pattern in the
corrected intercorrelations. Accordingly, the non-significant difference became negative,
supporting the weak discriminant validity of D. Nevertheless, X-D and C-D remained the
highest overlapping HEXACO-D intercorrelations, suggesting some conceptual overlap
between these constructs. Similarly, the hypothesis of convergence could not be rejected
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 29
either. However, we interpreted this changing pattern, together with the strengthened
evidence for the other traits in favor of the general discriminant validity of D from the
HEXACO. Thus, the main hypothesis (H1) was supported after accounting for measurement
error.
Looking at the PIs of the corrected intercorrelations, there are only minor differences
compared to the PIs of the raw intercorrelations (see ESM C.1;
HEXACO intercorrelation (r = .11) has a PI ranging from r = -.12 to r = .32, while the mean
HEXACO-D intercorrelation of r = -.17 has a wider PI ranging from r = -.37 to r = .03. The
HEXACO intercorrelations show a tendency to overlap, as the PIs of the H-A, H-C, E-X, X-
C, X-O, and the C-O intercorrelations all include the value of the largest absolute HEXACO
intercorrelation of r = .39. As in the main analysis, we observed the highest absolute true
values of the HEXACO-D intercorrelations in X-D and C-D at r = .55, which was slightly
greater than the highest observable absolute HEXACO intercorrelation, E-X, which ranged
up to r = .54. This further demonstrates that most of the true effects of the HEXACO-D
intercorrelations are included within the HEXACO intercorrelation range of true effects
rather than laying outside, supporting the discriminant validity of D from the HEXACO
traits.
The reconducted multivariate meta-regressions assessing the influence of increasing
sample homogeneity, either by patients or students, on the corrected HEXACO-D
intercorrelations reproduced the main findings of both models (see ESM J.1 & J.2;
comparison of the language versions of the DELTA instrument showed a different picture
translation emerged as the most influential moderator of the raw HEXACO-D
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 30
intercorrelations, we observed no significant effects in the corrected intercorrelations, except
for the H-D intercorrelation, which approached significance (p = .05). Regardless of this, we
still observed increased intercorrelations in the translated DELTA instrument versions
compared to the Serbian version for all intercorrelations except the X-D intercorrelation,
where it was the other way around. Although we ultimately rejected hypotheses 2.3 and 2.4,
researchers and practitioners alike should be aware of the tendencies for varying
intercorrelation estimates, which differed by up to .12 solely due to the use of different
language versions. Thus, the observed differences in the raw intercorrelations in the previous
moderator analysis and sensitivity analyses were likely overestimated due to measurement
error.
Discussion
This pre-registered meta-analysis is the first to assess the empirical evidence on
whether the trait-like dimension of PLEBs, conceptualized as D, has discriminant validity
beyond the HEXACO at the meta-analytic level. The main finding of this study is that D
indeed shows small to moderate intercorrelations (i.e., range = |.01| - |.31) that are within the
D from the HEXACO. Furthermore, our findings were robust to methodological flaws of
primary studies such as the inclusion of Social Anhedonia in D measures, outliers, data
moderator effects of sample homogeneity due to patients or students, nor conclusive
translation effects that would challenge the discriminant validity of D. We observed a weak
convergence trend for C-D and X-D which exhibited the largest absolute intercorrelations,
but the difference was insignificant and small compared to the benchmark (∆ = |.02|),
max
hardly calling into question the discriminant validity of D. From a theoretical perspective, the
former could be explained by a general impairment of executive control in highly
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 31
disintegrative individuals, related to low C. Similarly, high levels of D might lead to peer
rejection due to exhibiting strange thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, or to active avoidance of
social interactions due to paranoia or rapid emotional changes, captured by the latter. Similar
patterns have been found empirically, as Malouff et al. (2005) observed extreme levels of D
and Big Five N, and low levels of Big Five Extraversion, A, and C in clinical groups.
To put the current findings into perspective, it is worth bearing in mind that it is not
uncommon to find absolute intercorrelations of up to .40 in meta-analyses of basic
personality traits. For example, a meta-analysis assessing the discriminant validity of D from
the Big Five based their benchmark of .40 on meta-analytically averaged Big Five
intercorrelations from different meta-analyses (Knežević et al., 2016). Similarly, several
meta-analyses show that also some HEXACO intercorrelations exceed r = .40 (e.g.,
Moshagen et al., 2019; Pletzer et al., 2020; Zettler et al., 2020). The main point here is not
that the specific value of .40 is or is not a valid benchmark, but rather that it shows that
moderate intercorrelations can be observed empirically, even between the theoretically
distinct Big Five and HEXACO traits. Thus, the observed HEXACO-D intercorrelations fit
into this picture. Moreover, another crucial element that a reader should be aware of when
evaluating the evidence for the discriminant validity of D is that both the Big Five and the
HEXACO model are top-down personality models, meaning that their upper levels (domains)
are empirically based, while their facets are conceptual constructs designed to minimize
overlap between factors. D, on the other hand, is a bottom-up construct par excellence, based
on the results of factor analyses of nearly a thousand indicators (Knežević et al., 2017). It is
not constructed to maximize the variance of the higher-order (D) factor, but to be
comprehensive for the domain of PLEBs, without regard to possible overlap with other
personality domains. In fact, it is surprising that such a strategy did not result in more overlap
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 32
with models that aim to comprehensively capture personality variation, which is the basic
idea of models based on the lexical approach (e.g., Saucier, 1997; de Vries, 2020).
Contributions to the PLEBs-Personality Debate
Several researchers have challenged the trait-like conceptualization of D, either by
attempting to assign D to existing taxonomies (e.g., DeYoung et al., 2012) or by locating it
outside normal personality space (e.g., Ashton & Lee, 2019; Krueger et al., 2012). Since both
positions would preserve the more parsimonious personality structures of the Big Five or
HEXACO, they are worth discussing.
Several authors have argued that maladaptive and normal personality can be viewed as
opposite poles on a shared personality continuum. They proposed substantial overlap of
positive symptoms of D with extreme levels of O (DeYoung et al., 2012; Dilchert et al.,
2015; Widiger, 2011) and the possibility of conceptualizing psychotic-like phenomena as an
extreme of O and not a distinct trait per se. This assumption was based on the inverse
relationship between positive and negative symptoms of schizotypy and O (Chmielewski &
Watson, 2008; Ross et al., 2002), positive for the former and negative for the latter. Given the
current and previous findings however, we doubt that D nor its indices can be equated with
O. In fact, the O-D intercorrelation was the smallest observed HEXACO-D intercorrelation,
which was close to zero in all analyses. Similarly, we observed the largest difference for O-D
from the benchmark suggesting that D and O are indeed the farthest apart in a combined
HEXACOD framework. The same was found in the meta-analysis of the Big Five model
(Knežević et al., 2016). Due to the domain-level focus of this study, we were unable to
examine Chmielewski et al.'s (2014) proposal to split O into a pure Openness and an Intellect
component. Accordingly, the Intellect facet of O is expected to mask the substantial
relationship between pure O and positive symptoms of D, suggesting conceptual overlap.
However, this proposal has repeatedly failed to withstand empirical evidence in the Big Five
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 33
and HEXACO frameworks (Knežević et al., 2017, 2022a, Ristić et al., 2023). In joint factor
analyses, low intercorrelations are observed between pure O and the aspects of D
corresponding to the positive symptoms of schizotypy, even when controlling for the
inhibitory effects of Intellect. Thus, there is currently no convincing evidence for a fusion of
D and O.
In contrast to the trait-like conceptualization of D, Krueger and colleagues (2012)
conceptualized D as a strictly pathological phenomenon. In this vein, it is interpreted as a
maladaptive personality variation that is limited to clinical contexts. For this reason, we
modeled the proportion of patients as a moderator to investigate whether the intercorrelations
differ depending on the clinical status of the participants. Like the Big Five, the HEXACO
model covers primarily normal personality variation. Like the meta-analysis by Knežević et
al. (2016), the proportion of patients did not affect the estimates at all, which was robust
across all sensitivity analyses. Surprisingly, scale range restrictions, which we expected to
reduce the absolute intercorrelations depending on the number of patients, had no effect.
However, there were few studies that assessed patients and even smaller proportions of
patients within these studies, limiting the influence of such range restriction effects.
Nevertheless, most of our data consisted of representative samples of the general population
for which we found evidence of the discriminant validity of D. If PLEBs were indeed as rare
or irrelevant as claimed, it would be surprising to find a distinct D dimension indicated by
comparatively small intercorrelations in non-clinical samples. This cannot be explained by D
resulting from mere sampling bias and reflecting only psychopathology or pathological
personality variation. In this context, it is also not surprising that a recent study replicated the
extended Big Five+D model in both clinical and normal samples and showed that the 6-factor
model fit better than more parsimonious structures in which D persisted while the Big Five
factors tended to merge (Ristić et al., 2023).

However, there is also the possibility that the distinct D dimension may be caused by
measurement artifacts. Like clinical samples, student samples run the risk of sample
homogeneity leading to reduced absolute intercorrelations, which could lead to false-positive
inferences of discriminant validity. We observed only a single robust effect like scale range
restrictions in the E-D intercorrelation. There were no other consistent patterns indicating a
general tendency for student samples to have reduced absolute intercorrelations. Similar
effects have been previously explained by the higher cognitive abilities of students to better
compensate for the negative effects of D on executive control (Knežević et al., 2016).
Accordingly, the reduced absolute E-D intercorrelation can be explained in the same way as
the reduced absolute C-D intercorrelation. If higher cognitive abilities compensate for the
negative effects of D on executive control, then this may also be true for emotional control.
Previous research supports this interpretation, as D has been shown to be associated with
diminished emotion processing (Kerns, 2006) and relates to emotion regulation (Barthelmäs
& Keller, 2021). In this sense, the higher cognitive abilities of the students reduce these
negative relationships between D and E.
Similarly important was the assessment of bias due to translation, for which we found
no consistent evidence. In particular, the translation effects that did emerge barely scratch the
.40 benchmark by at most .01. Thus, the practical significance of the observed differences
remains questionable. This is supported by the fact that all effects disappeared when
measurement error was taken into account. Since there is evidence for the cross-cultural
replicability of the HEXACO+D model (Knežević et al., 2022a), some different
intercorrelations should be expected due to cultural or linguistic differences, but none should
call into question the general separation of D from the HEXACO traits.

Limitations
The first major limitation of this study was the simplified structure of the extended
HEXACOD model (Knežević et al., 2022a). Due to focusing on the domain-level
intercorrelations, we were not able to test the proposed factorial structure of the model, nor
could we make any further conclusions about the exact nature of D and the HEXACO. As D
was primarily constructed to represent the breadth of the PLEBs domain rather than to reduce
its overlap with existing traits (Knežević et al., 2022a), it is possible that some of the
proposed subscales of D have considerable off-target loadings on other traits. Likely
candidates for the observed overlap in X-D are Apathy/Depression and Mania, which may be
related to the low and high poles of X, respectively, and the General Executive/Cognitive
Impairment facet of D, which may be substantially related to the low pole of C. Alternatively,
there is the possibility that some indicators of D are better understood as indicators of other
traits altogether, as was the case for Social Anhedonia and Big Five Extraversion (Knežević
et al., 2017). Likewise, the content of the D model itself may be subject to change (Knežević
et al., 2017; 2022a). A likely candidate for this is the affective subscales of
Apathy/Depression, Mania, and Flattened Affect. Rather than being rooted in D per se, their
common nature of emotional instability and rapid affective changes probably is.
Consequently, it is necessary to examine the hierarchical model structure and identify the
optimal measurement model and potential interstitial subscales that do not load clearly on a
single dimension. This way, the usefulness of an extended HEXACOD model might be
enhanced.
Second, and in contrast to previous meta-analytic assessments of the discriminant
validity of D, we restricted our data to the DELTA instrument. Consequently, our results are
limited to a smaller literature base. As D represents the most comprehensive bottom-up
conceptualization of the PLEBs domain, using its DELTA measure still allows for a thorough
DOES DISINTEGRATION QUALIFY AS A SEPARATE TRAIT EXTENDING THE HEXACO MODEL? 36
test of whether the domain is unique from the HEXACO at all. However, future research
using a more diverse set of D measures is warranted to validate the current findings.
Third, regarding the literature base itself, we found that most reports were based on
Serbian community samples. Accordingly, there was too little data to answer conclusively
whether translated DELTA versions show systematically different intercorrelations. Future
evaluations of HEXACO-D in non-Serbian samples are warranted to test the cross-cultural
generalizability of the model. Even though translation and culture effects are likely to be
confounded, this is unproblematic for the more general question of systematic differences in
aggregated HEXACO-D intercorrelations regardless of their origin. Although the proportion
of students did not affect the discriminant validity of D overall, in many cases the primary
studies did not distinguish between individuals who were in higher education and those who
had completed it. Because graduates are not fully comparable to undergraduates, this
modification may have introduced heterogeneity within the proportion of students, limiting
the effect of scale range restriction effects. Regardless, we argue that graduate students are as
unrepresentative of the general population as undergraduate students and, on the other hand,
more like undergraduate students than individuals without higher education. In any case, we
observed an overrepresentation of academics (i.e., the proportion of undergraduate and
graduate students) in the general population samples, which limits the generalizability of our
results. The same is true for the rather small number of reports that assessed the clinical status
of their participants. This may be due to the focus of the HEXACO model, which aims to
capture normal personality variation. However, there were significant patient effects in
models that also cover abnormal personality variation (Knežević et al., 2019; Lazarević et al.,
2016), likely due to a higher number of patients overall. Consequently, all moderator analyses
suffered from limited information.

Conclusion
Taken together, we can confidently conclude that D, or more generally speaking
PLEBs, is indeed a distinct construct beyond the HEXACO or any other established
personality model (Knežević et al., 2016, 2019; Lazarević et al., 2016). This interpretation is
based on a substantial body of research showing the trait-like characteristics of D. Similarly,
alternative claims about the relationship between D and HEXACO were not convincing or
could not adequately explain the current or previous findings of discriminant validity.
Whether or not to extend existing personality models with a D factor should be carefully
evaluated in terms of parsimony, replicability, and effectiveness (de Vries, 2020).
Accordingly, simpler models are only sacrificed in favor of increased predictive validity (i.e.,
effectiveness), as was the case with the HEXACO that predict unique phenomena that are not
adequately captured by the more parsimonious Big Five (Ashton & Lee, 2019; Thielmann et
al., 2022). An important requirement for predictive validity is support for discriminant
validity, which we demonstrated in the current study. Thus, initial evidence that D does
indeed have incremental validity can be interpreted as first indications of the potential
usefulness of adding D to existing personality models. However, a comprehensive overview
of the predictive validity of D and systematic model comparisons is currently missing.
Accordingly, the current meta-analysis cannot conclusively answer the question of model
extension, but it adds to a growing body of research that supports this view.
