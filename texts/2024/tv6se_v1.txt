Abstract
Problem-gambling, an escalating global concern, disproportionately affects men. This study in-
vestigated the joint effects of social support and loneliness on the well-established link between
depressive-vulnerability and problem-gambling. Utilising a large representative survey of Australian
men (n = 5,204) ranging between 16 and 64 years (M = 44.25, SD = 12.08) who completed mea-
sures of problem-gambling, depressive-vulnerability, loneliness, and social support in 2020 and then
again in 2022, a moderated-mediation model was tested. Even after controlling for several covariates,
the results supported the hypothesis that the effects of depressive-vulnerability on problem-gambling
are influenced by social support and loneliness, R = .262, F (12, 5191) = 153.55, p < .001. No-
tably, at high levels of loneliness, low social support correlated with higher problem-gambling (DE
= -.005, LLCI/ULCI ̸= 0). These findings underscore the critical role of social support in miti-
gating problem-gambling among lonely individuals with depressive-vulnerability and offer potential
implications for intervention strategies.

1 Introduction
Problem-gambling, defined as the inability to control the time and money spent on gambling activities
(GRA, 2005), has significant consequences for individuals and society. In Australia, the financial impact
is staggering, with annual gambling losses projected to have reached $24 billion in 2021 (QGSO, 2023).
The repercussions also extend far beyond monetary losses, adversely affecting mental health, physical
well-being and financial stability at both individual and societal levels (Browne et al., 2017; Goodwin
et al., 2017; Hofmarcher et al., 2020). Furthermore, the consequences of problem-gambling are perhaps
particularly severe for those living in deprived areas, potentially exacerbating existing social inequalities
(Tu et al., 2014; Wardle et al., 2018). Given these far-reaching negative impacts, it is therefore important
to identify and understand the factors that contribute to the development and persistence of problem-
gambling behaviour.
Indeed, studies have identified strong correlations between problem-gambling and various individual
and social factors such as age, family cohesion and exposure to gambling (Shead et al., 2010; Welte
et al., 2006, 2007). However, one of the most striking observations in the literature has been the notable
gender gap: men are more likely to gamble frequently and experience problem-gambling at higher rates
(Carneiro et al., 2020). Approximately half of all Australian men gamble at least weekly (AIHW, 2023),
spending on average, 22% more than women per gambling session (Tajin et al., 2022).
Perhaps unsurprisingly, men also face a higher risk of developing gambling problems and experienc-
ing associated harm (AGRC, 2023; Tajin et al., 2022). Demographically, men with problem-gambling
tend to experience lower socioeconomic status, poorer psychosocial functioning and are less likely to
have close personal relationships (Carneiro et al., 2020; Hing et al., 2015). Given the disproportionate
impact of problem-gambling on men, this paper will focus specifically on several theoretically plausible
determinants of male gambling behaviour.
1.1 Theories of gambling
The theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen, 2002) provides a social cognitive perspective into problem-
gambling, suggesting gambling intentions may be influenced by personal attitudes, perceived societal
judgments, but also ease of access to gambling options (St-Pierre et al., 2015). Importantly, this theory
has been supported empirically, with studies consistently demonstrating a strong link between gambling
beliefs and behaviour (Martin et al., 2010; St-Pierre et al., 2015; Thomas et al., 2017).
However, one limitation of this theory has been the failure to properly account for the likely emotional
motivations often associated with alleviating negative mood states. In this regard, the revised pathway
model of problem-gambling (PMPG) which identifies an emotional-vulnerability pathway (Nower et al.,
2022) presents an opportunity to address the affective component to problem-gambling that has remained
largely outside the scope of the theory of planned behaviour. Notably, this pathway suggests that indi-
viduals with high depressive-vulnerability, defined as the propensity to develop depression (Kujawa and
Burkhouse, 2017), are more likely to engage in gambling behaviour as a means to find temporary relief
from negative emotions (Vaughan and Flack, 2022; Weatherly and Cookman, 2014).
1.2 Depressive-vulnerability and problem-gambling
Depressive-vulnerability is a complex trait that can significantly impact a person’s perception and inter-
action with their environment (Remes et al., 2021). Vulnerable individuals tend to focus on negative in-
formation while struggling to engage with positive stimuli (Pe et al., 2013; Watson and Naragon-Gainey,
2010). This may lead to negative outcomes, including externalising problems (Oliffe et al., 2019), but
also the persistence of negative moods and depressive states (Clasen et al., 2013). Consequently, individ-
uals may turn to gambling as a maladaptive coping mechanism. Indeed, research has demonstrated a pos-
itive link between depressive-vulnerability and problem-gambling across various populations, including
youths, problem gamblers, and the general public (Barrault et al., 2019; Quigley et al., 2015; Vaughan
and Flack, 2022). Most notably, some studies have even suggested that prior depressive-vulnerability
may influence subsequent gambling participation (Jun et al., 2019), though the specific mechanisms
underlying this relationship – including whether and how social factors may interact with depressive-
vulnerability in contributing toward problem-gambling, a central focus of this investigation – remain
contended.
Inevitably, the relationship between problem-gambling and depressive-vulnerability remains com-
plex, including the possibility of reverse causality. For instance, given that incurring significant financial
losses may lead some people to become depressed (Allami et al., 2021), some studies have suggested
that problem-gambling may precede depressive symptoms (Langhinrichsen-Rohling et al., 2004). Stud-
ies have also found that individuals with gambling problems tend to have significantly higher rates of
depression compared to the general population, with depression being a common co-occurring disorder
among treatment-seeking problem gamblers (Richard et al., 2020).
This complexity is perhaps further compounded by the possibility of a mixed model, where develop-
mental factors are suggested to contribute to both problem-gambling and depressive symptoms, creating
a mutually reinforcing feedback loop (i.e., bidirectionality) over time (Dussault et al., 2011). In this con-
text, understanding the factors motivating problem-gambling behaviours may therefore also be crucial
for improving mental health outcomes.
Taken together, these findings complicate understanding of how individuals with higher depressive-
vulnerability might be more predisposed to engage in problem-gambling behaviours. However, given
the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for gambling disorder includes ‘gambling when feeling depressed’ (APA,
2013), this study will focus on exploring the influence of depressive-vulnerability on gambling be-
haviours, particularly among men.
1.3 Loneliness: An emotional perception of isolation
Loneliness, defined as the subjective emotional perception of isolation and deficiency in social relation-
ships (Tiwari, 2013), may not only be another significant factor driving problem-gambling among men
but may perhaps also be intimately linked to their depressive-vulnerability. Research has suggested that
loneliness may be affected by various psychosocial factors (Hutten et al., 2022) and is robustly associated
with poorer mental health outcomes and overall well-being (Park et al., 2020). Notably, this association
has been found to be particularly pronounced in men, where loneliness has been linked to an increased
risk of mood disorders and suicidal ideation (Ernst et al., 2021; Steen et al., 2022).
Recently, evidence has also emerged in support of an effect of depressive-vulnerability on loneli-
ness (Erzen and C¸ ikrikci, 2018). A meta-analysis of young adults by Achterbergh et al. (2020) found
a positive relationship between loneliness and depressive-vulnerability, which may perpetuate into a vi-
cious downward spiral if left undisclosed. Indeed, this would be consistent with Cacioppo et al. (2006)
who used longitudinal data to show a similar pattern that may ultimately result in diminished well-being
overall, particularly among middle-aged and older adults.
Turning to the relationship between loneliness and problem-gambling, an equally well-developed
line of research has emerged, revealing not only a positive correlation between these two variables but
potentially also a causal link (Karaıbrahımoglu et al., 2023; McQuade and Gill, 2012). Perhaps more
important, loneliness has been shown to increase the risk of greater gambling behaviour and gambling-
related problems in men (Sirola et al., 2019; Vuorinen et al., 2024). This association may have potentially
occurred as men experiencing negative emotions attempt to self-medicate through gambling, seeking
temporary relief that can lead to habitual gambling and impaired cognitive beliefs about gambling out-
comes (Blaszczynski and Nower, 2002; Murphy and Khantzian, 1995).
Finally, a smaller number of studies have also examined whether loneliness may mediate the ef-
fects of depressive-vulnerability on problem-gambling. For instance, Botterill et al. (2016) found that
loneliness mediated the relationship between marital status – particularly negative feelings associated
with being divorced, widowed or living alone – and problem-gambling; however, this was limited to just
older men. Thus, it remains to be determined if loneliness may possibly explain the connection between
depressive-vulnerability and problem-gambling more generally across men.
1.4 Social support
Social support, defined as the physical, psychological, and financial assistance available through social
interactions (Mishra, 2020), may also play a significant role in the relationship between depressive-
vulnerability and problem-gambling. For instance, research has consistently demonstrated an inverse
association between social support and multiple aspects of well-being, including physical, mental, and
financial health (Alsubaie et al., 2019; Aslund et al., 2014; Grey et al., 2020).
Of particular relevance to this study is the inverse relationship between social support and depression,
with evidence indicating that individuals experiencing depressive-vulnerability may withdraw from their
social networks (Rowland et al., 2023). Thus, just as loneliness may explain the emotional experience of
loneliness, social support could inform the social aspect. However, while studies have demonstrated that
higher levels of social support correlate negatively with loneliness across various populations (Mishra,
2020; Ozbay et al., 2007; Zhang and Dong, 2022), it is important to recognise that loneliness cannot
be fully attributed to the mere absence of social support (Chen et al., 2014; Penfold and Ogden, 2024),
underscoring the need to consider these two distinct constructs jointly.
In the context of problem-gambling, the role of social support appears to be nuanced and at times
even contradictory. For example, several studies have suggested a negative relationship between social
support and problem-gambling, with lower social support linked to increased gambling severity among
pathological gamblers and adolescents (Petry and Weiss, 2009; Ra¨sa¨nen et al., 2016). Furthermore,
strong social support has also been suggested to act as a protective factor against problem-gambling
(Nordmyr et al., 2016; Oksanen et al., 2021).
On the other hand, some research has found that greater social support may be associated with in-
creased gambling, particularly in older adults (Parke et al., 2018). This paradoxical effect may be at-
tributed to the use of gambling networks for social interactions, thereby providing more opportunities
for gambling activities (Bilt et al., 2004; Sirola et al., 2019). Perhaps further complicating the direction
of this relationship are the types and sources of social support, which have been shown to differently in-
fluence gambling behaviour. For instance, while access to online gambling communities may exacerbate
gambling behaviour (Sirola et al., 2019), interactions with friends and family may serve to reduce it (Bilt
et al., 2004). This distinction highlights the importance of considering the nature and context of social
support when examining its effects on problem-gambling.
Finally, while the empirical evidence is currently limited, there are compelling reasons to suspect
that social support may moderate the relationships between loneliness, depressive-vulnerability, and
problem-gambling. For example, research has shown that social support can weaken the association
between loneliness and depressive-vulnerability (Liu et al., 2016), potentially due to the smaller so-
cial networks accessible to individuals experiencing loneliness. This moderation effect could, in turn,
influence gambling behaviour. Naturally, social support may also have a direct moderating effect on
depressive-vulnerability and problem-gambling. However, whether and if so how such factors may in-
deed interact with one another in shaping problem-gambling behaviours has received less attention and
remains to be determined, particularly among men. Ultimately, understanding why some individuals
successfully manage their gambling resources while others struggle is essential for developing more
effective prevention and intervention strategies.
1.5 Advancing knowledge in male problem-gambling
Although prior research has suggested depressive-vulnerability, loneliness, and social support as poten-
tially important determinants of problem-gambling, limitations of these studies exist. Most importantly,
prior research has not investigated all these factors together, especially when attempting to explain gam-
bling behaviour. Given that depressive-vulnerability, loneliness, and social support have been linked to
one another (Tibubos et al., 2019), the suggested effects of each of these constructs on problem-gambling
may not be unique (i.e., they may be due to one of the other constructs). For example, the relatively high
depressive-vulnerability found in most problem gamblers (Hodgins et al., 2012) may be partly, or even
entirely, due to stronger feelings of loneliness, resulting in using gambling – and particularly gambling-
communities – for social networking and to find similar peers.
Likewise, it is possible that the associated effects of depressive-vulnerability and/or loneliness on
gambling behaviour may emerge (or vanish), depending on one’s access to social support from family,
friends, and others. Thus, it would be useful to capture these constructs jointly, to not only estimate the
unique effects that each depressive-vulnerability and/or loneliness may have on problem-gambling, but
also whether these effects may be strengthened (or weakened) by the level of social support available.
In addition to the issue of investigating the above proposed determinants of gambling behaviour sepa-
rately, external validity of the main relationships between these constructs remains a key concern. While
most studies have focused on clinical settings with patients already admitted for a problem-gambling
disorder (Barrault et al., 2019; Becon˜a et al., 1996; Rizeanu, 2013), less is known regarding whether
depression-vulnerability, loneliness, and/or social support may predict gambling behaviour more gener-
ally. This remains true even among the few studies which have been able to investigate the proposed
relationships outside of a clinical setting, as they have typically had to rely on convenience samples
of high school and/or university students (Richard et al., 2020) – where gambling behaviour, or a lack
thereof, may be influenced by factors other than the ones proposed (such as low or no income). Thus, a
key purpose of this study is to examine the variables of interest in a more representative sample, while
also being able to control for a rich set of covariates that may independently influence problem-gambling.
Finally, and closely related to the above limitation, of the studies that have been able to identify
a significant association between problem-gambling and one (or more) of the proposed determinants
(i.e., depressive-vulnerability, loneliness, and social support), the vast majority have come from cross-
sectional research designs (Botterill et al., 2016; Flack and Stevens, 2019; Rizeanu, 2013; Vaughan and
Flack, 2022). Unsurprisingly, less evidence exists longitudinally (with the notable exceptions of Dussault
et al., 2011 and Vuorinen et al., 2024). In fact, no research has yet investigated the hypothesised associa-
tions between depressive-vulnerability, loneliness, social support, and problem-gambling (as depicted in
vulnerability, problem-gambling, loneliness and social support.

1.6 Summary and purpose
To date, no study has examined depression-vulnerability, loneliness, and social support jointly when try-
ing to predict problem-gambling in a male population using national-level longitudinal data. Moreover,
limitations exist in the current literature on gambling behaviour – particularly, in the context of gener-
alisability of the associated effects, as most prior studies have had to rely on convenience samples (i.e.,
students) or smaller clinical ones. Similarly, research has also been largely confined to cross-sectional
investigations, with less known about problem-gambling and its possible determinants longitudinally.
Perhaps most important, as depression-vulnerability, loneliness, and social support are interrelated
constructs, it is necessary to account for their shared and unique effects when predicting problem-
gambling behaviour. Furthermore, as loneliness may be influenced by depressive-vulnerability (Achter-
bergh et al., 2020), it remains important to also investigate loneliness as a potential mediator between
Likewise, given that both depressive-vulnerability and loneliness may, in part, be influenced by one’s
access to social support (Wang et al., 2018), it is also necessary to investigate whether having social
support can moderate the link between depressive-vulnerability, loneliness, and problem-gambling. Ul-
timately, the presence of any significant associations between these variables will provide deeper insights
into how and why depression-vulnerability, loneliness, and/or social support are related to gambling be-
haviour.
Consequently, the first aim of this study is to examine the associations between depressive-vulnerability,
loneliness, social support, and problem-gambling in a representative sample of Australian men. The sec-
ond aim of this study is then to examine whether loneliness mediates the relationship between depressive-
vulnerability and problem-gambling and whether social support moderates this mediating effect.
1.7 Hypotheses and research questions
Relating specifically to men, and controlling for the effects of several covariates (i.e., gambling fre-
quency, age, marital status, income, employment, education, and caregiver status), the following hy-
potheses are proposed:
Hypothesis 1 (H ). Depressive-vulnerability will associate positively with problem-gambling.
Hypothesis 2 (H ). Depressive-vulnerability will associate positively with loneliness.
Hypothesis 3 (H ). Depressive-vulnerability will associate negatively with social support.
Hypothesis 4 (H ). Loneliness will associate negatively with social support.
Hypothesis 5 (H ). Loneliness will associate positively with problem-gambling.
Hypothesis 6 (H ). Social support will associate negatively with problem-gambling.
Furthermore, the following research question is asked:
Research Question 1 (RQ ). Can social support explain the relationship between depressive-vulnerability,
loneliness, and problem-gambling in adult males?
2 Method
2.1 Participants
The data used in this paper came from Ten to Men: The Australian Longitudinal Study on Male Health
(hereafter TTM), an ongoing nationally representative cohort study of Australian males aged 10 years and
older coordinated by the Australian Institute of Family Studies (Pirkis et al., 2016). Since its inception in
2012, participants have been recruited into successive survey waves conducted approximately every 2-3
years – Wave 2 (2015), Wave 3 (2020) and Wave 4 (2022). Overall, around 7,000 participants remain as
active respondents in Wave 4 of the study, the latest available wave at the time of writing.
For the analysis, all observations with available information on the primary variables of interest
(described in detail below) were included. In total, this produced a main sample of 5,204 participants
(M = 44.25; SD = 12.08) observed across Waves 3 and 4. Ethics approval for TTM was granted by the
Australian Institute of Family Studies Ethics Committee, which is registered with the National Health
and Medical Research Council (AIFS, 2024).
2.2 Measures
2.2.1 Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI)
To assess gambling behaviour, responses to the PGSI were used, a nine-item self-report measure intro-
duced in Wave 3 to address gaps in the literature associated with gambling participation (Tajin et al.,
2022). Participants are asked to indicate on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Never) to 3 (Almost
always) how well each item describes their gambling behaviour over the past 12 months. An example
item includes ‘Have you bet more than you could really afford to lose?’ Responses to the items are
then summed to provide a final PGSI score ranging between 0 and 27, with higher values indicating
greater problem-gambling severity. The PGSI score can also be classified into four clinical categories:
Non-problem gambler (0), low-risk gambler (1–2), moderate-risk gambler (3–7), and problem gambler
(8 or above). For this study, PGSI scores from Wave 4 were used for analysis. Notably, the PGSI has
demonstrated high internal reliability (α = .89) and good discriminant and predictive validity (Loo et al.,
2011; Merkouris et al., 2020). In this sample, the internal consistency of this measure was associated
with a McDonald’s omega (ω) of .91.
2.2.2 Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)
Information about participants’ depressive-vulnerability was captured by the PHQ-9, a nine-item self-
report measure of depressive symptoms over the last 2 weeks (Kroenke et al., 2001). Example items
include ‘Little interest or pleasure in doing things’ and ‘Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless’, with
responses recorded on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Nearly every day). Once
summed, total scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater depressive-vulnerability.
The PHQ-9 categorises into four levels: no or minimal depression (0–4), mild depression (5–9), moderate
depression (10–14) and severe depression (15–21).
For the analysis, scores from Wave 3 were utilised. Importantly, the PHQ-9 has demonstrated excel-
lent reliability, with strong correlations to other depression and depressive symptom measures (Dadfar
et al., 2018; Kroenke et al., 2001) and high sensitivity and specificity for detecting major depression
(Billy and Yee, 2018). Likewise, the PHQ-9 has exhibited high internal consistency (α = .84) among
non-clinical populations (Thibodeau and Asmundson, 2014), including in the present sample (ω = .90).
2.2.3 UCLA loneliness scale – short form (UCLA)
Introduced in Wave 3 to examine the impact of loneliness among Australian men (Terhaag et al., 2020),
the UCLA consists of four self-report items designed to measure a respondent’s subjective feelings of
loneliness (Russell et al., 1980). Participants rate statements such as ‘Currently, how often did you feel
that you lack companionship?’ on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Never) to 5 (Always). The
four items are then added up to produce a total score ranging between 4 and 20, with higher scores
indicating greater loneliness. For the study, UCLA scores from Wave 3 were used. The UCLA has
demonstrated high internal consistency (α = .75) and strong correlation (r = .88) with the original 20-
item UCLA Loneliness Scale (Hays and DiMatteo, 1987). In the present sample, the internal consistency
was excellent (ω = .91).
2.2.4 Medical Outcome Studies (MOS) emotional/informational support subscale
Finally, to measure perceived social support, the emotional and informational support subscale of the
MOS was used (Sherbourne and Stewart, 1991). Notably, this eight-item subscale assesses the avail-
ability of different types of support, such as having ‘someone who understands your problem’. Par-
ticipants rate each item on a five-point Likert scale from 1 (None of the time) to 5 (All of the time),
indicating how often each type of support is available if needed. Item responses are then summed and
transformed to a 0–100 scale, with higher values indicating greater perceived social support. The MOS
emotional/informational support subscale has demonstrated good construct validity and reliability (Gi-
angrasso and Casale, 2014). Similarly, in this sample, the subscale showed excellent internal consistency
(ω = .98).
2.2.5 Control and demographic variables
In addition to the four main variables of interest, several demographic and control variables from Wave
3 were included in the analysis.
Gambling frequency. This was assessed through a 10-item self-report measure regarding how often
participants engaged in various gambling activities (such as ‘Bingo’) over the past 12 months. Rated on
a six-point scale from 1 (Never) to 6 (More than once per week), responses are averaged to produce a
single gambling frequency score.
Age. Participants provided their date of birth, which was used to calculate their age based on when
they completed the survey.
Marital status. Participants indicated their current relationship status, which was categorised into
two groups: those who were in a relationship at the time of the survey (i.e., married, in a relationship, liv-
ing with a partner, or engaged) and those who were not in a relationship (i.e., divorced, single, separated,
or widowed).
Income. Information on household income was collected based on participants’ selection from 14
available categories ranging between ‘negative income’ and ‘$200,000 or more per year’. For the anal-
ysis, income is categorised as “High” for those earning $80,000 or more per year and “Low” for those
earning less than $80,000.
Employment. Participants reported their employment status, which was grouped for the analysis
into “Employed” (i.e., full-time employees, part-time employees, self-employed individuals, and unpaid
family business workers) and “Not Employed” (i.e., those seeking or not seeking employment).
Education. Participants indicated their highest level of educational qualification, which was divided
into “High” (i.e., postgraduate degrees, graduate diplomas/certificates, bachelor’s degrees, and advanced
diplomas/diplomas) and “Low” (i.e., Certificate III/IV, Certificate I/II, and other non-school qualifica-
tions).
Caregiver status. Information on the caregiver status, including biological, step, and adopted chil-
dren, was also collected. For the analysis, participants were categorised into two groups: those with one
or more children, and those with no children.
2.3 Procedure
Administered primarily online, each wave of TTM consisted of participants responding to questionnaires
covering various aspects of health, including physical and mental health, well-being, social determi-
nants of health, health-related behaviours, health service utilisation, and health knowledge (for a detailed
overview of TTM and its methodology, see Pirkis et al., 2016). While the core content has remained
consistent across survey waves, some measures, including problem-gambling and loneliness, were only
introduced in later waves. In particular, these measures (PGSI and UCLA) were first included in Wave
3 (2020, n = 7,415) and subsequently in Wave 4 (2022, n = 6,154), thereby restricting the analysis to
these two waves where full information for the four main variables of interest were available.
To investigate whether depressive-vulnerability, loneliness, and social support predict problem-gambling,
the longitudinal nature of the TTM study was utilised. Specifically, data for most variables of interest
were drawn from Wave 3, except for problem-gambling data, which were obtained from Wave 4. Af-
ter restricting the sample to those who completed all variables (of interest) across both waves, the final
analytic sample consisted of 5,204 participants.
2.4 Statistical analyses
All analyses were conducted in IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0. Pearson correlation coefficients were
calculated to examine the relationships among all variables. The proposed moderated mediation model
was then tested using Hayes’ PROCESS macro (Model 59) for SPSS. This model assumes that social
support acts as a moderator, potentially influencing all pathways within the mediation framework (Hayes,
2013), including the direct and indirect relationships between depressive-vulnerability, loneliness, and
Bootstrapping analysis was performed with 10,000 samples, and an alpha of .05, to calculate 95%
bias-corrected confidence intervals (Hayes, 2015). The significance of the moderated mediation model
was assessed through an indexed moderated mediation. Additionally, individual regression coefficients
were examined along with their 95% confidence intervals to evaluate the predictive utility of each vari-
able. Statistical significance was determined when the lower and upper limit confidence intervals did not
include zero (LLCI/ULCI ̸= 0).
To further explore how different levels of social support might influence the relationships among
the variables of interest, social support was categorised into high and low groups based on one standard
deviation above and below the mean. Simple slopes were then plotted to visualise these effects. Finally,
the significance level for all analyses was set at α = .05.
3 Results
Notice that all data are from Wave 3, except for problem-gambling measures, which are derived from
Wave 4. Problem-gambling is represented in two forms: the standard PGSI score and an inverse-scored
the full sample analysis are marital status, income, employment status, and education level.

3.1 Statistical assumptions
Before conducting the analyses, the data were screened for outliers and missing values. A standard
multiple regression analysis was then performed to estimate the proportion of variance in depressive-
vulnerability and problem-gambling that could be accounted for by loneliness and social support. Prior
to interpreting the results, several assumptions were also evaluated. First, an inspection of the scatterplot
of standardised residuals against standardised predicted values indicated a non-normal relationship. All
Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) were below 5.00, suggesting no multicollinearity among the predictor
variables.
Next, normality was assessed using skewness and kurtosis, using statistical guidelines for sam-
ples greater than 300, with skewness values exceeding |2| and kurtosis values exceeding |7| indicate
non-normality (Kim, 2013). All predictor variables fell within acceptable ranges, except for problem-
gambling.
Additionally, Mahalanobis distance exceeded the critical χ value for df = 3 (α = .001) of 16.27,
indicating the presence of one or more multivariate outliers. However, Cook’s distance for all cases was
< 1.00, suggesting no influential outliers. This is as expected given the low likelihood of experiencing
problem-gambling and depressive-vulnerability in the general population.
To address the non-normality of problem-gambling scores, an inverse transformation (1/x) was ap-
plied to improve normality (Osborne, 2002). Thus, for the analysis, problem-gambling was considered
in its inverse transformation context, specifically as inversely scored problem-gambling levels. Finally, a
priori power analysis indicated that the sample size (n = 5,204) exceeded the minimum required sample
size of 415 participants to detect a small effect size at the conventional alpha level of .05 and a power
level of .80.
3.2 Correlational analysis
(gambling frequency, age, marital status, income, employment, education, and caregiver status). The
analysis supported all hypotheses:
(H ). A significant small negative relationship was found between depressive-vulnerability and
problem-gambling (r = −.09, p < .001). Given the inverse transformation of problem-gambling,
this indicates a significant positive relationship between depressive-vulnerability and problem-gambling,
supporting the first hypothesis.
(H ). A significant large positive relationship was observed between depressive-vulnerability and
loneliness (r = .56, p < .001), supporting the second hypothesis.
(H ). A significant moderate negative relationship was found between depressive-vulnerability and
social support (r = −.32, p < .001), supporting the third hypothesis.
(H ). A significant moderate negative relationship was observed between loneliness and social sup-
port (r = −.42, p < .001), suggesting these constructs are related but distinct, thus supporting the fourth
hypothesis.
(H ). A significant small negative relationship was found between loneliness and problem-gambling
(r = −.08, p < .001). Accounting for the inverse transformation, this indicates a significant positive re-
lationship between loneliness and problem-gambling, supporting the fifth hypothesis.

Notes: n = 5,204. All data are from Wave 3, except for problem-gambling (inversely scored problem-gambling) which comes from
Wave 4. Several variables are dichotomously coded: Marital status (in or not in a relationship); Income (above or below $80,000 per
year); Employment (employed or unemployed); Education (above or below bachelor’s degree); Caregiver status (child or childless).

Finally, several control variables, particularly age and marital status, also showed significant correla-
tions with other outcome variables.

interaction between depressive-vulnerability and social support in predicting loneliness, a (β = .000,
3i
LLCI/ULCI = 0). Overall, these results suggest that while both depressive-vulnerability and social sup-
port independently influence loneliness, their interaction does not have a significant effect. Therefore, a
moderated a path was not observed in this model.
3.3.2 Social support
The full mediated-moderation model, incorporating social support, depressive vulnerability, loneliness,
∧ 2
and the covariates, accounted for a significant 26.2% of the variability in problem-gambling (R =
.262, F (12, 5,191) = 153.55, p < .001). According to Cohen’s (2016) conventions, a combined effect of
this magnitude can be considered large.
′ ′
The c path. The analysis examined the c path to determine whether social support moderated the
relationships among variables in the hypothesised moderated-mediation model. Specifically, this path
was investigated to assess if depressive-vulnerability directly predicted problem-gambling . The results
revealed a small but statistically significant negative relationship between problem-gambling and the
interaction of depressive-vulnerability and social support, c (β = −.000, LLCI/ULCI ̸= 0). While the
effect size was minimal, this finding suggests a moderated direct pathway in explaining the relationship
between depressive-vulnerability and problem-gambling .
However, no statistically significant relationships were found for the direct path between depressive-
∧ ′
vulnerability and problem-gambling (c ), or between loneliness and the interaction of depressive-
vulnerability and social support (c ). Despite these non-significant individual pathways, the overall
′ 2
results indicate a statistically significant moderated c path, although the effect size was small (∆R =
.001, F (1, 5,191) = 7.27, p < .05). This suggests that social support does play a role in moderating the
relationship between depressive-vulnerability and problem-gambling, albeit a subtle one.
The b path. In the b path, a small but statistically significant positive relationship was observed
2i
between the interaction of loneliness and social support, and problem-gambling (β = .000, LLCI/ULCI
̸= 0). Despite the small effect size, this finding indicates a significant moderated indirect pathway in
explaining the relationship between depressive-vulnerability and problem-gambling . Conversely, no
statistically significant relationship was found between loneliness and problem-gambling in the b
1i
path.
However, when considering the overall moderated b path, the results suggest no statistically signif-
icant indirect effect (∆R = .000, F (1, 5,191) = 3.17, p = .07). This indicates that while there is a
significant interaction effect, the overall moderation of the b path does not reach statistical significance.
Overall, the analysis revealed a moderated effect in both the b and c pathways, indicating that social
support plays a moderating role in predicting problem-gambling through two interaction paths: the in-
teraction between depressive-vulnerability and loneliness, as well as the interaction between loneliness
and social support. In addressing RQ , the findings suggest that the mediating role of loneliness in
the relationship between depressive-vulnerability and problem-gambling is specifically moderated by
social support. This moderated mediation effect offers a more nuanced understanding of how these vari-
within the model.

However, at high levels of depressive-vulnerability, higher social support did not significantly change
the level of problem-gambling . This pattern suggests that the moderating effect of social support on
the relationship between depressive-vulnerability and problem-gambling is more pronounced when
depressive-vulnerability is low. Conversely, when depressive-vulnerability is high, the protective effect
of social support appears to diminish.
Finally, the omnibus test of conditional direct effect (DE) indicates that social support significantly
moderated the DE of loneliness on problem-gambling . The DE was significant across all levels of social
support: high (DE = −.005, 95% CI [−.006, −.003]), average (DE = −.003, 95% CI [−.004, −.002]),
and low (DE = −.001, 95% CI [−.003, −.000]). However, the omnibus test of conditional indirect
effect (IE) suggests that social support did not significantly moderate the IE of loneliness on problem-
gambling . The IE was not statistically significant across any level of social support: high (IE = .000,
95% CI [−.001, .001]), average (IE = −.000, 95% CI [−.001, .000]), or low (IE = −.001, 95% CI
[−.000, .000]). Overall, these results indicate that while social support influences the direct relationship
between loneliness and problem-gambling , its moderating effect on the indirect pathway through other
variables is not statistically significant.
3.3.3 Post hoc analysis
Given the low levels of depressive-vulnerability and problem-gambling in the sample (i.e., general pop-
ulation), a post-hoc comparison using a chi-square test for goodness of fitness (with α = .05) was con-
ducted to assess whether depressive-vulnerability was associated with problem-gambling when control-
(9, n = 5,131) = 66.41, p < .001. This indicates that when scored using clinical cut-offs, depressive-
vulnerability levels were reported at significantly different frequencies across problem-gambling severity
levels, which were also scored according to clinical criteria. As an index of effect size, Cohen’s w was
calculated to be 0.11, which can be considered small according to Cohen’s (2013) conventions.
To identify patterns of representation among depressive-vulnerable individuals across problem-gambling
severity categories, standardised residuals were also analysed. Residuals exceeding |2| signify a signifi-
depressive-vulnerability and problem-gambling; individuals with no or minimal depressive-vulnerability
were significantly underrepresented in both moderate (−2.3) and high problem-gambling (−3.1) cate-
gories. In contrast, those experiencing moderate (2.7) and severe (5) depressive-vulnerability showed
sentation of these findings, emphasising the disproportionate distribution of individuals across various
clinical levels of depressive-vulnerability and problem-gambling severity. Overall, this analysis reveals

4 Discussion
Given the significant negative outcomes associated with problem-gambling, particularly among men, it is
important to understand the factors that contribute to this behaviour. Previous research has indicated that
depressive-vulnerability, loneliness, and social support may be linked to problem-gambling. Moreover,
and according to PMGM, these factors may also predict future gambling behaviour (Blaszczynski and
Nower, 2002). Therefore, the current study aimed to examine the associations between these variables
specifically in men.
Perhaps most importantly, the study aimed to investigate a moderated-mediation model exploring
how social support and loneliness interact to explain the relationship between depressive-vulnerability
and problem-gambling. Of particular interest was whether limited access to social support would strengthen
the associations among depressive-vulnerability, loneliness, and problem-gambling. The following sec-
tion will discuss the results and their implications, before concluding with directions for future research.
4.1 Correlational relationships (H – H )
1 6
First, small negative correlations were found between problem-gambling and both depressive-vulnerability
(r = −.09) and loneliness (r = −.08). When accounting for the inverse transformation of problem-
gambling, these results suggest small positive relationships between problem-gambling and both depressive-
vulnerability and loneliness, in support of H and H , and consistent in magnitude and direction with
1 5
prior studies (Jun et al., 2019; Karaıbrahımoglu et al., 2023). Given that depressive-vulnerability and
loneliness were measured in Wave 3, while problem-gambling was assessed in Wave 4, these results
suggest that these psychological factors may also predict future problem-gambling behaviour.
Next, the correlation between social support and problem-gambling was small and positive (r =
.06). When adjusted for inverse transformation, this indicates a small negative relationship between
social support and problem-gambling, in support of H . This finding also supports previous literature
suggesting that increased social support reduces problem-gambling (Ra¨sa¨nen et al., 2016), yet contrasts
with findings in older adults (Bilt et al., 2004), possibly due to differing motivations for gambling across
age groups. For instance, while older adults may use gambling as a socialisation opportunity (Parke
et al., 2018), others generally gamble to alleviate negative affect (Mohr et al., 2004). Thus, as social
support increases, the need to pursue gambling may diminish (Velotti et al., 2021). Further studies are
needed to examine this relationship in detail.
In support of H and H , meaningful relationships were also found between depressive-vulnerability
2 3
and both loneliness (r = .56) and social support (r = −.32). These findings align with previous studies
showing positive correlations between loneliness and depressive-vulnerability (Karaıbrahımoglu et al.,
2023) and negative correlations between social support and depressive-vulnerability (Grey et al., 2020).
However, the directionality of these relationships remains unclear with data from only two timepoints and
therefore requires further investigation. In particular, studies on loneliness have found both preceding and
causal relationships with depressive-vulnerability (Erzen and C¸ ikrikci, 2018; Qualter et al., 2010). Sim-
ilarly, while limited social support may increase depressive-vulnerability (Beedie and Kennedy, 2002),
other studies suggest that depressive-vulnerability might cause individuals to withdraw socially (Row-
land et al., 2023). Additional research is therefore needed to determine the precise causal relationships
between the factors.
Finally, in support of H , a moderate negative correlation was found between social support and
loneliness (r = −.42), suggesting a strong but imperfect inverse relationship between these constructs.
While this finding aligns with prior studies in effect and direction (Machado et al., 2023), research
indicates that the source of social support (e.g., family, friends, or partners) may differentially affect
loneliness (Lee and Goldstein, 2016). As the current study did not distinguish between these sources,
future research is needed to investigate how this may influence the link between social support and
loneliness.
4.2 Moderated-mediation model RQ
In response to RQ , the study found that social support moderated the mediating role of loneliness
in the relationship between depressive-vulnerability and problem-gambling. The c path revealed a
small but significant negative effect in the moderated-mediated direct pathway between the interaction of
depressive-vulnerability and social support. Furthermore, a simple slopes analysis of low and high social
support in this moderated c path indicated that social support had a larger impact on problem-gambling,
specifically for individuals with low depressive-vulnerability. Theoretically, these findings align with
previous research showing that social support can alleviate the risk for depressive-vulnerability during the
COVID-19 pandemic (Grey et al., 2020). However, the results also suggest a more complex relationship.
For example, men with high depressive-vulnerability may be less likely to seek help (Sagar-Ouriaghli
et al., 2019), potentially diminishing the protective effect of social support. Alternatively, individuals
with high depressive-vulnerability may perceive less benefit from their social support during this period
(Mitchell et al., 2022), possibly due to the unique stressors associated with the pandemic. Future studies
are needed to explore these possibilities.
The b path showed a small positive significant indirect effect in the interacted loneliness and so-
2i
cial support moderated-mediation pathway. This suggests that increasing social support would decrease
the impact of loneliness on problem-gambling in individuals with depressive-vulnerability. Indeed, a
simple plot for the moderated b path, with social support divided into high and low groups, indicated
that low levels of social support reduced problem-gambling in individuals with high levels of loneli-
ness. This positive relationship aligns with prior studies identifying social support as a protective factor
against problem-gambling, particularly for individuals experiencing high levels of loneliness (Oksanen
et al., 2021). Consistent with PMPG (Blaszczynski and Nower, 2002), as increased social support may
reduce negative mood experiences in individuals with depressive-vulnerability experiencing loneliness,
this reduces the need for an emotional outlet through gambling (Velotti et al., 2021).
Finally, the analysis found no significant interaction effect between depressive-vulnerability and so-
cial support on loneliness, i.e., the a path (a ). This unexpected result may have several potential
3i
explanations, such as a higher baseline level of social support in the study population (Aguocha and
Uwakwe, 2023) or other unmeasured factors influencing the relationship (e.g., less likely to seek support
due to masculinity norms conformity; Courtenay, 2000). This would be consistent with the observation
that while men gamble more frequently and experience problem-gambling at higher rates, they are less
inclined to seek help for their depressive symptoms and problem-gambling (Flack and Stevens, 2019;
Husky et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2016). However, further research is needed to understand the precise
mechanisms at play and to verify these hypotheses.
4.3 Clinical cohort (post hoc)
As might be expected, the post hoc analysis revealed an underrepresentation of individuals with clin-
ical levels of problem-gambling and depressive-vulnerability in this study’s representative sample of
Australian men. Importantly, this restricted range may explain the small effect sizes observed in the
moderated-mediation pathway results. However, despite their modest size, these effects may still carry
meaningful implications from an aggregate perspective.
For an individual with depressive-vulnerabilities, the small effect size may compound due to accu-
mulation over time and thus increase the impact (Anvari et al., 2023). Furthermore, when applied to a
larger population, the absolute number may vary depending on population size (Carey et al., 2023). Such
an effect may be particularly relevant in the context of the recent pandemic, during which these psy-
chological and social factors were notably amplified. Also, given the fact that these factors (captured in
Wave 3) correspond to subsequent reported gambling behaviour (Wave 4), it is possible that widespread
problem-gambling may persist, at least over the near-term.
Nevertheless, future research should extend this model to clinical populations and conduct longitu-
dinal studies. These approaches could reveal stronger patterns of association in individuals with severe
depressive-vulnerability and problem-gambling and provide insights into how these factors interact over
time.
4.4 Limitations and future research directions
A key limitation of the present study is that a reversal in the directionality between the variables of
interest was not examined. Indeed, problem-gambling is often associated with negative outcomes such
as depression and social isolation (Fong, 2005), which in turn can also lead to loneliness (John et al.,
2019). This raises the possibility that the model may have confounded the cumulative impacts of past
gambling behaviour on future problem-gambling, especially given that repeated exposure to gambling
has been associated with distorted cognitions and condition behaviour, and subsequently perpetuates
gambling habits (Blaszczynski and Nower, 2002). Nevertheless, the significant relationship observed
after controlling for gambling frequency suggests that the proposed model explains some variance in
problem-gambling in men. Yet, while a causal relationship from depressive-vulnerability (in Wave 3) to
problem-gambling (in Wave 4) may be inferred, further investigation into the bi-directional nature of this
relationship is essential. Future studies utilising subsequent TTM waves (as they become available) may
help clarify directionality and identify potential causal relationships between these factors.
Another limitation involves the reliance on self-report measures, which may result in underreporting
of symptoms, particularly among men (Hunt et al., 2003). This concern is compounded by individual
differences in the perception of symptom severity, especially regarding depression in men (Papageor-
giou et al., 2015). To address these limitations, future research should consider incorporating objective
measures or ratings of distress and dysfunction to yield more accurate and comparable assessments of
symptoms (Solomon et al., 2015).
Finally, depressive-vulnerability frequently correlates with externalising behaviours such as sub-
stance abuse (Genuchi and Mitsunaga, 2015; Nordmyr et al., 2016). Future studies could therefore
explore potential parallels between such externalising behaviours and gambling in men with depressive-
vulnerability. This approach could provide a more comprehensive understanding of how various risky
behaviours may emerge and influence problem-gambling.
4.5 Implications
Previous research has identified positive associations between problem-gambling and both depressive-
vulnerability (Jun et al., 2019) and loneliness (Achterbergh et al., 2020), while social support has been
negatively associated with problem-gambling (Ra¨sa¨nen et al., 2016). However, this study’s unique con-
tribution lies in examining these factors jointly, revealing that social support moderates the mediated role
of loneliness in the relationship between depressive-vulnerability and problem-gambling. This observed
moderated-mediation model extends the conceptual knowledge of PMPG, highlighting the importance
of considering emotional and social factors collaboratively in understanding problem-gambling.
Clinically, these results suggest that screening for problem-gambling requires an empathic and non-
judgmental approach, actively looking for signs of depression, social isolation and poor relationships
(Carey et al., 2023). Additionally, clinicians should consider potential gender-specific manifestations
of depression in men when diagnosing for problem-gambling (Oliffe et al., 2019). Given that social
support is associated with fewer gambling problems and longer abstinence (Penfold and Ogden, 2024),
treatment for problem-gambling should consider extending social support, particularly for men with
high depressive-vulnerability and low levels of social support (Petry and Weiss, 2009). However, cau-
tion should be exercised when directing individuals to groups that may normalise gambling behaviour
(Russell et al., 2018), as this could inadvertently increase problem-gambling behaviour.
Finally, social support plays a crucial role in mitigating the effects of depression in lonely individuals
(Wang et al., 2018) and reducing negative outcomes such as suicidal ideation (Park et al., 2010). Building
on the national strategy’s recommendation to provide appropriate support for preventing gambling harm
(Parliament of Australia, 2023), local policies could focus on increasing awareness of available support
groups. These groups, such as MensLine, could offer both emotional support and assistance for problem-
gambling, potentially serving as a vital resource for men at risk.
4.6 Conclusion
This study suggests a positive association between social support and reduced problem-gambling among
men with depressive-vulnerability and loneliness. However, evidence for the efficacy of social support
in mitigating problem-gambling remains limited, necessitating further high-quality studies. While the
possibility exists that other factors may influence the relationship between depressive-vulnerability and
problem-gambling, the observed moderating effect of social support through the loneliness channel af-
firms the need to consider social and emotional factors in problem-gambling interventions.
