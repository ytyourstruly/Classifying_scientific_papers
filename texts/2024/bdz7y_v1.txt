Abstract
Corporate social responsibility plays a critical role in enhancing a company's reputation, building customer trust,
improving employee satisfaction, and contributing to sustainable development, all of which drive long-term
business success. Customer loyalty is equally crucial, as it fosters repeat business, strengthens brand reputation,
reduces marketing costs, and ensures long-term profitability and sustainable growth for a company. Service quality
enhances customer loyalty by providing a superior and consistent experience, which builds trust, satisfaction, and
emotional connection, encouraging customers to return and recommend the brand. This study explores the
mediating role of service quality in the relationship between corporate social responsibility and customer loyalty
within Nepalese commercial banks. A structured questionnaire was used to gather data from 397 customers across
various branches, employing a convenience sampling approach. The data were analyzed using Process Macro 4,
with a 95% confidence interval and 5,000 bootstrap samples. The results indicate that service quality fully mediates
the impact of CSR on customer loyalty, highlighting its critical role in fostering stronger customer relationships
in the banking sector. This study demonstrates that enhancing service quality can help foster customer loyalty
across various demographic groups. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of implementing CSR initiatives
that focus on improving service quality to develop greater customer loyalty towards the organization.

1. Introduction
Business operations significantly impact the external environment, societal structures, and consumer behavior,
shaping the interconnected dynamics of modern economies (Matten & Moon, 2020). In response to the challenges
posed by these influences, corporate social responsibility (CSR) has emerged as a proactive and strategic approach
to addressing the broader consequences of business activities. By prioritizing social, environmental, and ethical
considerations, CSR serves as a bridge between corporate objectives and societal well-being. It underscores the
importance of aligning corporate values with customer expectations and societal demands. As a continually
developing concept, CSR reflects the growing emphasis on sustainable practices and responsible business conduct,
reinforcing its relevance for both companies and stakeholders in an ever-changing global landscape (Herrmann et
al., 2017).

In recent times, corporate social responsibility has emerged as a powerful strategic tool for businesses, driving
profitability, enhancing customer loyalty, fostering client engagement, building credibility, and cultivating
positive brand perceptions (Calabrese et al., 2016). The growing demand among consumers for socially
responsible practices underscores its significance in today’s corporate landscape. Businesses are increasingly
recognizing the value of addressing social issues as part of their operations, not only to align with ethical standards
but also to strengthen trust and loyalty among their customers. By integrating CSR into their core strategies,
companies can transform social responsibility into a competitive advantage, fostering long-term relationships and
solidifying their position in the market. This shift highlights the evolving role of CSR as a cornerstone of modern
business practices, emphasizing its potential to bridge societal expectations with corporate success (Nyadzayo &
Khajehzadeh, 2016).
Customer loyalty is a key determinant of business sustainability, characterized by a customer's repeated
interactions, advocacy, and commitment to a brand despite competitive alternatives. It is built on the foundation
of satisfaction, trust, and positive customer experiences, which foster long-term emotional bonds (Oliver, 2019;
Reichheld & Sasser, 2020). Customer loyalty is increasingly driven by personalized experiences, rewards
programs, and enhanced emotional engagement, especially in competitive environments (Chaudhuri & Holbrook,
2021; Zeithaml et al., 2019). Loyal customers contribute to consistent sales through repeat purchases and are more
likely to advocate for the brand, generating organic referrals and positive word-of-mouth (Reichheld & Sasser,
2020). This advocacy not only attracts new customers but also strengthens the business's competitive positioning
in the market. Moreover, customer loyalty reduces marketing expenses, as retaining an existing customer costs
significantly less than acquiring a new one (Kotler & Keller, 2016). Businesses with strong customer loyalty also
benefit from customer feedback, which helps refine products and services, thereby driving innovation and
continuous improvement (Chaudhuri & Holbrook, 2021). In a digital era, loyalty programs and personalized
experiences have become instrumental in retaining customers, enabling businesses to gather valuable data and
deepen customer relationships (Upshot.ai, 2023; Comarch, 2023). This symbiotic relationship between customer
loyalty and business growth underscores its vital role in ensuring sustainable development.
Corporate Social Responsibility significantly impacts customer loyalty by fostering trust, emotional connection,
and brand advocacy. Companies that actively engage in CSR initiatives such as environmental sustainability,
ethical practices, and community development which demonstrate a commitment to values that resonate with
customers, enhancing their perception of the brand (Carroll & Shabana, 2010). CSR activities help build a positive
brand image, which strengthens emotional bonds with customers and drives repeat purchases (Lee et al., 2013). In
modern markets, where consumers are increasingly conscious of social and environmental issues, CSR has become
a competitive advantage. For instance, brands with well-executed CSR strategies report higher levels of customer
retention and advocacy compared to those without such initiatives (Martínez & del Bosque, 2013). This
underscores CSR's role not just as a moral obligation but as a strategic tool for building sustainable customer
loyalty.
CSR initiatives in Nepal are often hindered by limited resources, lack of regulatory enforcement, and insufficient
integration into core business strategies, which affects their impact on customer loyalty (Poudel & Sirohiya, 2021).
Despite these issues, businesses in sectors such as banking and tourism have started leveraging CSR to enhance
their reputations and build customer trust, which is vital for loyalty (Acharya & Paudel, 2020). Service quality
also plays a pivotal role in fostering customer loyalty, but Nepalese businesses often grapple with inconsistent
service standards due to inadequate training, outdated technology, and infrastructural limitations (Adhikari et al.,
2022). These issues are particularly pronounced in rural areas, where businesses struggle to meet customer
expectations. However, businesses that successfully combine CSR with improved service quality, such as by
aligning CSR efforts with community needs and customer expectations, have reported increased customer
satisfaction and loyalty (Shrestha & Bhandari, 2023). Economic instability, marked by dependence on remittances
and agriculture, further impacts businesses’ ability to invest in customer-oriented strategies and CSR activities
(World Bank, 2023). The slow adoption of technology and inadequate focus on sustainability exacerbate these
challenges, limiting Nepalese businesses' ability to compete in an increasingly globalized market (Acharya &
Paudel, 2020). In light of these issues, this study seeks to investigate the impact of corporate social responsibility
and customer loyalty in Nepalese commercial banks, specifically examining the mediating role of service quality.

2. Literature Review
Corporate social responsibility signifies an organization’s commitment to ethical practices, sustainable economic
development, and improving the well-being of employees, their families, communities, and society at large.
Schwartz and Carroll (2003) categorize CSR into four dimensions: legal, ethical, philanthropic, and economic
responsibilities. These dimensions outline a holistic approach to how businesses can align their goals with societal
expectations. Johnson (2011) offers another perspective, emphasizing that CSR involves implementing social
programs that ultimately contribute to long-term profit maximization. This viewpoint highlights how responsible
business practices can lead to sustainable profitability, aligning societal and corporate interests. Michael Hopkins
underscores the significance of CSR as a framework for ethical and responsible treatment of stakeholders, coupled
with a commitment to fostering economic progress. The World Council for Sustainable Development supports this
perspective, advocating for CSR as a driver of sustainable growth. Susanto (2009) expands on this by identifying
CSR as encompassing humanitarian efforts, adherence to legal frameworks, ethical conduct toward surrounding
communities, and contributions to economic education. Similarly, Schwartz and Carroll (2018) emphasized the
role of decision-makers in prioritizing public welfare and enhancing societal well-being through their actions. In
essence, CSR embodies a multidimensional approach where businesses balance profitability with their broader
societal responsibilities, ensuring the interests of all stakeholders are addressed ethically and sustainably.
Customer loyalty refers to a consumer's dedication to consistently engaging with a product, service, or brand, even
when faced with situational challenges or competing marketing efforts. Sangadji and Sopiah (2013) define it as a
commitment to future use, unaffected by external influences. Susanto (2009) views customer loyalty as a strong
positive attitude towards a brand or supplier, demonstrated through regular and repeated purchases. Hasan (2014)
describes it as the tendency of customers to return frequently to the same provider to meet their needs, indicating
a preference for specific products or services. Similarly, Kotler (2012) explains customer loyalty as a commitment
to chosen products or services, with a strong intention to repurchase, regardless of external factors. In essence,
customer loyalty combines emotional attachment and consistent behavior. It involves not only frequent and repeat
transactions but also a positive and enduring attitude toward the company or brand. This loyalty fosters a deeper
relationship between the customer and the provider, shaping purchasing decisions and driving long-term
engagement. Ailawadi et al. (2014) found that customers’ favorable perceptions of corporate social responsibility
initiatives by retail sellers significantly enhance customer loyalty.
Martinez and Rodriguez del Bosque (2013) similarly provided empirical evidence of a strong connection between
CSR and customer loyalty within the hotel industry. Perez and Bosque (2015) demonstrated that CSR positively
influences client loyalty in the banking sector, while Kang and Hustvedt (2014) highlighted a positive association
between CSR and repurchasing behavior among customers. Castaldo et al. (2009) argued that in the context of
fair-trade goods, CSR contributes to brand loyalty by shaping positive customer perceptions. Park et al. (2022)
revealed that in the retail industry, customers’ perceptions of an organization’s commitment to CSR positively
impact their loyalty to the organization. Furthermore, Choi and La (2023) confirmed that in service-oriented
sectors such as hospitality, travel, and financial services, customers’ awareness of a company’s socially responsible
behavior significantly enhances their loyalty. Collectively, these findings underscore the critical role of CSR in
fostering customer loyalty across diverse industries.
Corporate social responsibility has emerged as a significant determinant of customer loyalty, fostering trust,
emotional attachment, and positive brand perceptions (Ailawadi et al., 2014; Kang & Hustvedt, 2014; Castaldo et
al., 2009; Park et al., 2022). The mediating role of service quality in this relationship, showing that CSR efforts
are more impactful when paired with high service standards. Martinez and Rodriguez del Bosque (2013) revealed
that in the hotel industry, CSR influences customer loyalty through improved service quality perceptions.
Similarly, Perez and Bosque (2015) identified service quality as a critical mediator in the banking sector, where
CSR initiatives strengthen client loyalty. In retailing, Park et al. (2022) found that customers' loyalty is shaped by
their perception of both CSR commitments and the quality of services provided. Furthermore, Choi and La (2023)
confirmed that in service-oriented sectors like hospitality and financial services, superior service quality amplifies
the loyalty-building effects of CSR initiatives. These findings collectively highlight the intertwined roles of CSR
and service quality in enhancing customer loyalty.

Service quality plays a pivotal role in driving customer retention by directly impacting customer satisfaction and
fostering long-term loyalty (Parasuraman et al., 1988; Alshurideh et al., 2023). High-quality service ensures
positive customer experiences, which in turn enhance their commitment to the brand and increase repeat business
(Cronin & Taylor, 1992; Monferrer et al., 2023). It also creates a competitive edge, as customers are more likely
to remain loyal to organizations that consistently deliver exceptional service (Zeithaml et al., 2016). Additionally,
service quality strengthens trust and emotional connections, further reinforcing customer retention, especially in
service-intensive industries (Alshurideh et al., 2023; Monferrer et al., 2023). Therefore, businesses prioritizing
service excellence not only retain customers but also reduce the costs associated with acquiring new ones
(Monferrer et al., 2023). Understanding the relationship between corporate social responsibility and customer
loyalty is vital for organizations aiming to build trust and foster lasting relationships with their customers. This
study focuses on examining how CSR influences service quality and, in turn, affects customer loyalty in the context
of Nepalese commercial banks. Based on existing empirical evidence, research hypotheses have been developed
proposed connections between CSR, service quality, and customer loyalty, which form the foundation of this
investigation.

4.3 Regression Analysis and Test of Hypotheses
This study explores the direct and indirect impacts of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on customer loyalty
(CL), with service quality (SQ) serving as a mediating factor. In this model, CSR is positioned as the independent
CSR accounts for 2.85% of the variance in SQ, with the overall model achieving statistical significance, F(1, 395)
= 9.022, p = 0.001. Further analysis indicates a significant positive relationship between CSR and SQ (β = 0.943,
p = 0.001, LLCI = 0.0675, ULCI = 0.2214), providing robust evidence in support of Hypothesis H , which asserts
that CSR positively affects SQ. These results are consistent with prior research emphasizing the critical role of
CSR in enhancing service quality, which subsequently impacts customer loyalty (Alshurideh et al., 2023;
Monferrer et al., 2023). This highlights the strategic importance of CSR initiatives in fostering superior service
quality and strengthening customer loyalty in competitive markets.

social responsibility (CSR) and service quality (SQ) as the independent variables. The findings reveal a significant
indirect effect of service quality (SQ) on customer loyalty (CL) (β = 0.7126, t = 9.6620, p < 0.001; LLCI = 0.3157,
ULCI = 0.5374). The exclusion of zero from the lower limit confidence interval (LLCI) and upper limit confidence
interval (ULCI) further validates the significance of this relationship. These findings provide strong support for
hypothesis H2, which states that service quality significantly and positively influences customer loyalty. This
result is consistent with prior studies that highlight the critical role of service quality in fostering customer loyalty
(Parasuraman et al., 1988; Cronin & Taylor, 1992; Alshurideh et al., 2023). Furthermore, the regression analysis
demonstrates that corporate social responsibility (CSR) also has a significant positive effect on customer loyalty
(CL), as evidenced by the results (β = 0.0558, t = 1.0122, p = 0.0018; LLCI = 0.0215, ULCI = 0.1232).. The
confidence intervals (LLCI and ULCI) do not include zero, confirming the significance of this relationship. These
findings support the acceptance of hypothesis H3, which asserts that CSR significantly influences customer
loyalty. This aligns with previous research, which highlights the positive impact of CSR initiatives on fostering
customer loyalty (Zeithaml et al., 1996; Martínez & Rodríguez del Bosque, 2013; Alshurideh et al., 2023).
Additionally, the indirect effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on customer loyalty (CL) through service
quality (SQ) is significant, as indicated by the regression results (β = 0.2409; bootstrapped 95% confidence
through its effect on SQ. The confidence intervals do not include zero, confirming the significance of this indirect
effect. These findings support a full mediation model, where SQ fully mediates the relationship between CSR and
CL, thus accepting hypothesis H , which posits that SQ mediates the relationship between CSR and CL. This is
consistent with the prior research highlighting the mediating role of service quality in the CSR-customer loyalty
relationship (Zeithaml et al., 1996; Martínez & Rodríguez del Bosque, 2013).

4.4 Discussions
The results of this study provide strong evidence supporting the positive relationship between corporate social
responsibility and service quality. This finding aligns with previous research indicating that companies that engage
in socially responsible behaviors often enhance their service quality, as CSR initiatives contribute to a positive
organizational reputation and improve customer perceptions (Lee & Shin, 2010). CSR activities, such as
environmental sustainability efforts, ethical business practices, and community engagement, can enhance the
overall service experience by fostering trust and reliability, which in turn improves the quality of service offered
to customers (Kotler & Lee, 2005). This relationship underscores the growing importance of CSR in enhancing
the customer service experience, suggesting that companies should integrate CSR into their operational strategies
to improve service quality.
In addition, the study confirms that service quality is positively associated with customer loyalty, supporting the
notion that customers are more likely to remain loyal to businesses that consistently provide high-quality services.
This result is consistent with the findings of previous studies, such as those by Zeithaml et al. (1996) and
Parasuraman et al. (1988), who highlighted that superior service quality fosters customer trust and satisfaction,
which are key drivers of loyalty. The emphasis on service quality in the service sector, particularly in the hospitality
and banking industries, suggests that businesses must prioritize service excellence to maintain competitive
advantage and customer retention.
Furthermore, the direct positive influence of CSR on CL, as demonstrated in this study, adds to the growing body
of literature supporting the direct benefits of CSR on customer relationships. Previous research has shown that
CSR initiatives not only improve the perception of the company but also foster emotional connections with
customers, leading to increased loyalty (Sen & Bhattacharya, 2001). Customers who perceive a company as
socially responsible are more likely to support it in the long term, as they identify with the company's values and
mission (Bhattacharya & Sen, 2004). This direct relationship between CSR and customer loyalty highlights the
potential of CSR as a strategic tool to build lasting customer relationships.
Asian Institute of Research Journal of Social and Political Sciences Vol.7, No.4, 2024
Finally, the study finds that service quality fully mediates the relationship between CSR and customer loyalty,
suggesting that the impact of CSR on customer loyalty is channeled through its effect on service quality. This
result is consistent with the work of Martínez & del Bosque (2013), who found that CSR influences customer
loyalty indirectly by enhancing service quality. By improving service quality, CSR initiatives help create a more
satisfying customer experience, which in turn leads to greater loyalty. This mediating effect underscores the
importance of focusing on service quality as a key mechanism through which CSR initiatives can influence
customer behavior and loyalty.
5. Conclusion
This study highlights the significant role of corporate social responsibility that plays in enhancing service quality,
which subsequently leads to greater customer loyalty. The positive relationship between CSR and service quality
demonstrates that businesses engaging in socially responsible activities are likely to improve the quality of the
services they provide. Customers today are increasingly aware of the ethical and social practices of the companies
they engage with, and as such, CSR initiatives not only help fulfill societal obligations but also contribute to
tangible improvements in service delivery. By incorporating sustainable practices, ethical values, and community
engagement, organizations are able to strengthen their service offerings, resulting in enhanced customer
satisfaction. This improved service quality creates a deeper emotional connection with customers, which leads to
increased customer trust and satisfaction, ultimately fostering long-term loyalty.
Furthermore, the findings from this study emphasize that CSR has a direct, positive effect on customer loyalty,
and that this impact is mediated through its influence on service quality. Customers tend to reward organizations
that are perceived to act responsibly by becoming more loyal, as they appreciate companies that contribute
positively to society. The service quality that arises from CSR initiatives creates a strong foundation for customer
trust, making customers feel more valued and respected. This connection further solidifies their commitment to
the brand. Therefore, it is evident that CSR not only serves as a tool for societal impact but also functions as a
strategic driver of customer loyalty. As businesses seek to differentiate themselves in competitive markets,
investing in CSR initiatives should be viewed not only as an ethical obligation but also as a long-term business
strategy that enhances service quality and strengthens customer loyalty, ensuring sustained organizational success
and a positive brand reputation.
