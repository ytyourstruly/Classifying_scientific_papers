Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 2
Abstract
According to social identity theory, people are more likely to demand and collectively
work for social change if they can imagine a different set of social relations – “cognitive
alternatives to the status quo”. In prior work, access to environmental cognitive alternatives
(ECA; i.e., access to ideas about how the relationship between humans and the rest of nature
could be more sustainable) correlated with environmental activist intentions and observed
activist behaviour. In three preregistered experiments (N = 3096), we expand this work to
validate a manipulation of environmental cognitive alternatives and examine the causal effects of
environmental cognitive alternatives on identification with and willingness to engage in
environmental activism. Participants either imagined and wrote about a sustainable world, or
were in a control condition. In Study 1 and 2, the manipulation significantly increased scores on
the Environmental Cognitive Alternatives Scale, and analyses supported the construct validity of
the manipulation. The ECA manipulation increased identification with environmental activists
(Study 1, 2, & 3) and willingness to engage in environmental activism (Study 1 & 3). In Study 3
we also tested the effects of the manipulation on opposition to new fossil fuel infrastructure and
found that the ECA manipulation increased opposition. These findings provide evidence that we
developed a valid manipulation, and that environmental cognitive alternatives can generate
support for pro-environmental social change.

Experimentally Elevating Environmental Cognitive Alternatives: Effects on Activist
Identification, Willingness to Act, and Opposition to New Fossil Fuel Projects
Climate change and other environmental crises raise existential threats for human
civilization and other species. Mitigating such environmental threats requires transformative
change across all aspects of human society. Such changes, if they have occurred at all, have
emerged slowly, in large part due to obstruction from vested interests (Oreskes & Conway,
2011). From that perspective, social changes that move humanity toward environmental
sustainability depend on intergroup relations, including the activities and growth of
environmental activist movements that create and demand change from the bottom up. One
strategy to encourage people to support environmental activism is to ask people to consider
positive alternatives to our current trajectory, and what life might be like if humans had a
sustainable relationship with the rest of the natural world. We consider whether such “cognitive
alternatives to the status quo” (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) have the potential to increase
identification with and participation in environmental activism.
Collective Identity and Cognitive Alternatives to the Status Quo
Social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979), as a theory of intergroup relations, was
developed in part to offer an analysis of when people rise up against those with more power to
create social change. That analysis centrally involves collective identity, and the ability of people
to self-define at the collective level. When people identify with a collective that supports pro-
environmental social change, they are more likely to act to bring those changes about (Mackay,
Schmitt, et al., 2021). This is particularly true when the identity is politicized—defined as part of
a struggle to determine social arrangements (Simon & Klandermans, 2001). For example,
identifying with environmental activists predicts willingness to engage in environmental activism
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 4
as well as actual behaviours (Mackay, Cristoffanini, et al., 2021; Schmitt et al., 2019).
Social identity theory also makes predictions regarding whether people identify with
groups as well as how people will attempt to advance the values and interests of those group
identities. In particular, the theory considers people’s subjective understandings of the social
structure. Social identity theory suggests that when people see intergroup relations as more
insecure—as more illegitimate and more unstable—they are more likely to engage in collective
efforts at social change (Tajfel & Turner, 1979). While there have been multiple tests of
illegitimacy and instability (Bettencourt et al., 2001), another aspect of insecurity has received
less attention: cognitive alternatives to the status quo, or the awareness of alternatives to the
current state of intergroup relations that are subjectively plausible and positive.
Access to cognitive alternatives to the status quo can be understood as an awareness of
specific ways in which relations between groups could be different (Reicher & Haslam, 2006;
Tajfel & Turner, 1979). According to Reicher and Haslam (2006), the insecurity of intergroup
relations “is characterized by the fact that individuals are aware of cognitive alternatives to the
status quo and hence can envisage specific ways in which it could be changed” (p. 5). Cognitive
alternatives can be differentiated from instability and illegitimacy “in that cognitive alternatives
reflect the ability to conceive of how the status quo could be different, not whether it will or
should be different” (Wright et al., 2022, p. 716).
Empirical examinations of cognitive alternatives are scarce. Zhang et al. (2013) found
that members of a disadvantaged group who were made aware of a better future for their group
expressed higher group identification and self-esteem. Iyer et al. (2017) found that children of
migrant workers who were told about a better future for their group performed better on
cognitive tasks. Of interest here, however, is the potential of cognitive alternatives to inspire
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 5
collective action for social change, which was dramatically illustrated in the BBC prison study.
Reicher and Haslam (2006) conducted a simulated prison study, assigning participants the roles
of either prisoners or guards. During the experiment, a new prisoner with previous experience in
trade union organizing was introduced. As anticipated by the researchers, this prisoner promptly
formed ideas about how the relationship between prisoners and guards could be different and
communicated them to the group. Subsequently, the prisoners engaged in organized acts of
resistance that eventually led to the “prisoners” and “guards” relating to one another as equals.
The effect of alternative visions on collective efforts at social change has also been
theorized in work on utopian thinking. Noting the similarity to cognitive alternatives in social
identity theory, Kashima and Fernando (2020) write, “the most fundamental function of
utopianism is the provision of an alternative vision for society” (p. 103). In that sense, although
there are some subtle differences between the two constructs (see General Discussion), utopian
thinking can be considered as a kind of cognitive alternative to the status quo that focuses on
ideal alternatives to society at large. Utopian thinking can prompt criticism and delegitimizing of
the status quo and serve as a collective goal for social change (Fernando et al., 2018). When
asked to write about a utopian society, participants reported increased citizenship intentions and
lower system justification (Fernando et al., 2018). Similarly, Badaan et al. (2022) found that
imagining an ideal society that was green, egalitarian, and democratic led participants to report
being more willing to engage in collective action to create a more equal society.
Environmental Cognitive Alternatives
Researchers have applied the concept of cognitive alternatives to the status quo to the
environmental domain and examined “environmental cognitive alternatives”. As cognitive
alternatives are about changes in relationships between social categories, environmental
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 6
cognitive alternatives have been defined as ideas about how the relationship between humans
and the rest of the natural world might be different in ways that are subjectively plausible and
positive (Wright et al., 2020). In other words, such an approach conceptualizes the relationship
between humans and the rest of nature as an intergroup one (Schmitt et al., 2019). Environmental
cognitive alternatives also include alternatives to relationships between human groups, such as
between activists and fossil fuel companies, or between citizens and government (Wright et al.,
2020). In the same way that cognitive alternatives in the BBC Prison Study politicized the
prisoners and led to organized efforts to undermine the guards’ relatively higher status and
power, environmental cognitive alternatives can lead to people identifying with others who want
to challenge power to create pro-environmental social change.
Wright et al. (2020) validated the Environmental Cognitive Alternatives Scale (ECAS)
and found that ECAS scores predicted identification with environmental activism, self-reports of
environmental activist behaviour, and willingness to engage in environmental activism. Wright
et al. (2022) found that ECAS scores predicted observed behaviour—writing a letter to a
government minister demanding bolder action on climate change. Furthermore, Wright et al.’s
(2022) study suggests that at least some of the effects of environmental cognitive alternatives
occur through intergroup processes, as identification with environmental activists (a collective
identity) mediated the relationship between environmental cognitive alternatives and activist
behaviour.
Some recent studies have begun to offer experimental evidence that environmental
cognitive alternatives have a causal effect on environmental activism. In the first of such studies,
based in theorizing on utopian thinking, Fernando et al. (2020) found that participants asked to
consider a “green utopia” expressed higher levels of environmental activist intentions (what the
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 7
authors call “environmental citizenship”). Daysh et al. (2024) asked participants to imagine and
write about a positive future in which climate change had been addressed. In Study 1,
participants who imagined a positive future expressed greater willingness to engage in collective
action to mitigate climate change compared to those in a control condition, but that effect failed
to replicate in Study 2. Further, Bosone et al. (2024) found that participants who read a
description of a sustainable society in 2050 reported higher access to environmental cognitive
alternatives and pro-environmental collective action intentions. However, a limitation of Daysh
et al. (2024) and Bosone et al. (2024) is that they used measures of collective action intentions
that included one or more items referring to individual consumption intentions, thus creating
some uncertainty about the degree to which their findings were relevant to collective action in
the activist sense.
While there is some evidence that environmental cognitive alternatives encourage
environmental activism, only one of the prior studies includes a measure of environmental
activism that is not confounded with individual consumption intentions, and none of them
considered effects on politicized environmental collective identity, such as identification with
environmental activists, despite research and theory suggesting such an identity is proximally
related to activist behaviour (Schmitt et al., 2019; Simon & Klandermans, 2001). Finally, Chester
and Lasko (2021) highlighted the need for social psychology to establish the construct validity of
manipulations before investigating causal relationships between variables. Thus, in the present
studies we attempt to develop and validate an experimental manipulation of environmental
cognitive alternatives and examine its effects on support for environmental activism in high-
powered experiments. Based on social identity theory and previous correlational work, we
predict that imagining a sustainable relationship between humans and the rest of nature will
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 8
cause higher levels of identification with environmental activists and willingness to engage in
environmental activism.
Overview of the Current Studies
In three studies, we manipulated environmental cognitive alternatives to examine their
effects on identification with and support for environmental activism. However, rather than
attempting an ad hoc manipulation, we followed the recommendations of Chester and Lasko
(2021) to first seek construct validation of our manipulation in Studies 1 and 2. Like construct
validation for a psychological scale, we wanted to ensure that our manipulation covaried with the
focal construct as well as some theoretically related constructs, while being distinct from
constructs that are similar, but theoretically more distal. After obtaining evidence that our
manipulation worked as intended, in Study 3 we shifted more directly to hypothesis testing. Data
approved by a university research ethics board.
Study 1
Study 1 aimed to pilot and establish the construct validity of a manipulation of
environmental cognitive alternatives. In Study 1, we initially piloted 3 manipulations, but only
one was successful, and we focus on that manipulation here. The other piloted manipulations and
relevant results are available in Supplements A and B. The successful manipulation asked
participants to spend a few minutes thinking about and writing about what the world would be
like if humans had a sustainable relationship with the rest of the natural world.
Following Chester and Lasko (2021), we examined the construct validity of the
manipulation in two ways: 1) by using a validated manipulation check (i.e. the Environmental
Cognitive Alternatives Scale) and 2) by estimating the manipulation’s effects on multiple
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 9
constructs in the target construct’s nomological network. To establish construct validity, the
manipulation should have the strongest effect on the target construct, weaker effects on
theoretically related constructs, and no effects on theoretically distal or unrelated constructs. We
based the expected nomological network on social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) and
prior empirical work.
As preregistered
manipulation would have the strongest effects on environmental cognitive alternatives compared
to other measured constructs. We expected the manipulation to have relatively strong effects on
activist identification and willingness to engage in activism because social identity theory
assumes that cognitive alternatives have a causal effect on collective action to create change, and
those variables were highly correlated with environmental cognitive alternatives in previous
research (Wright et al., 2020, 2022). We also expected the manipulation to have relatively strong
effects on collective efficacy and climate change hope because in prior work, environmental
cognitive alternatives have correlated with collective efficacy to address environmental problems
(Wright et al., 2022) and experimental manipulations of utopian thinking affected hope (Badaan
et al., 2022; Daysh et al., 2024).
We expected effects a bit weaker still on the perceived (in)stability of the status quo,
based on previous correlational findings (Wright et al., 2020, 2022). We expected the smallest or
non-existent effects on the perceived (il)legitimacy of the status quo and perceptions of
environmental threat, as both constructs are theoretically distal and weakly related to cognitive
alternatives in prior work (Wright et al., 2020, 2022).

Participants
We recruited U.S. residents to complete an online questionnaire via Prolific
condition (after data exclusions). Participants who failed the attention check (n = 11) or who had
missing data on any of the dependent measures (n = 84) were excluded from analyses, resulting
in a final dataset of 565 participants. This sample provides 97% power to detect effects as small
as g = .30 for our preregistered hypotheses.

Design and Procedure
Participants provided informed consent before beginning the experiment and received
$1.75 US for approximately 11 minutes of participation. Participants were randomly assigned to
the ECA condition or the control condition.
Environmental Cognitive Alternatives Condition (ECA Condition). Following a
procedure used in Wright et al. (2020), participants in the ECA condition read: “Humans do not
currently have a sustainable relationship with the rest of the natural world. Human actions have
wreaked havoc on the earth’s ecosystems, including the warming of the planet and resulting
climatic changes. Now, please think about a world different from the current state of our own
where humans have a more harmonious and sustainable relationship with the rest of the natural
environment. Please take 2-3 minutes to write your responses below. Think specifically about
three questions: What would that world be like? How would it be different from the current
world? How might society operate differently?”. Participants provided their thoughts in a text
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 12
box before continuing with the questionnaire.
Control Condition. After completing the consent form, participants in the control
condition immediately proceeded to the dependent measures.
Dependent Measures
Environmental Cognitive Alternatives Scale was first, and the demographics were measured last,
while the order of the remaining measures was randomized for each participant. Unless
otherwise mentioned, in all three studies participants indicated their (dis-)agreement with scale
items on a 7-point Likert-type scale; composite scores were calculated by averaging across items,
after reverse-scoring as needed such that higher values represent higher levels of the measured
dimensions as labelled.
Environmental Cognitive Alternatives Scale (ECAS). We measured environmental
cognitive alternatives using the ECAS (Wright et al., 2020, see Appendix). Statements included,
for example, “I have a clear understanding of all the ways that a sustainable human existence
would differ from our current state of affairs”, or “It is easy to imagine a world where we no
longer use fossil fuels” (α = .92).
Identification with Environmental Activists. Cameron’s (2004) measure of collective
identity was adapted to the category of environmental activists. Participants responded to 8
items, such as, “I have a lot in common with environmental activists” (α = .92).
Willingness to Engage in Environmental Activism. Participants indicated their
A full analysis of the open-ended data exceeds the scope of this paper. However, in this task, participants in all
three studies frequently discussed a world with a cleaner and more stable physical environment, more intact natural
habitats and green spaces, sustainable energy production, sustainable agricultural practices, a world in which
humans are more connected to nature, and a society with equity and harmony among humans, different political and
economic structures, less consumerism and more sustainable consumption practices.
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 13
willingness to engage in activist behaviour on a scale from 1 (very unwilling) to 7 (very willing;
adapted from Schmitt et al., 2019). Described behaviours included, for example, signing
petitions, donating money to environmental groups, or attending a protest (α = .95).
Climate Change Hope. Hope concerning climate change was measured with the
constructive hope scale (Ojala, 2015), with 7 statements reflecting different sources of hope.
Participants indicated the extent to which the statements matched their thinking on a scale from 0
(not at all) to 6 (very well). Statements followed the prompt “I feel hope concerning climate
change…” and included, for instance, “Because we as individuals can change our behavior,
together we can influence climate change in a positive direction” (α = .90).
Perceived Environmental Threat. Four items adapted from the New Environmental
Paradigm (Dunlap & Van Liere, 1978) were used to measure perceived environmental threat.
Participants responded to items such as “Life as we know it is under imminent threat from
environmental degradation” (α = .87).
Perceptions of Legitimacy. Legitimacy of the environmental status quo was measured
using three items from Wright et al. (2020), e.g., “Humans are entitled to use the natural world in
whatever way they see fit” (α = .75).
Perceptions of Stability. Stability of the environmental status quo was measured using 3
items from Wright et al. (2020), for example, “The damage humans cause to the environment
will not substantially lessen over the next 15 years.” (α = .74).
Collective Efficacy (Humans). We adapted van Zomeren and colleagues’ (2013) scale to
measure collective efficacy beliefs regarding humans’ ability to mitigate climate change.
Participants responded to 4 items, for example, “Humans can achieve their common goal of
stopping global warming” (α = .91).
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 14
Demographics. Participants indicated their age, ethnicity, gender, and political
orientation. Political orientation was measured with two items, asking participants to describe
their views on social and economic issues on a scale from 1, “very liberal” to 7, “very
conservative” (r = .83; adapted from Liu & Latané, 1998).

Main Analyses
As preregistered, we used one-tailed tests for our main, directional hypotheses. As shown
reported significantly higher ECAS scores, t(563) = 4.17, p < .001; higher identification with
environmental activists, t(563) = 3.22, p < .001; and higher willingness to engage in
environmental activism, t(563) = 2.15, p = .016. There was a non-significant trend for the ECA
condition to lead to lower perceived stability of the environmental status quo, t(563) = -.1.58, p =
.057). There were no effects of condition on perceived collective efficacy of humans, t(563) =
0.99, p = .161; perceived environmental threat, t(563) = 0.75, p = .227; climate change hope,
t(563) = 0.54, p = .295; or perceived legitimacy of the environmental status quo, t(563) = -0.40, p
= .345).

Although not preregistered, to examine whether the effects of the manipulation on
activist identification and willingness to engage in environmental activism were mediated by
ECAS scores we conducted tests of mediation using PROCESS model 4 (Hayes, 2022).
Bootstrapping results revealed that the ECA manipulation exerted significant positive indirect
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 17
effects on identification with environmental activists and willingness to engage in environmental
activism (b = 0.25, 95% CI [0.128, 0.380] and b = 0.28, 95% CI [0.149, 0.429], respectively).
The direct effect of the ECA manipulation was not significant for identification with
environmental activists (b = 0.11, SE = 0.10, p = .126) or willingness to engage in
1-tailed
environmental activism (b = -0.01, SE = 0.11, p = .448). These results are consistent with
1-tailed
the idea that effects on activist identification and willingness to engage in activism are due to the
manipulation’s effect on environmental cognitive alternatives.
Discussion
Study 1 provides evidence for the validity of our manipulation of environmental
cognitive alternatives. First, the manipulation led to higher scores on the Environmental
Cognitive Alternatives Scale and this was the largest effect. In addition, the pattern of effects on
other variables measured to establish construct validity were mostly as expected. We found
significant effects on identification with environmental activists and on willingness to engage in
environmental activism, the second and third strongest effects. We expected and found a
relatively small effect on the perceived (in)stability of the relationship between humans and
nature; effects on that variable were marginally significant and fourth largest in terms of effect
size. And as anticipated, effects were extremely small for the perceived illegitimacy of relations
between humans and the rest of nature, and the perception of environmental threat. Contrary to
expectations, we had anticipated relatively strong effects on collective efficacy and hope, but
effects on these variables were very small and non-significant.
Although the primary purpose of Study 1 was to validate a manipulation, the significant
effects of the ECA condition on environmental activist identification and willingness to engage
in environmental activism are consistent with the hypothesis that cognitive alternatives have a
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 18
causal effect on activist identification and willingness to engage in activism. This interpretation
is further supported by the finding that ECAS scores mediated effects of condition on
identification and willingness to engage in activism.
Study 2
Having obtained initial evidence of the construct validity of our manipulation of
environmental cognitive alternatives in Study 1, we attempted to replicate these findings in Study
2. Our procedure was largely the same, with a few alterations. First, we modified the
manipulation slightly. In Study 1, before being asked to engage in the environmental cognitive
alternatives writing task, participants read a short reminder about the environmental status quo
and existential threats to humans and other species. It is possible that it is exclusively this
framing that produces the effects on our dependent measures so in Study 2 we removed them.
The rest of the manipulation is identical to Study 1. Further, we made the control condition more
like the ECA condition by introducing a control writing task.
In Study 1, we measured collective efficacy in terms of humans’ ability to mitigate
climate change. However, given the effects we observed on identification with environmental
activists and willingness to engage in environmental activism, we reasoned that it might be more
likely to find collective efficacy effects for environmental activists than humans as a whole, and
thus modified our measure accordingly. We also found little evidence of an effect of the
manipulation on climate change hope in Study 1. To determine whether this might be due to the
way we measured hope, we created a new measure that focussed more on the emotional
experience of hope rather than the more cognitive assessment of reasons to feel hope we used in
Study 1. We also dropped our measure of perceived environmental threat and replaced it with a
more specific measure of climate change beliefs. Finally, we also added a measure of support for
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 19
climate change mitigation policies.
we predicted that the manipulation would increase environmental cognitive alternatives,
identification with environmental activists, willingness to engage in environmental activism, and
support for climate change policies. For collective efficacy, climate change hope, perceived
stability of the status quo, perceived legitimacy of the status quo, and climate change beliefs, we
anticipated smaller effects compared to those for environmental cognitive alternatives,
identification with environmental activists, willingness to engage in environmental activism and
support for climate change policies.

responses indicative of bots (n = 1) were excluded. This resulted in a final dataset of 1144 U.S.
participants (control condition: n = 584; ECA condition: n = 560). This sample provides 92%
power to detect a small effect of g = .18 for our preregistered hypotheses (based on the smallest
effect size of interest in Study 1).
This final dataset included 571 women, 548 men, 5 participants identifying as either
gender non-conforming or non-binary, 12 participants indicating multiple gender identities, 2
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 20
trans women, 1 trans man, and 5 participants not disclosing their gender identity. Participants’
mean age was 40.2 years (SD = 12.5). The mean annual income was 60,000 USD, and
participants’ mean political orientation was slightly left of center (M = 3.5, SD = 1.7).
Participants on average believed climate change is real, human-caused, and has negative effects
(measured before the manipulation; M = 6.0 “agree”, SD = 1.2). Further demographic
Design and Procedure
After providing informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to the ECA or
control condition.
ECA Condition. Participants read “We would like you to spend a few minutes thinking
creatively. Please think about a world different from the current state of our own where humans
have a more harmonious and sustainable relationship with the rest of the natural environment.
Please take 2-3 minutes to write your responses below. Think specifically about three questions:
What would that world be like? How would it be different from the current world? How might
society operate differently?” (adapted from Wright et al., 2020). Participants entered their
responses in a text box.
Control Condition. Participants in the control condition were asked to “spend a few
minutes thinking creatively” and to consider and enter into a text box as many potential uses for
a shoebox as they could imagine.
Dependent Measures
The ECAS appeared first for all participants. Demographic questions appeared at the end
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 21
of the survey. The remaining measures were presented in random order.
We measured ECAS (α = . 94), identification with environmental activists (α = .93),
willingness to engage in environmental activism (α = .95), perceptions of legitimacy (α = .81),
and perceptions of stability (α = .80) as we did in Study 1.
Climate Change Beliefs. Participants responded to a 3-item measure of climate change
beliefs (based partly on Milfont et al., 2017) indicating whether they agree that climate change is
real, human-caused, and will have serious negative impacts on human civilization (α = .90) .
Climate Change Hope. We used a measure of climate change hope consisting of 2 face-
valid items: “I feel hopeful about how humans will respond to climate change” and “When I
think about climate change I feel hopeless” (reverse-scored), r = .50.
Collective Efficacy (Activists). Van Zomeren and colleagues’ (2013) scale was adapted
to measure collective efficacy beliefs for “environmental activists” (instead of “humans” as in
Study 1) regarding their ability to mitigate climate change. Participants responded to 4 items
(e.g., “Environmental activists can achieve their common goal of stopping global warming”; α =
.96).
Support for Climate Change Policies. A new measure of support for climate change
policies (loosely adapted from Dietz et al., 2007) asked participants to rate their support or
opposition to 14 government policies that would reduce the threat of climate change on a scale
from 1 (strongly oppose) to 7 (strongly support). Policies included, for example, “Government
subsidized professional training for jobs in renewable energy and environmental protection” (α =
If participants completed at least 50% of items for a scale, the scale score was computed using the mean of those
completed items. If there were less than 50% of items, those scale scores were not calculated. Analyses were
performed using pairwise deletion.
To address concerns about attrition, we also measured climate beliefs prior to the manipulation (see Supplement
A). Controlling for pre-test climate change beliefs did not alter results (see Supplement B).

.96).
Demographics. Participants reported their income, age, ethnicity, gender, sexual
orientation, political orientation (r = .82; adapted from Liu & Latané, 1998), and whether they
identified as someone with a disability.

When, as preregistered, we excluded participants who did not write about anything
related to the topic we asked them to write about, the pattern of results did not change, with one

exception – support for climate change policy was significantly higher in the ECA condition (M

.11).
As preregistered, we conducted mediation analyses using PROCESS model 4 (Hayes,
2022) to test whether ECAS scores mediated the effect of the manipulation on identification with
environmental activists, willingness to engage in environmental activism and support for climate
change policies (see Supplement B). As we only found effects of the manipulation on
identification with activists, we only report the mediation test with that outcome. The ECA
manipulation exerted significant positive indirect effects on identification with environmental
activists (b = 0.29, 95% CI [0.201, 0.383]). The direct effect of the ECA manipulation on
identification with environmental activists was not significant (b = -0.12, SE = 0.07, p =
1-tailed
.053). Although not preregistered we did perform a similar analysis on activist collective
efficacy, as it was also significantly affected by condition. The indirect effect of the ECA
manipulation on activist collective efficacy was significant (b = 0.34, 95% CI [0.237, 0.450]) and
the direct effect of the ECA manipulation on activist collective efficacy was not significant (b = -
0.12, SE = 0.08, p = .061). These results are consistent with the idea that effects on
1-tailed
environmental activist identification and activist collective efficacy are due to the manipulation’s
effect on environmental cognitive alternatives.
Discussion
As in Study 1, we found that our manipulation significantly affected ECAS scores, with
the effect sizes for ECAS scores being larger than for any of the other dependent measures. We
We also preregistered two serial mediations to understand whether the effect of the ECA condition on willingness
to engage in environmental activism and support for climate change policies is mediated by ECAS scores and
identification with environmental activists. The indirect effects for both of these analyses were significant. Results
for these analyses can be found in Supplement B.
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 26
again found that the ECA manipulation led to an increase in identification with environmental
activists. We did not replicate the effect on willingness to engage in environmental activism, or
on the added measure of support for climate change policies. However, when excluding
participants who did not write about the topic we asked them to write about, the effect of the
manipulation on support for climate change policies became significant. Effects were very small
and non-significant for legitimacy and stability of the environmental status quo, climate change
hope, and climate change beliefs. Unlike Study 1, where we found non-significant effects on the
collective efficacy of humans to mitigate climate change, in Study 2 we found that collective
efficacy of activists was significantly affected by the manipulation. Although effects in Study 2
were smaller overall, as a test of construct validity of the manipulation the results are still
supportive of the effectiveness of the manipulation. The strongest effects occur for the focal
concept – environmental cognitive alternatives. Furthermore, we found significant effects on two
theoretically related concepts – activist collective efficacy and identification with environmental
activists. We also found effects close to zero on concepts that theoretically should be more
distally related or not related at all, such as climate change beliefs, and the legitimacy of the
status quo. Combined with the results of Study 1, we have evidence for the validity of our
manipulation as an experimental induction of environmental cognitive alternatives.
Study 3
In Study 3 we turned more directly to hypothesis testing and made several relevant
changes to our study design. First, we took the important step of removing the measure of ECAS.
While the measure was essential in the prior two studies, it can act as a manipulation in itself. In
other words, responding to items about how well one can imagine a sustainable world will
necessarily bring some thoughts about a sustainable world to mind. Thus, including the measure
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 27
can increase the salience of cognitive alternatives in the control condition as well, and therefore
reduce the difference between conditions and the effects of the manipulation. Additionally, the
ECAS measure is no longer needed as a manipulation check as the prior studies provided
evidence that the manipulation most directly impacts that variable.
In Study 3, we also attempted to address some differences in materials used in Study 1
and 2. In Study 1, the cognitive alternatives manipulation began with a reminder of the status
quo, with participants first reading about the unharmonious and unsustainable relationship
between humans and the rest of the natural world. In Study 2, we did not include a reminder of
the environmental status quo before participants were asked to generate environmental cognitive
alternatives. To investigate the extent to which such a reminder might have affected the
manipulation, in Study 3 we manipulated the presence of a status quo reminder independently of
the manipulation of cognitive alternatives. To strengthen the ECA manipulation, we also
incorporated a procedure used by Fernando et al. (2020) to include consolidation statements, as
these questions would require participants to continue thinking about their previously generated
environmental cognitive alternatives.
In Study 3, we only recruited participants who believe in climate change. Furthermore, in
Study 1, our manipulation did not significantly increase human collective efficacy, but in Study
2, we found significant effects on activist collective efficacy. To investigate this difference
empirically, we measured human and activist collective efficacy in Study 3. We also replaced the
measure of climate change policy support with a more tangible measure of opposition to fossil
fuel infrastructure expansion that presents participants with real-life fossil fuel infrastructure
projects. This is an important outcome because reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and
having a chance to limit global warming to 1.5℃ requires that all future fossil fuel projects be
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 28
scrapped (International Energy Agency, 2021). Despite its importance, opposition to the
expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure has received little attention in previous psychological
research. Focusing on this outcome is an important contribution of the current research.
Furthermore, in Study 3, we decided to change the control task. Writing about potential
uses of a shoebox in Study 2 may have unintentionally led participants to think about waste
reduction through “reuse” of materials, which could have affected our dependent variables by
priming environmentalism. Therefore, we used a writing task that carries less potential to induce
thinking about sustainability.
We hypothesized that, compared to the control, the ECA condition would lead to higher
identification with environmental activists, willingness to engage in environmental activism,
human collective efficacy to deal with climate change, environmental activist collective efficacy
to deal with climate change, and opposition to fossil fuel expansion projects. We also tested the
possibility of a 2-way interaction on these dependent measures such that the effects of the ECA
manipulation would be stronger for participants who have been reminded of the environmental
status quo compared to participants not reminded of the status quo. We also examined whether
the ECA manipulation would have a stronger effect on activist efficacy compared to human
efficacy.

pre-screening questionnaire were recruited. As preregistered
data from 1300 participants after potential data exclusions. After data collection, all participants
who failed the attention check (n = 18), who had missing data on more than 50% of the
dependent measures (n = 93), or whose responses were indicative of bots (n = 1) were excluded
from analyses, resulting in a final dataset of 1387 participants. This sample provides 96% power
to detect effects of g = .18. All participants received monetary compensation for their
participation ($1.93 US for approximately 9 minutes).
In a free-response question, 724 participants identified as men, 609 as women, and in two
closed-ended questions, 66 participants indicated they would like to be included in a nonbinary
category, and 50 in a transgender category. Two participants indicated they were unsure in which
category they would like to be included, 5 indicated that neither nonbinary nor binary, and 23
indicated that neither transgender nor cisgender describes them. The mean age was 39.3 (SD =
13.9) years. The mean annual household income for participants was about $65,000 US.
Participants’ mean for political orientation was “somewhat liberal” (M = 2.9, SD = 1.6). Further
Design and Procedure
After indicating their informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to one of
four conditions in a 2 x 2 design manipulating environmental cognitive alternatives (control vs.
ECA condition), and reminders of the environmental status quo (reminder vs. no reminder).
Status Quo Reminder Manipulation. Prior to the ECA manipulation, half of
participants read a short paragraph about the current environmental status quo, outlining how
human actions have damaged the earth’s ecosystems (adapted from Wright et al., 2020).
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 30
Participants read: “Humans do not currently have a sustainable relationship with the rest of the
natural world. Human actions have severely damaged the earth’s ecosystems, including the
warming of the planet and resulting climatic changes, like increased forest fires, flooding, or
heatwaves. Human behavior has damaged the health of the planet to such a degree that
environmental problems now pose threats to the health and existence of the human species.” The
other half of participants did not receive this reminder.
ECA Manipulation. In the control condition for the ECA manipulation, participants
were asked to think and write about their typical morning routine. In the ECA condition,
participants responded to an environmental cognitive alternatives writing task as in the first two
studies (adapted from Wright et al., 2020). Participants were asked to think about a world
different from the current state of our own where humans have a more harmonious and
sustainable relationship with the rest of the natural environment and to describe their thoughts
about what that world would be like. To strengthen the manipulation, and following a procedure
similar to Fernando et al. (2020), participants in the ECA condition were also asked to indicate
their agreement with eight close-ended items about their responses in order to consolidate their
visions. The items were “This world would be peaceful and fair”, “In this world, no one would
have much more wealth than anyone else”, “People in this world would be happy”, “People in
this world would be healthy”, “This world would run on renewable energy, not fossil fuels”,
“This world would have clean air and clean water”, “This world would have a lot of trees and
greenery”, and “In this world, biodiversity and natural habitats would be protected”. Broadly
reflecting the content of participants’ responses in Study 1 and 2, those items were chosen to
include changes to human relationships, as well as changes to the relationship between humans
and the rest of the natural world.
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 31
Measures
Participants first completed the measure of identification with environmental activists (α
= .91) and then willingness to engage in environmental activism (α = .90); both were measured
as in the previous 2 studies, but were cut by 2 and 4 items respectively, to make the study
shorter. Participants then completed additional measures in the order reported below.
Opposition to Fossil Fuel Expansion Projects. We presented participants with short
descriptions of the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP, an under-construction natural gas pipeline,
α = .93), the Willow Project (an oil-drilling project in Alaska, α = .94), and a proposal for a fossil
asked to indicate their opinions about the projects (e.g., “I believe the MVP pipeline should be
stopped”). The three different projects were presented in randomized order. We preregistered
investigating the effects on support for the three fossil fuel expansion projects-subscales
individually, as well as collapsed into one scale (α = .96).
Collective Efficacy. Measures of collective efficacy beliefs to mitigate climate change
for “humans” (α = .86) and for “environmental activists” (α = .91) were presented in randomized
order (adapted from van Zomeren et al., 2013). Participants responded to 3 items each (e.g.,
“Environmental activists can achieve their common goal of stopping global warming”), with
higher values representing higher collective efficacy beliefs.
Demographics. Participants reported their income, age, ethnicity, gender (adapted from
Beischel et al., 2023), sexual orientation, political orientation (r = .81; adapted from Liu &
Latané, 1998), and whether they identified as someone with a disability.
If participants completed at least 50% of items for a scale, the scale score was computed using the mean of those
completed items. If there were less than 50% of items, those scale scores were not calculated. Analyses were
performed using pairwise deletion.

Main Analyses
As preregistered, we conducted regression analyses to test for 2-way interactions between
the ECA manipulation and the status quo reminder manipulation. However, there were no
significant 2-way interactions predicting any of the dependent variables and no significant main
effects of the status quo reminder manipulation (Supplement B). Therefore, for ease of
comparability with the prior two studies, we present our analyses as one-tailed t-tests of the
effect of the ECA manipulation only. The results for the ECA manipulation were the same in the
t-tests and in the regression analysis that controls for the status quo reminder manipulation.

collective efficacy, t(1381) = 2.16, p = .015. Although not significant, participants in the ECA
condition tended to report higher activist collective efficacy than those in the control, t(1381) =
1.60, p = .055. The pattern of results did not change when we excluded participants who did not
write anything related to the topic we asked them to write about (see Supplement B for details).
To examine whether the manipulations had differential effects on activist collective
efficacy compared to human collective efficacy, we conducted a 2 x 2 x 2 mixed model
ANOVA, with the type of efficacy being a within-subject (repeated measures) independent
variable. In this ANOVA, we found no differential effects of the ECA condition, the status quo
reminder, and their interaction on activist collective efficacy compared to human collective
efficacy, all F(1,1379) ≤ 0.59, all p ≥ .444, all η 2 ≤ .01.
Exploratory analyses using PROCESS model 4 (Hayes, 2022) showed that the effect of
the ECA manipulation on willingness to engage in environmental activism and on opposition to
fossil fuel expansion projects was mediated by identification with environmental activists. The
ECA manipulation exerted significant indirect effects on willingness to engage in environmental
activism (b = 0.28, 95% CI [0.181, 0.384]) and on opposition to fossil fuel infrastructure (b =
0.21, 95% CI [0.134, 0.291]), while the direct effects of the ECA manipulation on willingness to
engage in environmental activism (b = -0.02, SE = 0.06, p = .368) and on opposition to
1-tailed
fossil fuel expansion projects (b = 0.04, SE = 0.06, p = .290) were not significant.

Discussion
In Study 3, we found that our manipulation of environmental cognitive alternatives
affected environmental activist identification, willingness to engage in environmental activism,
opposition to fossil-fuel expansion projects, and human collective efficacy to address climate
change. The only variable that was not significantly affected by the manipulation was collective
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 36
efficacy of activists. Therefore, our experiment offers compelling evidence that environmental
cognitive alternatives have a causal effect on environmental activist identification, willingness to
engage in activism, and opposition to fossil-fuel expansion projects. Further, we found that the
effect of the ECA manipulation on willingness to engage in environmental activism and on
opposition to fossil fuel expansion projects was mediated by identification with environmental
activists. These results, which replicate previous correlational findings (Wright et al., 2022),
emphasize the importance of activist identity in carrying the effect of environmental cognitive
alternatives to outcomes related to social change.
To explore whether the salience of the environmental status quo might moderate the
effectiveness of environmental cognitive alternatives, in Study 3 we also manipulated whether or
not participants received a status quo reminder prior to the ECA manipulation. We reasoned that
as environmental cognitive alternatives offer solutions to environmental problems, they might be
the most effective among people who are aware of those problems. We found no evidence that
the status quo reminder moderated the effects of environmental cognitive alternatives. In our
study, it might be that a short, simple reminder did little to alter people’s awareness of
environmental problems.
Having found different results for the ECA manipulation on collective efficacy of
humans (Study 1, p = .161, g =.08) and collective efficacy of activists (Study 2, p = .007, g =
.15), we measured both forms of efficacy in Study 3. We found that the ECA manipulation led to
significantly higher human collective efficacy, but not for activist efficacy. However, the effect
on activist efficacy was just outside the critical value for significance, and the difference in the
effect of condition on activist versus human efficacy was not significant. Overall, across studies
we have variable evidence that both human and activist efficacy can be influenced by
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 37
environmental cognitive alternatives.
Additional Analyses across Studies: Robustness Checks and Tests of Moderation
For each study we tested whether the significant effects we found were robust to the
inclusion of age, gender, ethnicity, and political orientation as controls (see Supplement B). The
inclusion of controls had trivial consequences for effect sizes; in only two cases did the effect of
condition drop to just below statistical significance (on willingness to engage in environmental
activism in Study 1, and human collective efficacy in Study 3).
We also examined whether demographic variables moderated the effects of condition in
each study (Supplement B). Of the 58 interactions we tested, only three were significant, no
variables were significant moderators in more than one study, and in no study did we find more
than one significant moderator. Thus, we find no compelling evidence of moderation across
studies. This suggests that the manipulation’s success is not limited to particular groups.
However, we were limited to generalizations across heterogeneous groups (i.e., comparing White
and BIPOC participants; comparing women and men, but not other genders) and detecting
different effects for different groups was not prioritized in our study designs.
General Discussion
Addressing climate change and other environmental problems will require social change
at many levels. We found that increasing access to environmental cognitive alternatives can
support such changes by increasing identification with and willingness to engage in
environmental activism. While there is some prior evidence that environmental cognitive
alternatives, or the related construct of utopian environmental thinking, has a causal effect on
pro-environmental outcomes (Bosone et al., 2024; Daysh et al., 2024), only one (Fernando et al.,
2020) offers unambiguous evidence of an effect on environmental activism, none examine
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 38
identification with environmental activists, and none of them are based on a validated
manipulation.
We addressed this gap by first creating and validating a manipulation of environmental
cognitive alternatives in Study 1 and 2. The ECA manipulation increased environmental
cognitive alternatives in two studies and demonstrated expected weaker effects on conceptually
more distally related measures, such as perceived instability and illegitimacy of the status quo.
At the same time the manipulation affected theoretically related constructs, most consistently
affecting identification with environmental activists. These results suggest that our manipulation
can be used with confidence to investigate the effects of environmental cognitive alternatives.
Having validated the manipulation in the first two studies, in Study 3 we focussed on
hypothesis testing and found that the ECA manipulation affected activist identification,
willingness to engage in activism, and opposition to fossil fuel projects. Building on Study 1 and
2, Study 3 provides evidence that environmental cognitive alternatives have a causal effect on
support for pro-environmental social change. Furthermore, across studies the effects of the ECA
manipulation were robust to the inclusion of political orientation, age, gender, and ethnicity.
Environmental Cognitive Alternatives and Identification with Environmental Activists
We found consistent evidence that environmental cognitive alternatives increased
identification with environmental activists. Furthermore, across the three studies, effect sizes for
environmental activist identification were relatively high. Excluding ECAS scores, the largest
effect was on identification in Study 1 and 3, and in Study 2, the second largest effect was on
activist identification. To our knowledge, this is the first study to experimentally investigate the
effect of environmental cognitive alternatives on environmental activist identification. In Study
3, we also found that environmental activist identification mediated the effect of the ECA
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 39
manipulation on willingness to engage in environmental activism and opposition to fossil fuel
expansion projects. This provides evidence that intergroup identity processes carry the effect of
environmental cognitive alternatives on intergroup outcomes. In line with our findings,
identification with environmental activists has been shown to be a proximal predictor of past
self-reported environmental activist behaviour (Dono et al., 2010), self-reported willingness to
engage in environmental activism (Fielding et al., 2008), and observed donation behaviour and
environmental activism (Mackay, Cristoffanini, et al., 2021). More generally, such “politicized”
collective identities have been found to predict social protest across a range of intergroup
contexts (Stürmer & Simon, 2004; van Zomeren et al., 2018). Nonetheless, research that has
successfully manipulated politicized identity is rare. Thus, our findings are relevant for research
contexts in which it would be important to manipulate politicized identity, as well as practically
among those who aim to mobilise people to work for social change. As is consistent with social
identity theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979), access to cognitive alternatives can be effective at
creating and enhancing politicized identities.
Environmental Cognitive Alternatives, Collective Efficacy, and Hope
We found somewhat mixed results of the ECA manipulation on collective efficacy to
mitigate climate change. The ECA manipulation did not significantly affect human collective
efficacy in Study 1, did affect environmental activist collective efficacy in Study 2, and in Study
3, we found human collective efficacy, but not activist efficacy, was significantly affected by the
manipulation. However, these apparently mixed results are more consistent than they first
appear, as across studies and both types of efficacy, effect sizes are roughly similar (Study 1 g =
.08; Study 2 g = .15; Study 3 g’s = .09, .12). Thus, in total it does seem reasonable to conclude
that the ECA manipulation has a small effect on collective efficacy (see also Bosone et al.,
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 40
2024). However, given the relative size of the effects, it is clear that the effects of the
manipulation on other variables can not be explained by collective efficacy. Similarly, prior
correlational work found that measures of ECAS were correlated with efficacy, but that the
ability of ECAS scores to predict activist identification and willingness to engage in activism
was robust to the inclusion of efficacy as a control (Wright et al., 2022). Although environmental
cognitive alternatives appear distinct from collective efficacy, they might be more consistent
with a more multifaceted conceptualization of collective agency, which includes the perception
of group goals and collective goal pursuit (Fritsche, 2022; Reicher & Haslam, 2012). Compared
to collective efficacy, the latter two concepts might be more strongly related to cognitive
alternatives.
We found no evidence that our manipulation of environmental cognitive alternatives
affected hope about climate change. In hindsight, it makes sense to consider hope as relatively
distinct from cognitive alternatives. Cognitive alternatives are about being able to imagine how
things could be different, while hope is more about feeling confident that things will change for
the better. It is possible to imagine how things could be different while having no confidence
they will be. Importantly, we found effects of environmental cognitive alternatives independent
of hope. In other words, in our studies the motivational implications of cognitive alternatives do
not depend on people being hopeful that those alternatives will become a reality. However, other
research has found that hope mediated an indirect effect of visions of a sustainable world on pro-
environmental intentions (Badaan et al., 2022; Daysh et al., 2024; but see Hornsey & Fielding,
2016), warranting further research to resolve these empirical discrepancies.
Limitations and Future Directions
Across the three studies, we established construct validity for our manipulation and found
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 41
evidence that access to environmental cognitive alternatives can increase support for
environmental activism and pro-environmental social change (i.e. opposition to new fossil fuel
projects). Nonetheless, it is important to note that we found rather small effect sizes. This is not
entirely surprising as our manipulation consisted of a relatively brief (2-3 minutes) online task.
In Study 3, we attempted to strengthen the manipulation by including close-ended consolidation
items. Future research might empirically investigate the effect of adding these items to
understand whether they alter the effectiveness of the manipulation. More broadly, future
research could explore how this type of intervention might be scaled up to be more involved and
immersive, and how people can be encouraged to form more detailed cognitive alternatives. For
example, the effects of the intervention may be strengthened by increasing the time spent on the
task, adding opportunities for reflection on specific nuances of how society might operate
differently, or including other ways in which people elaborate on what they imagine.
Across the three studies, we did not observe any consistent patterns of moderation by age,
gender, ethnicity, or political orientation. However, considering that responsibilities for and
vulnerabilities to environmental harm are distributed unequally across groups, it is worth more
directly and intentionally testing the extent to which environmental cognitive alternatives might
work differently for different groups. We tested and developed this manipulation by drawing on
U.S. online samples; thus, future research could determine whether this manipulation works in
similar ways across different cultural and national contexts, including the Global South.
Our manipulation allowed participants to generate their own cognitive alternatives.
Future research might investigate the content of what people imagine and how it matters. It
would also be helpful for future research to develop and validate manipulations of environmental
cognitive alternatives that provide specific visions of a sustainable world, as such manipulations
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 42
would both allow for testing the effects of the content of cognitive alternatives (see Fernando et
al., 2020), as well as provide practical guidance for environmental advocates who want to
present the public with specific visions of a sustainable world that will motivate support for pro-
environmental social change. On the other hand, it might be the case that the self-generated
nature of the cognitive alternatives in our studies is important for a sense of ownership or
plausibility. Thus, future research might examine whether a creative, self-generated process
might be more effective in mobilising people to support social change than providing people
with a fully formed vision that they had no role in generating (Hamann & Legler, 2022).
Future work could benefit by integrating theorizing on cognitive alternatives and utopian
thinking. Utopian thinking concerns alternatives to society in a broad sense; cognitive
alternatives can equally apply to broad contexts (such as the relationship between humans and
the rest of nature) but also to more specific contexts of intergroup relations (such as the
relationship between prisoners and guards; Reicher & Haslam, 2006). Utopian thinking concerns
an ideal alternative, while cognitive alternatives assume a subjectively better, but not necessarily
ideal alternative. Social identity theory is explicit about cognitive alternatives involving
imagined changes in intergroup relationships; theorizing on utopian thinking does not explicitly
make such a claim, although changes to intergroup relations are likely implicit in most types of
utopian thinking. As mentioned in the introduction, these constructs are highly overlapping, as
they both involve positive, alternative visions for a set of social relations, and both theoretical
perspectives predict that thinking about such alternatives can motivate people to support and
contribute to making those alternatives real. Arguably, these perspectives share a common
psychological process.
However, there are different emphases in each perspective, and each makes unique
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 43
contributions to understanding how thinking about alternatives can lead to social change. In the
case of utopian thinking, well-developed theorizing has pointed to three functions (i.e.,
outcomes) of utopian thinking that are related to its motivational qualities: change, criticism of
the status quo, and compensation (Fernando et al., 2018), and has pointed to different utopian
prototypes (Kashima & Fernando, 2020). On the other hand, cognitive alternatives, and social
identity theory more generally, point to the intergroup implications of alternative visions, and, as
emphasized in this paper, the important role of collective, politicized identities in motivating
organized efforts at social change. In sum, these are complementary perspectives that are not
mutually exclusive.
In contrast to our findings, fantasy realisation theory (Oettingen, 2000, 2012; Oettingen
& Reininger, 2016) suggests that positive fantasies can reduce energization and goal-directed
behaviour, unless people engage in mental contrasting – contrasting a positive future with
present reality including the impediments to the realization of the positive future, and thus the
feasibility of reaching the desired future. From that perspective, one might expect that imagining
environmental cognitive alternatives, which could be considered a positive fantasy, might lower
motivations to bring that world into being. However, work on utopian thinking suggests that this
is not the case. Fernando et al. (2018) found that utopian thinking enhanced criticism of the
status quo and intentions to support social change. Most importantly, they found these effects
resulted from how utopian thinking spontaneously led to mental contrasting with the status quo.
Nonetheless, future work could consider whether and how asking people to consider
environmental cognitive alternatives might backfire and undermine support for pro-
environmental social change. For example, Daysh et al. (2024) found that visions of a
sustainable world have an indirect negative effect on pro-environmental action mediated by
Effects of Environmental Cognitive Alternatives 44
reduced fear. Similarly, utopian thinking might encourage disengagement when it plays a
compensatory (i.e. escapist) function (Fernando et al., 2018). More generally, future work might
systematically investigate moderators of environmental cognitive alternatives. For example,
Bosone et al. (2024) found that environmental identity and psychological proximity to climate
change enhanced the effects of visions of a sustainable future, and Fernando et al. (2020) found
positive appraisals of green utopia led to stronger effects.
Conclusions
The kind of societal changes needed if humans are to avoid the worst consequences of
climate change are unlikely without the support of large-scale activism to put pressure on elites
and powerful institutions to stop conducting “business as usual”. We found that having access to
ideas about what a sustainable world could be like – environmental cognitive alternatives – was
useful in generating support for such activism. Across three studies, we established construct
validity for our manipulation and found evidence that access to environmental cognitive
alternatives can increase identification with environmental activism, willingness to engage in
activism, and opposition to fossil fuel expansion projects.
