Abstract
Why people migrate abroad and its explanation in the framework of economic approaches, factors of attraction
and repulsion and duality of poverty and migration have been the subject of migration studies. Migration among
the people of Afghanistan has a long tradition, however, during the last few decades, these continuous flows of
migration and return have taken an unprecedented collective and scale form. This article seeks to explain the
social issue of migration from Afghanistan with emphasis on the tendencies and supporting factors. The
investigated factors are on three levels: micro (individual characteristics), medium (transnational networks) and
macro (a person's understanding of the economic, social and political conditions of the countries of origin and
destination). The research method is quantitative and survey-based, and the data was collected through a
questionnaire among 850 people aged 18 years and above, who were selected by multi-stage sampling method.
The results showed that people's attitude towards Afghanistan's economic, social and political situation at the
macro level and transnational migration networks at the intermediate level have a significant effect on the
tendency to migrate. At the micro level and among the social characteristics, the variables of age, education and
ethnicity have the most effect on the desire to migrate. From this article, it can be concluded that there is a
negative attitude towards the current conditions and the future of Afghanistan, the migration culture, as well as
the Afghan diaspora and transnational migration networks in the neighboring countries Iran's Mullahs have a
great role in the formation of migration abroad among the mindset of Afghans.
Keywords: Social issue of Migration, Tendency to Migrate, Transnational Networks, Political Situation,

1. Introduction and Problem Statement
Why do people emigrate? Most of the research literature in the field of immigration is in search of a
comprehensive answer to this question. Researchers try to examine the determinants of migration at different
levels. They provide conceptual frameworks and a comprehensive view of this matter to draw a multifaceted and
complex picture of international migration. Of course, as (Carling, 2002:5) says, as much as they talk about the
Asian Institute of Research Law and Humanities Quarterly Reviews Vol.3, No.4, 2024
"age of immigration" in today's world, they can talk about the "age of forced settlement." This is partly due to
the fact that most researches focus on the post-immigration phase, that is, the time when a person has reached the
destination country or started his journey. What happens before the migration and what factors affect people's
desire and decision to migrate has been paid less attention.
The desire to migrate is one of the things that has attracted a lot of attention in the migration literature in recent
years. In the definition of this term, someone who has a tendency to migrate is someone who considers migration
preferable to staying [in the country of origin] (Carling and Collins 2017:4).
1: It is an inseparable part of the dynamics of migration in the sense that all those who intend to migrate have a
tendency to migrate, while it is possible that all those who have a tendency to migrate cannot, because existing
obstacles to immigrate; 2. The tendency to migrate can affect the allocation of resources in different ways
(Carling and Collins 2017:1), for example, in developed or poor societies, the few resources that families only
spend on Unsuccessful migrations can lead to the worsening of their situation, while successful migrations
usually reduce poverty and transfer goods with the help of remittances and financial investment in the country of
origin. People move between the countries of origin and destination (Hindman, H.; Oppenheim, R. 2014).
Migration among the people of Afghanistan has a long tradition and forced migrations due to war and Ethnic and
religious repressions and voluntary migrations for the purpose of pilgrimage and education can be witnessed
throughout the historical periods of this country. However, during the last few decades, these continuous flows
of migration and return have taken an unprecedented collective and quantitative form. During the two decades
from 1981 to 2001, about 30 percent of the population of Afghanistan left their country. Only during the 1360s,
more than six million people immigrated from Afghanistan and immigrated to 72 countries (mostly Iran and
Pakistan) (Turton and Marsdin, 2002 and Saito, 2008).
In recent years, political, security and economic crises have increased again, so that in recent years, the highest
rate of non-military casualties has been recorded in the country (UNAMA, 2017) and the economic situation as
well. It would get worse. The mixed nature of many of these displacements points to the various motives of
immigrants and refugees, as well as their individual characteristics, so that now, in addition to fleeing from war
and unrest, factors Others are looking for better job opportunities, education, safety and well-being, escape from
ethnic and religious discrimination, family pressures, etc. (MMC, 2017, Asia Foundation).
Currently, the results show that three out of four people in Afghanistan have experienced internal or
international migration in their lifetime. (ICRC, 2009; Majidi 2017). In such a situation, it is possible to talk
about the formation of "immigration culture" in which, according to (Christiane and el, 2014:499) migration in
society is a natural thing, a kind of habit, instead of will be This culture has been formed over time and with its
dynamics, it keeps influencing the values and behaviors of the people of Afghanistan. It is in this dynamic
framework that the motivations, purposes, mechanisms and patterns of migration change continuously. In
addition, many studies have indicated the importance of the role of support networks and extramili diaspora in
strengthening or weakening migration flows (for example: Sheffer,2003; King and Christo, 2010; Feist, 2010;
Nimkar and Farous 2017), in such a way that, for example, by presenting an ideal image of many destination
countries, they have encouraged many to immigrate and created a desire to immigrate in them.
Moreover, it is possible to highlight the existing restrictions in the destination countries and the difficult living
conditions there and suppress or limit such a desire to migrate. Studies on the causes of migration focus more on
the push and pull factors or the decision-making mechanism for migration and the factors that influence it, and
focus more on the immigrants who have reached their destination or those who are the future of the immigration
program is definite and focused. This causes that there is not much information about the stage before deciding
to migrate; In this sense, why some people have a desire to emigrate, while others do not show such a desire and
prefer to stay over emigration (Creighton, Mathew J. 2013).
Addressing this topic, willingness or unwillingness to migrate, requires finding answers to questions such as:
What level of willingness to migrate exists among the people of a society? What are the social characteristics of
Asian Institute of Research Law and Humanities Quarterly Reviews Vol.3, No.4, 2024
those who show their desire or unwillingness to emigrate? What factors at different levels of micro, medium and
macro affect the level of desire to migrate? Considering the importance of the issue of immigrants and refugees
in today's world and the different policies that the countries of origin, transit and destination take to deal with it,
the answers to these questions can be of importance. It will be a lot of fun. Civil wars, the rich-poor gap, natural
disasters, etc., have created a wave of refugees and asylum-seekers all over the world and created a complicated
situation in which politics is not a simple matter (Gurak, D. T.; Caces, F. 1992).
For example, the failure of many immigration policies of destination countries in keeping asylum seekers away
from their borders is a proof of this claim. This is partly due to the lack of sufficient information about the
different dimensions of these migrations; Including what happens before deciding to migrate. Paying attention to
the pre-decision stage has the advantage that policies focused on the countries of origin will be able to follow
policies at an appropriate level (Abbasi et al. 2016).
In this direction, this article explains the social issue of migration from Afghanistan with emphasis on the
tendencies and supporting factors. In this sense, it uses the survey data, which was part of a larger project about
the decision-making mechanism for migration among the people of Afghanistan. The importance of the present
research is that it focuses on the pre-migration phase and deals with the determinants of the tendency to migrate
at different levels. The main question of the article is: What factors on the macro, medium and micro levels
affect the desire to migrate among the people of Afghanistan?
2. Experience Background
At the beginning of the 21st century, several studies focused on measuring the tendency to migrate and how to
decide to migrate in societies began (for example, Carling, 2002; Papadopoulos and Sianos, 2007, Czaika and
Vatkenchet 2012; Carling 2013, Creighton, 2013) (Timmerman and others, 2014; Estrelkoski and Bilan, 2016;
Carling and Collins 2017, Van Mol and others, 2017); Cairns and others, 2017, Carling and Shull, 2018; May
2018, Schiebelhofer 2018, Collins, 2018. In the international migration research literature, there are few studies
that have focused on the tendency to migrate from the model they have used the second step of
willingness/ability.
Carling (2002) studied a case of emigration from Cape Verde by presenting his two-stage model. In this article,
he examined the link between the desire to migrate with individual characteristics and the migration environment
and tried to answer the question of how potential migrants find the ability to migrate. According to the findings,
each potential immigrant, in order to become a real immigrant, has different abilities and financial and human
capitals, and must overcome various obstacles and challenges. In an article, Carling (2014) examines the nature
and functions of the tendency to migrate in the migration process.
According to his reasoning, desire plays an important role in the whole migration process, although in different
ways. The desire to migrate is a part of a person's general desires in life, so that if other desires are more
important and are fulfilled, the desire to migrate may be pushed aside. Otherwise, emigration is preferred over
staying, and if there is an ability to emigrate, real emigration will take place.
Carling and Shull (2017) in re-examining the willingness/ability model in international migration, address the
theoretical and methodological problems related to this model, for example, how to understand the willingness to
migrate? How can you measure these concepts in experimental studies? And is it possible to say that people who
prefer to stay have the ability to migrate? By examining two-stage models, they try to build a foundation for new
researches in the field of international migration by expanding the theoretical, methodological and experimental
basis.
Carling and Collins (2017) in the study of the tendency to migrate, examine the theoretical approaches to the
concept of the tendency to migrate and examine its relationship with the migration industry.
Asian Institute of Research Law and Humanities Quarterly Reviews Vol.3, No.4, 2024
Also, while examining the relationship between the desire to migrate and the desire to migrate, it analyzes the
meanings and differences in the meanings of various terms used in this field, and further, it analyzes the factors
influencing migration.
Some researchers have also investigated the tendency to migrate in different contexts. Timmerman et al. (2014)
focused on the importance of migration culture in understanding the desire to migrate among Turkish people. By
focusing on two regions with different immigration backgrounds in Turkey (one with a strong immigration
culture and another with a weak immigration culture), he examines the tendency of the residents there to
immigrate to Europe. According to the findings of this research, the desire to migrate to a region that has a
strong culture of migration is lower than another region.
Also, people's perception about the economic opportunities, work and living conditions of immigrants in Europe
has a negative effect on the desire to migrate to the region with a strong migration culture. Venmol et al. (2017)
also investigate the relationship between the migration culture and the desire to migrate in Ukraine's immigration
system. They are looking for an answer to the question of how to explain the tendency of people to migrate to
two different regions with their international networks (family and friends) in the destination countries. The
findings of this research clearly show that the characteristics of regional migration and transnational networks
play an effective role in reducing or increasing migration from Ukraine.
Czaika and Wetkenchet (2014) by analyzing why internally displaced persons are more inclined to than non-
immigrants. For migration in Indonesia, they measure the relationship between migration experience and the
desire to migrate. Based on their findings, the variables of age, education and socio-economic base affect not
only the desire to migrate but also the ability to migrate. In addition, they found that migration, in addition to
being economically beneficial, can cause a greater gap in the willingness to migrate between refugees and non-
migrants.
Strielkowski and Bilan (2016) also studied the perception of Europe among the people of Turkey and Ukraine as
countries of origin and its effect on the desire and decision of potential immigrants to migrate. By examining the
social, structural and socio-cultural determinants, they came to the conclusion that potential immigrants can be
divided into two groups: those who have a positive view of Europe and those who have a negative view of
Europe. They have divided.
This difference depends on factors such as social background and community characteristics. A review of the
research literature on the issue of migration, its motivations and drives show that many studies have investigated
this topic in different conditions. However, what has been ignored in the meantime is considering different
factors at different levels in a single model and analysis. Based on the survey data, this research examines the
effect of independent factors simultaneously, at different micro, macro and medium levels on the tendency to
migrate.
Also, the present research has the advantage of focusing on the stage before the actual migration, something that
has been neglected in the literature on international migration of Afghans so far (Collins, 2018).
3. Theoretical Framework
Traditional approaches to immigration can be divided into two groups: functional and structural (Strielkowski
and Bilan, 2016:19-20), the first group includes approaches such as neoclassical microeconomics and
macroeconomics and focuses on labor force migration.
In these approaches, people immigrate to another economic system based on a rational decision and to obtain a
higher salary (Goss and Lindquist, 1995). In the second group, there is a focus on macro trends that lead to
social inequality among people. In fact, the difference between these approaches and the first group is that the
level of analysis is transferred from individual decisions and actions to social structures. However, these
approaches have faced many criticisms.
Asian Institute of Research Law and Humanities Quarterly Reviews Vol.3, No.4, 2024
For example, regarding the theory of micro-economics, although the unemployment rate of developed and
industrialized countries has been very high in some periods, still immigration to these countries continues.
(Massy et al, 1993), new approaches tried to compensate for these shortcomings. The approach of the new
economy, focusing on the family, considered migration as a family strategy to increase profit and income and
reduce the risks of unemployment (Strielkowski and Bilan, 2016).
The theory of migration systems also added to the analysis the exchange of resources, capital and people
between the countries receiving and accepting immigrants by addressing macro and micro structures. While the
social network theory focuses on the role of transnational networks and direct and indirect communication
between immigrants in the destination country and potential immigrants in the origin country (Massy et al.,
1993, Christiane et al., 2014).
However, these theories alone cannot explain the truth about this multifaceted phenomenon. One of the issues
that are ignored in many approaches is people's perceptions, meaning that due to technological progress and the
expansion of mass communication means, migration distances are shortened and increased Facilitating migration
(such as migrant smuggling networks, labor force employment agencies and cross-border marriages) people in
They are exposed to the concept of migration. Perceptions and attitudes related to immigration are social and
cultural constructs (Christiane et al., 2014: 497), which can be analyzed at different levels.
One of the recent efforts in the direction of explaining people's perception of migration and its effect on
international migration is the use of two-stage models to explain migration. For example, (Carling and Collins
2017) in designing the model of willingness/ability to migrate, say that the pre-migration period is divided into
two stages.
1: Evaluating migration as a possibility, and 2. Finding/not finding migration in a particular moment. Although
these models use different terms such as desire, attitude, desire, intention or need (for example: Alpes, 2014;
Black and Collier, 2014; Carling and Collins, 2017), but they all refer to thoughts and ideas.
According to these models, the desire to migrate may end up in real migration, and it is possible that it does not
end in real migration and the person remains in the original society. As mentioned before, the tendency to
migrate can be defined as the preference of migration to stay. Therefore, people are divided into two general
groups: those who have a desire to emigrate and those who lack this desire.
Among the first group, some have the ability to migrate and their desire leads to real migration. Those who do
not immigrate, or those who have no desire to immigrate, or if they have the desire to immigrate due to their
inability to immigrate (for various reasons), are forced non-immigrants. Carling's willingness/ability to migrate
model is affected by two groups of factors: the environment and conditions of migration at the macro level and
individual characteristics at the micro level (Carling, 2002:12; Carling and Collins 2017:2).
In their model, other factors are added at the middle level, which includes local and transnational networks and
local cultures (Christiane and others, 2014:497).

In the present research, after reviewing the research literature and based on the models of Carling (2002) and
Christiane and, Colleagues (2017) presented a conceptual model to investigate the tendency to migrate among
According to this model, various factors on three levels, macro, micro and medium, affect people's desire to
migrate. At the macro level, the political, economic and social situation of the target countries and the origin of
the main factors have been mentioned. At the micro level, the individual characteristics of individuals are among
the things that cause the difference in the level of desire to migrate. At the middle level, the strength of
transnational networks affects the tendency to migrate.
4. Research Method
The research method of the article is quantitative and based on the sample survey method, and it is based on a set
of data about the decision-making mechanism for migration among the people of Afghanistan, which was
collected in the framework of the MORE research project.
This project aims to understand the influencing factors on the decision-making process of the people of
Afghanistan to migrate abroad, following the collection of quantitative data in two stages. The questionnaire
designed in this project includes four sections: demographic characteristics, tendency to migrate, respondent's
understanding of migration culture, migration intention and influencing factors on the decision-making
mechanism.
The data was collected in April and May 2017 in four provinces of Afghanistan (including Kabul, Herat,
Nangarhar and Kandahar). Access to the respondents was provided using a multi-stage sampling method.
Considering the ratio of 43 percent for migration based on Afghanistan's population survey (Asia Foundation,
2019), the confidence coefficient is 95 percent and the error is 5 percent, the sample size is 652 people, which is
1.3 for an estimated number of samples is about 850 people became:
The dependent variable of this research is the level of desire to migrate, which is a rank scale and with this
question. The survey was decided: if a suitable opportunity is available in the next year, how much would you
like to move abroad? In this way, a three-choice dependent variable was obtained that measures the desire to
migrate (code = 0 means no or little desire to migrate, code = 1 has a moderate desire to migrate, and code = 2
has a strong desire). to immigration).
Asian Institute of Research Law and Humanities Quarterly Reviews Vol.3, No.4, 2024
Another question was asked for the group of respondents who have a tendency to emigrate, based on which
country they prefer as their destination. As mentioned in the conceptual framework section, three groups of
independent variables were considered. The first group is the social characteristics of the individual: gender, age,
marital status, place of residence (city/village), religion, ethnicity, employment status, and education level. The
second group includes two variables: one is the respondent's understanding of the economic, social and political
conditions of Afghanistan, and the other is the respondent's understanding of the economic, social and political
conditions of the destination country. In order to create these two indicators, seven questions were asked about
access to health and medical facilities, job opportunities, educational opportunities, security situation, existence
of discrimination, women's quality of life and men's quality of life. In both countries, the origin and purpose
were asked.
The answers were in the form of a Likert scale and were coded from 0 to 2 (bad, not bad and not good, good).
Then, each person's scores were added to different items and according to the scores obtained, they were placed
in one of three groups. Cronbach's alpha method was used to determine the reliability of the items designed for
the respondent's understanding of the economic, social and political conditions of the country of origin and
destination, and for each of them, the coefficients were 0.78 and 0.78, respectively. 0.74 was obtained.
These coefficients indicate that the statements have an acceptable internal consistency in the measurement of the
mentioned two indicators. In the third group, to measure the index of the strength of transnational networks, two
questions about frequency Annual contacts with family members and friends abroad were asked: Question 1:
How many times do you contact your family members abroad during the year? Second question: How many
times do you call your friends abroad during the year? The answer items are in this order: code 0 = I don't call at
all or finally once or twice a year, code 1 = I call every six to four months, code 2 = I call both or three months,
code 3 = I call every month, code 4 = I call every week.
Here again, after scoring the answers to two questions, the scores were collected and according to the scores
obtained, people were divided into one of the groups of individuals with a weak transnational network,
individuals with an average transnational network, and individuals with A strong transnational network took
place. The obtained alpha coefficient for this index was equal to 0.7. Due to the multivariate nature of the
dependent variable, two bivariate (chi-do) and multivariate (multivariate logistic regression) tests were used to
analyze the effect of independent variables. In the multivariable test, in the first stage, the effect of social factors
was examined. In the second stage, the effect of the variables of the individual's understanding of the conditions
of the country of origin and destination, as well as the transnational network, was measured. Finally, in the third
stage, all these variables were entered into the model.
5. The Findings
The findings of this research indicate that the majority of the respondents are male (71%) and are from the age
groups of 25-25 and 26-35 years old. The ratio of married and single people (50.3% and 49.7%, respectively)
and those who live in the village and city (51.1% and 48.9%, respectively) is almost equal.
In terms of ethnicity, the respondents were selected from among the three main ethnicities of Pashtun, Hazara,
Tajik and other ethnicities (24.1, 26.4, 29.8 and 19.6 percent, respectively). Approximately two-thirds of the
respondents have primary, secondary or secondary education, while 15.6 percent are university graduates. The
rest of the respondents (18.6%) are illiterate and lack any education. One quarter of the respondents are
unemployed and the rest are employed. In terms of socio-economic base, half of the respondents (44.2%) are in
the low level and 37.8% are in the middle level. Only 18 percent of the people have a high level of socio-

As it was said in the research method section, in order to obtain the level of people's desire to migrate, a question
was asked in this regard; Based on the answers received, 58 percent answered that they have a strong desire to
migrate abroad if a suitable opportunity is available, while 22 percent said that they have a desire to migrate to
some extent.
Also, only 20 percent of the respondents did not show any desire to immigrate or their desire to immigrate was
Afghanistan, so it can be safely said that the majority of the people of Afghanistan have the desire to migrate.
However, the purpose of migration is not the same for these people. In response to the question about the
destination they prefer for migration, it became clear that most Afghans have a tendency to migrate regionally,
mainly to neighboring countries. Iran (23%), Turkey (22%) and Pakistan (8%) are the main destinations of
regional migrations.
In terms of extra-regional migrations, European countries are the new destinations where many Afghans have
immigrated or are willing to immigrate in recent years. In the current sample, Germany is counted as the
preferred destination for Afghans in Europe with 19 percent. European countries as a whole are the desired
destination of 38 percent of the respondents. The remaining 12 percent also chose other countries such as the
United States, Canada and Australia.

Asian Institute of Research Law and Humanities Quarterly Reviews Vol.3, No.4, 2024
respondents, the age group of 18-25 years old, singles, millennials and university students have the most desire
to emigrate from the country, while the age group of 46 years and above, married people, Pashtuns and illiterate
people. They have the greatest reluctance to immigrate compared to the rest.
Also, those who misjudge the general situation of Afghanistan and those who have strong transnational
migration networks show a stronger desire to emigrate than the rest. On the other hand, those who evaluate the
country's situation well and those who have weak transnational migration networks show a greater unwillingness
to migrate or a low desire to migrate.

In the multivariate test, since the dependent variable (inclination to migrate) is a multivariate variable, the
reference category of "disinclination to migrate" was considered based on macro, medium and micro level
dependent variables was examined in three models. In model 1, examine the effect of micro-level variables
(population characteristics) and in model 2, the effect of macro-level variables (the respondent's understanding
of the situation of the countries of origin and destination) and medium (strength of transnational migration
networks).
In model 3, the effects of all independent variables were examined. Based on the obtained results, in comparison
with the lack of desire to migrate, the probability of having an average desire to migrate among the age group of
46 years and above is less than that of the age group of 25-18 years, singles are more than married people,
Hazaras and Tajiks More camels than Pashtuns, more universities It is illiterate.
Regarding the probability of having a strong desire to migrate, compared to not having a desire to migrate,
groups 35-26 years old and 46+ years old are less likely to have a strong desire to emigrate compared to the 25-
18 age group. Also, Hazaras and other ethnic groups have a strong desire to migrate more than Pashtuns. People
who have the level of guidance, secondary and university educations are more likely to have a strong desire to
emigrate than illiterate people.
In model 2, the effect of intermediate and macro variables was examined, and based on the results, those who
evaluated the situation in Afghanistan as good or not good or bad were less likely than those who evaluated the
situation badly. The average plateau has a tendency to migrate. Those who have medium (neither strong nor
weak) transnational migration networks are more likely to have a medium level of desire to migrate, compared to
those who have weak transnational migration networks.
In the case of a strong desire to emigrate, the probability of its existence among those who have a good or not-
bad-not-good evaluation of the situation in Afghanistan is less than among those who consider the situation to be
bad. This possibility is more among those who have strong or medium (neither weak nor strong) transnational
networks than respondents with weak transnational migration networks.

Finally, in model 3, all the independent variables were analyzed at the same time so that their effect on the
dependent variable was analyzed. At the small level, the variables of age, marital status, ethnicity, and education
have the greatest effect on the tendency to migrate:
The 46-year-old and above age group is less likely to have a moderate or strong desire to migrate compared to
the 25-18-year-old age group. Moreover, the age group of 35-26 years is less likely to show a strong desire to
emigrate compared to the age group of 25-18 years.
Single people are more likely to show a medium level of desire to migrate compared to married people. Among
ethnic groups, Pashtuns are less likely to migrate than other ethnic groups. Those who have the level of
university, guidance and secondary education have a strong desire to immigrate compared to the illiterate.
(International Committee of the Red Cross, 2009).
At the intermediate level, however, those who have medium transnational migration networks are more likely to
have a medium level of intention compared to those who have weak transnational migration networks. Also,
people with strong and medium transnational migration networks are more inclined than people with
Transnational migration networks show themselves to be weak. At the macro level, evaluation variables from the
country of origin have a significant effect on the dependent variable: those who evaluated the country's situation
as good or not-bad-and-not-good, compared to those who evaluated the country's situation badly have done, the
probability is less who have a strong desire to emigrate.

6. Conclusion
Changing the nature and scale of international migrations and displacements of people across borders is one of
the dynamics and realities of the contemporary world. Now, migrations have become multi-dimensional and
complicated, and in the migration flows, not only economic migrants, but also refugees and asylum seekers,
internally displaced persons, students, etc. are seen. These immigrants usually include all age groups and women
and families have also accompanied them.
In many parts of the world, there is talk of "feminization of migration." In addition, migration routes and
mediators are no longer the same as before. If in the past, migration routes were limited to commercial and
caravan routes, today, with the politicization of the immigration issue and the severity of the government's
deterrent and punitive policies to prevent immigrants from entering Raf" from various paths and hidden from the
eyes of the governments, the only progressive option of many It has been created.
In addition, new legal and illegal mediators have been opened as a facilitator in the migration process; Just like
migrant smuggling networks, employment agencies, family reunification laws, etc. In such a situation, the
management of migration flows has become one of the main priorities of governments and international
organizations.
Encouraging or inhibiting policies at the national and international level always try to encourage migration
through legal channels and prevent irregular migrations, but they are less successful in achieving this goal. The
difficulty is partly due to the changing nature of this phenomenon - which we mentioned earlier - and the return
of one-sidedness in the field of immigration policy.
Most of the policies are generally made in the highly political space and in the direction of achieving the
specific goals of the dominant parties in the immigrant-receiving or immigrant-receiving countries, without
considering the existing realities (Meyer, F.2018).
For example, in most of these political views, an immigrant is seen as a passive individual who lacks willpower,
and economic, political, or social factors pull them this way and that. What is ignored among them is their role in
the migration process and their operations. The same situation can be observed in Afghanistan and related
migration literature. In most of the researches that has been done about the migration of people in Afghanistan,
they focus more on insecurity and war or economic problems as the main drivers of people's migration, not on
facts such as culture Emigration among the people of Afghanistan was noticed.
Migration is a deep-rooted phenomenon among the people of Afghanistan, and today it is rare to find someone
who himself or one of his family members has not had the experience of cross-border migration (Turton and
Marsdin, 2002, Saito, 2008).
In addition, the formation of diaspora and transnational migration networks of Afghanistan in neighboring and
distant countries is an important factor in the strengthening of this culture and the evolution of the daily life of
the Afghan people. It is in such conditions that the issue of "willingness to migrate" is of particular importance.
According to the findings of the present research, in Afghanistan, younger age groups, especially 18 to 25 years
old, unmarried and educated people are more willing to migrate. This finding is consistent with the dimensions
of characteristics in the theory of attraction and repulsion of Everett Lee (1966) and the results of the studies of
Carling (2002) and Czaika and Wetkenchet (2014).
Young people, single and educated people, have more access to technology and social media, and they are faced
with the lack of work and education opportunities. Hazaras are also among the groups that show a strong desire
to emigrate from Afghanistan. However, these are not the only social factors that affect the desire to migrate.
Transnational migration networks are among the factors that have a strong effect on this desire. According to the
findings, the presence of family members in the destination countries or diaspora can play a determining role not
only in the desire to migrate, but also in the entire migration process.
Asian Institute of Research Law and Humanities Quarterly Reviews Vol.3, No.4, 2024
By knowingly or unknowingly giving an ideal image of the destination countries or encouraging their relatives
to immigrate, they increase the desire to immigrate among the people of Afghanistan (Mixed Migration Centre,
2017).
This finding is consistent with the theoretical arguments of social network (1991) and the results of some studies
such as (Stark, O.1991).
However, friendship networks did not show much effect on the desire to emigrate in the present study. Also, at
the macro level, it was found that the people of Afghanistan immigrate more because of their negative attitude
towards the economic, social and political conditions of Afghanistan rather than considering the attractions of
the destination countries. In general, it can be said that in the past three decades, despite the restraining policies
of neighboring countries and Europe to prevent Afghan immigrants from entering their countries, the migration
of Afghans from the country is still going on. About one fourth of the surveyed people have the desire to
immigrate to Iran. In fact, what policies of the Afghan government and what policies of the target governments
have been encountered in this direction (Scheibelhofer, 2017).
This is partly due to the ineffectiveness of the traditional view of the phenomenon of migration in the Afghan
society and the lack of inclusion of its different dimensions in the analyzes and policies. Simplifying the
phenomenon of immigration in Afghanistan, both war and extreme poverty, dooms previous immigration
policies to failure.
Adoption of effective and efficient policies is necessary to take into account the existing realities in the society
of Afghanistan. The immigration culture of the same and the role of the immigrant as an active actor and
independent decision-maker are some of the facts that have been paid less attention so far (Monsutti, 2008).
Not only today, but in the past, migration has affected all aspects of the daily life of the people of Afghanistan.
In fact, as other researches have shown, in Afghanistan, migration can be one of the survival strategies in
difficult periods (Monsutti, 2005), or a special function of people's social life (Monsutti, 2007).
In fact, the desire to emigrate is very high among the people of Afghanistan; In fact, migration has become a
normal thing or a kind of habit. Individual perceptions are also affected by the environment, and then this
environment, due to the presence of the media and technological progress, covers a much larger scope than
before.
In view of such a situation, the prevention of migration and the preventive measures and policies in the
countries. Transit and destination are not only effective and not correct actions, but they make the situation more
difficult for immigrants.
Some of the people who intend to emigrate may give up their decision due to the deterrent measures, but many
others still decide to emigrate and for this purpose, they are forced to use illegal means Tuberculosis migrates to
smuggling networks, which in turn It helps for various dangers and their misuse. Governments and politicians
should first accept migration as a kind of culture among the people of Afghanistan, and then in the next step,
think about managing these displacements. Of course, we should not forget the diaspora and the networks - that
this management will not be very effective without the support and help of the transnational Afghan society.
