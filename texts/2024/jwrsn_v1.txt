HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 3
Abstract
This study explores the HEXACO traits and their correlates among 18-year-olds from Kenya, Namibia,
and South Africa (N = 1,746). Established HEXACO inventories contain culture-specific phrasing and lack
model fit and measurement invariance in African samples. Drawing on the initial maker terms for the
HEXACO, we created new, single-adjective HEXACO scales with good fit and measurement invariance
across the three countries. Evaluating these scales and their correlations with physical and mental
health and religiosity we found that the Honesty, Agreeableness, and Openness scales replicated
findings from North America and Europe, while eXtraversion and Emotionality did not, indicating more
culturally-specific aspects. Our novel method represents a middle path between an imported, etic scale
and a culturally-specific one, demonstrating a promising approach for HEXACO studies across diverse
contexts. Our findings provide a foundation for future research on the HEXACO traits and their
correlates in Sub-Saharan Africa and many other cultural contexts.

HEXACO Personality Traits in Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa
Personality is important to humans worldwide, as indicated by the presence of personality-
related terms in every known language (Dixon, 1982; Saucier, Thalmayer, & Bel-Bahar, 2014).
Substantiating this notion, empirical research consistently demonstrated that personality traits predict
outcomes in practically all relevant life spheres (Ozer & Benet-Martínez, 2006; Soto, 2019). Yet, these
results are mainly based on data from Western1, university-educated samples, which only represent
about 11% of the world’s population (Arnett, 2008; Henrich et al., 2010; Thalmayer, Toscanelli et al.,
2021). Hence, it remains an open question if the same personality traits are equally important for the
same outcomes across cultural contexts.
The HEXACO Traits across Cultures
The HEXACO is a structural model of personality (Ashton et al., 2004; Lee & Ashton, 2006)
including six traits: Honesty/Humility, Emotionality, eXtraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
and Openness to Experience. The model is based on convergent results from lexical studies in seven
languages; Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Korean, Polish (Ashton et al., 2004) and has
therefore been presented as a cross-culturally informed update to the Big Five (Lee & Ashton, 2008;
Saucier, 2009). In line with this, previous studies have suggested that the HEXACO model can be used as
a common framework for cross-cultural comparisons (García et al., 2022; Lee & Ashton, 2008;
Thielmann et al., 2020). The HEXACO is thus a promising candidate for a trait model to use in Sub-
Saharan African contexts.
When using the HEXACO traits outside the Western contexts in which they were developed and
validated, however, it is important to keep in mind that they are imported (etic). This model and its
1 ‘Western’ is an inexact geographical metaphor on a round globe. We use it here to refer to
economically-advantaged Western European countries and English-speaking, majority-European-
heritage countries in North America (Canada and North America) and the Pacific (Australia and New
Zealand).

component traits capture individual differences that were found to be salient and relevant in
predominantly Western contexts. The HEXACO traits might not be as valid in Sub-Saharan Africa
(Behrens, 2004) and might not capture all locally-relevant traits in the region, such as those identified in
indigenous lexical studies (Thalmayer, Job et al., 2021, 2022). Nevertheless, using imported models for
cross-cultural personality research can be practically useful and can potentially advance personality
theory (Thalmayer et al., 2022), for example, by assessing which traits are more or less transferable
across contexts and for differences with respect to how traits are expressed (McCrae, 2000) and how
they develop (Bleidorn et al., 2013). The current study thus focuses on the generalizability of the
HEXACO traits and their predictive validity to African contexts.
The generalizability of personality traits and their correlates across contexts has been the
subject of debate, which has sometimes pitted the extreme of culture-specific traits against that of
universal traits (Allik & Realo, 2017; McCrae & Costa, 1997; Thalmayer et al., 2022). Both of these
extremes are likely rare, however (Allik & Realo, 2017; Fontaine, 2011). Instead, we find it useful to
consider intermediary levels, as summarized by Thalmayer and colleagues (2022). An existential
universal can be explained and translated everywhere, though meaning and associations may vary. For
example, assertiveness may lead to success in competitive cultural contexts but could cause friction
where cooperation is valued over competition. Functional universals have similar meaning and
associations across contexts, but are not commonly used or mentally accessible everywhere. For
example, while local terms for Extraversion were scarce or non-existent in three African languages,
when prompted, interviewees gave consistent examples of extraverted individuals (Thalmayer, Job, et
al, 2021). Rare accessibility universals are equally accessible and used the same way in all contexts, and
according to Fontaine (2011), should have measurement equivalence. Potential candidates are the Big

(Saucier, Thalmayer, Payne, et al, 2014; Saucier, Thalmayer, & Bel-Bahar, 2014; Thalmayer et al., in
press).
Although previous research has convincingly established personality trait-outcome associations,
the majority of this research uses North-American and European samples. An open question is whether
the HEXACO traits are existential, functional, or accessibility universals, that is, the degree to which the
concepts are transferable and their associations with outcome variables generalize across contexts.
Given that personality traits rarely meet the criteria of accessibility universals and that this is complex to
test (similar familiarity, predictive associations and measurement equivalence; Allik & Realo, 2017;
Fontaine, 2011; Thalmayer et al., 2022), we suspect that HEXACO traits fall somewhere between
existential and functional universals. To evaluate this, we adopt a two-step approach: First, we test if
each HEXACO trait can be measured in a psychometrically-sound way within and across three African
contexts. If confirmed, this would suggest that HEXACO traits might be existential universals. However, it
is important to note that this method offers only indirect evidence of existential universality, a thorough
exploration of which would necessitate a bottom-up approach. Instead, our study concentrates on
functional universality, that is, the degree to which correlations between HEXACO traits and outcomes
are consistent across contexts. Consequently, in our second step, we examine to what extent the
HEXACO traits are functionally universal by exploring if established HEXACO-outcome associations
generalize across diverse contexts, with regard to three outcome variables of particular practical
relevance: mental health, physical health, and religiosity.
HEXACO Associations with Mental Health, Physical Health, and Religiosity
In previous meta-analyses, HEXACO traits were related to better mental health and lower levels
of stress and anxiety, with the exception of high Emotionality, which associates with lower mental
health and higher levels of stress and anxiety (Pletzler et al., 2023; Zettler et al., 2020; see also
Strickhouser et al., 2017 for related Big-Five-based evidence).
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 7
Compared to mental health, associations between the HEXACO and physical health tend to be
smaller (Pletzer et al., 2023; Strickhouser et al., 2017), mainly with low Emotionality and high
Conscientiousness (Pletzer et al., 2023). Meta-analytic results indicate a protective effect of Big-Five
Extraversion against mortality (Roberts et al., 2007), suggesting that high eXtraversion might be linked
to better physical health. However, recent evidence is mixed. Stephan and colleagues (2020) found that
Big Five Extraversion was positively associated with self-rated health across eight cohort studies,
whereas two meta-analyses found the relation to be non-significant (Pletzer et al., 2023; Strickhouser et
al., 2017).2
Given that a majority of individuals worldwide identify with a religion (Pew Research Center,
2018), faith plays a substantial role in shaping people’s lives, identities, and values (Tarakeshwar et al.,
2003). Religiosity has been suggested as a potential source of resilience for both mental and physical
health (Berkessel et al., 2021; Kasen et al., 2012; Ronneberg et al., 2016). Previous research has shown
that personality and religiosity are interrelated. Specifically, large scale cross-cultural studies have
indicated that Big Five Agreeableness and Conscientiousness as well as HEXACO Honesty/Humility
robustly predict religiosity across religions and cultural contexts (Aghababaei et al., 2012, 2016; Ashton
& Lee, 2019; Gebauer et al., 2014; Saroglou, 2010).
Generalizability of Personality-Outcome Associations to Sub-Saharan Africa
Although associations between the HEXACO and mental and physical health have not been
tested in Sub-Saharan Africa, related research using other personality models replicates findings from
Western samples. For example, Kinyanjui and Sum (2023) found that higher Big Five Neuroticism and
lower Agreeableness predicted drug use in a sample of Kenyan students, replicating associations
observed in Western samples (Terracciano et al., 2008). Relatedly, Nel et al. (2017) demonstrated that
2 In our preregistration, we hypothesized that eXtraversion would be positively associated with physical
health based on Stephan et al. (2020). New evidence from Pletzer et al. (2023), published after our
preregistration, contradicts this hypothesis.
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 8
lower Emotionality and higher Conscientiousness measured by the South African Personality Inventory
were related to higher well-being among South African emerging adults.
With respect to religiosity, Gebauer et al. (2014) reported that HEXACO-religiosity associations
replicated in South-Africa and Schmitt and Fuller (2015) found that Big-Five-religiosity associations
generalized to a sample consisting of aggregated data from Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Ethiopia, Morocco, South Africa, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, however, they did not report country-
level findings.
These studies suggest that the associations between HEXACO and mental health, physical health
and religiosity in Western samples might generalize to Sub-Saharan Africa, however there are
theoretical reasons and other empirical findings that counter this. It has been argued that cultural
context and personality are inseparably intertwined, for example, through social roles, norms, and
values, as well as socioeconomic, institutional, and political factors, all of which shape or determine the
opportunities for an individuals’ personality expression and development (Bleidorn et al., 2013; Clausen,
1968; Havighurst, 1973; Rentfrow & Jokela, 2019; Vygotsky et al., 1997). Because cultural contexts differ
with respect to which behaviors are rewarded and punished (Hofstede, 2011) personality tendencies
might be differently associated with life outcomes. For example, a study comparing collectivistic (Japan,
Mexico, Ghana) to individualistic samples (United States, Germany) reported that nation moderated
associations between Big Five traits and well-being (Schimmack et al.,2002). With respect to religion,
Ashton and Lee (2019) demonstrated that zero-order correlations between HEXACO traits and religiosity
are more pronounced in more religious compared to non-religious countries (see also Ezirim et al.,
2021). HEXACO-outcome associations might conceivably be weaker in less individualistic cultural
contexts, as the emphasis on personality traits as enduring qualities that characterize a unique individual
is most pronounced in Western countries (Heine, 2012; Henrich, 2020; Singh, 2021). In Sub-Saharan
Africa, behaviour and personality are seen as shaped by social expectations and situational context
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 9
(Triandis et al., 1988, c.f. Oyserman et al., 2002). In contexts with a stronger focus on the situation,
HEXACO-outcome associations could be weaker. Providing initial support for this idea, Kitayama and
Park (2021) found that the well-established association between Conscientiousness and biological
health did not hold in a Japanese sample.
Taken together, existing research does not address whether HEXACO-outcome associations, as
observed in European and North-American samples, are applicable in Sub-Saharan Africa. Testing the
generalizability of these traits and their outcome-associations could enrich personality psychology by
helping to determine which findings represent “universal truths” about personality, and which are
specific to Western, individualistic contexts. This could help untangle basic human tendencies from
society-level factors, which are currently intermingled in current personality trait and life-outcome
research. To address such question, however, researchers are first confronted with challenges in
measuring personality traits in the Sub-Saharan African context.
Measuring the HEXACO in Sub-Saharan Africa
Comparing HEXACO correlates across countries requires cross-culturally comparable scales. The
HEXACO are typically measured with self-rated inventories using short phrases (HEXACO-PI-R, Ashton &
Lee, 2009; HEXACO-PI: Lee & Ashton, 2006; HEXACO-60: Ashton & Lee, 2009; also see Thalmayer &
Saucier, 2014 for the closely related Big Six Questionnaire). Like all the commonly-used Big Five
inventories, the HEXACO scales were originally developed in English, and later translated for use in other
contexts. This approach is problematic because the resulting inventories inevitably include culture-
specific content (e.g., I would be quite bored by a visit to an art gallery; Ashton & Lee, 2009). In addition
complexity in content and grammatical structure pose challenges for translation and cross-context
adaptation (Thalmayer, Saucier et al., 2021). Unsurprisingly, such inventories show poor reliability and
lack validity outside of Western countries (Laajaj et al., 2019; McCrae & Costa, 1997; Schmitt et al.,
2007; Thalmayer et al., 2021; 2022). For example, Thalmayer, Saucier et al., (2021) report very low
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 10
internal consistencies (α =.26 - .53) for a translated Big Six inventory in a sample of Khoekhoe speakers
in Namibia.
Another major challenge in cross-cultural personality assessment is measurement invariance, or
psychometric equivalence across groups (Fischer & Karl, 2019). In other words, do the items of a given
personality inventory measure the same construct in the same manner in different groups? Several
studies have established measurement invariance of HEXACO and related Big Six inventories across
countries (Ion et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2018; García et al., 2022; Thielman et al.; 2020; Thalmayer & Saucier,
2014), but only two of these included samples from Sub-Saharan African. García et al. (2022) tested the
HEXACO-60 in a large cross-national study across 18 countries. Although the six-factor solution replicated
in multigroup confirmatory analysis, results indicated that the factors in the two African samples (Togo
and Senegal) deviated from those in the other countries included in the study Moreover, internal
consistency was lowest in Togo and Senegal.
Another large cross-national study by Thalmayer and Saucier (2014) tested the Big Six
Questionnaire across 33 countries, including three African subsamples. Configural invariance was
established, however, according to some experts, comparison of correlations should only be made
across groups if metric invariance holds (i.e., factor loadings are equivalent across groups; Fischer & Karl,
2019). As we aim to explore and compare correlations of the HEXACO across countries, metrically-
invariant scales are necessary for the current study.
Taken together, previous evidence indicates that existing HEXACO/Big Six inventories are not
well suited for Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, we took a novel approach to assess HEXACO traits that
matches that used in bottom-up lexical studies of personality traits, and that has been proposed for
other types of cross-cultural research (e.g., Romaneo et al., 2023). Specifically, we use single-adjective
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 11
marker items (e.g., shy or cheerful)3 combined with a simple, standardized item stem that makes clear
our interest in characteristic, trait-like tendencies (I tend to [be]…). The marker items administered in
the Africa Long Life Study was derived from the lexical studies originally used to develop the HEXACO
(Ashton et al., 2004; Saucier, 2009, see Cross-Language Six items in Appendix B in Saucier, Thalmayer,
Bel-Bahar et al., 2014). Using these items with a standardized stem avoids many problems associated
with importing inventories (e.g., Thalmayer et al., 2022) while making use of the strength of the
HEXACO: its basis in ubiquitous denominators from globally-diverse lexical research (Ashton et al.,
2004). A recent study in an Italian sample (Romano et al., 2023) demonstrated that single adjective
HEXACO markers have the potential to form scales with excellent psychometric properties. While the
marker items used in their study primarily originated from Italian and English HEXACO studies, and were
intentionally specific to their context of interest, our item set draws on a maximally-diverse range of
data with the intention to provide a basis for equivalently measuring personality traits across global
contexts.
The Present Study
Prior HEXACO literature has two major limitations. First, contexts outside the West are
underrepresented, particularly in studies assessing correlates, which leaves the generalizability of
existing findings inconclusive. Second, the few studies that included samples from Sub-Saharan Africa
used imported personality questionnaires with problematic psychometric properties and reasons to
suspect misunderstanding of item content.
To overcome these limitations, we seek to draw valid comparisons between existing HEXACO
literature and African samples using a rigorous and contextualized approach. Our goal was to create
3 The set of HEXACO marker items administered in the Africa Long Life study contained mainly adjectives
and one verb (boast). While the original item derived from the lexical work by Ashton et al. (2004) was
boastful, the item was modified here to improve understandability based on feedback from local team
members.
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 12
short, measurement-invariant HEXACO marker scales with at least acceptable measurement properties
for use in the Africa Long Life Study and for drawing comparison between samples in Kenya, Namibia,
and South Africa. Our approach was practical, in that we aimed to identify a subset of items from the
original HEXACO item pool best suited as common denominators across the three countries. This
contrasts with a theory-driven approach, which would emphasize construct validity.
To explore to what extent the HEXACO traits are applicable in the three countries in the sense of
existential universals (explainable and translatable), we evaluated the resulting marker scales with
respect to model fit and internal consistency. In addition, we used the resulting marker scales to study
associations between the HEXACO traits and mental health, physical health, and religiosity within and
between the countries. To test the HEXACO traits for functional universality, we examined if these
associations correspond to those found in previous meta-analyses and large-scale studies based on
nine hypotheses to predict the relationships between each trait and the outcome (sub-)scales, we
specified only two hypotheses for Openness. This decision was informed by prior research, which
suggests that Openness holds limited predictive validity in relation to the outcome variables selected for
this study (see Ashton & Lee, 2019; Zettler et al. 2020).

and life stress) from which the p-factor is derived. In addition, we did not preregister separate hypotheses for religious activity and intrinsic
religiosity because we initially planned to use the DUREL Religiosity index as an overall indicator of religiosity.

Methods
To answer our research questions, we used data from the first and second waves (W1 and
W2) of the Africa Long Life Study (ALLS), a longitudinal study on emerging adults in Kenya, Namibia, and
South Africa in which co-investigators from each country helped shape the research questions,
materials, and recruitment protocols (Thalmayer et al., 2024).
We report all manipulations, measures, and exclusions in these studies. The hypotheses and
we clearly indicate all deviations from our preregistration. All data and research materials, including the
codebook, the anonymized dataset, and the R scripts are available at
Participants
In each of the three countries, 18-year-old participants were recruited in 2022 for a 5-year
longitudinal study with two data-collection waves per year. The inclusion criteria were the ability to read
English, to read the informed consent letter, to consent to participate in the study, and to provide
detailed contact information to be reached six months later.
Because we used HEXACO items from both W1 and W2, we only included participants whose
surveys at the two time points could be linked (N = 2,158) and who provided personality information
(140 participants from Kenya, 234 from Namibia, and 38 from South Africa did not provide any response
to the HEXACO item at Wave 1) The resulting analytical sample of N = 1,746 (M = 18.24, SD = 0.82) is

HEXACO
The HEXACO marker items administered in the ALLS were based on the original work to develop
the HEXACO model (Ashton et al., 2004), specifically Saucier’s (2009) identification of adjectives that
recurred in the majority of the six languages investigated (Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, Italian,
Korean, and Polish), each of which loaded prominently on one HEXACO factor. This led to a set of 78
items (see Appendix B in Saucier, Thalmayer, Bel-Bahar et al., 2014) that according to Saucier (2009) can
be interpreted as relatively-ubiquitous HEXACO markers and therefore have optimal potential to form
measurement-invariant scales across cultural contexts.
In order to select a subset of the 78 English-language items that would be understood by
participants in Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa, ALLS co-investigators and research assistants from the
three countries reviewed the list and identified terms that were unknown to them and/or likely to be
unknown to most 18-year-olds in their countries. Items were excluded if multiple colleagues from more
than one country classified them as not understandable. The resulting item set contained 56 marker
which meant a one-to-six-month interval between the responses. At both waves, the instruction was:
How accurate is each statement in describing your typical behavior or attitudes. Do you tend to (be)…?.
W1 personality adjectives were shown joined to the item stem: I tend to be…, whereas W2 personality
adjectives were shown preceded by only the ellipsis “…”, with the stem provided at the top of the list.
The 6-point response scale ranged from 1 (very inaccurate) to 6 (very accurate). To accommodate
potential language comprehension issues, an alternative response option, “I do not know this word”,
was available. “I do not know this word” responses are coded as 777 in the dataset, and were treated as
NAs in all subsequent analyses.

Correlates
We included measures of mental health, physical health and religiosity as potential correlates of
the HEXACO traits, all of which were assessed at W1.
Mental Health. Mental Health was assessed with the International Mental Health Assessment
(IMHA, Thalmayer et al., 2023). The IMHA provides hierarchical information on three levels. First, a P-
Factor of general psychopathology reflects an individual’s level of overall dysfunction and proneness
towards disorder (Caspi et al., 2014; Conway, 2019). Second, broad spectra describe an individual’s
inclination to: experience internal emotions, as reflected by anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 20
stress (internalizing tendencies); to direct their emotions outwardly, in the form of substance (ab)use
and anger issues (externalizing tendencies); and to be currently experiencing life difficulties including
sleep problems, life stress, interpersonal and partner conflict, and work disengagement (life difficulties).
On the third and lowest level are nine subscales (Depression, Anxiety, Substance Use/Abuse, Anger,
Sleep Problems, Life Stress, and Interpersonal and Partner Conflicts) rated in terms of frequency
experienced over the last month (1: not in the last month or never to 7: daily or almost daily). We
computed mean scores for P-factor, Externalizing and Internalizing Spectra, and all subscales with higher
scores representing lower levels of mental health.
Physical Health. Physical Health was measured with the single item general self-rated health
(GSRH; DeSalvo et al., 2006), using the query In general, would you say your health is... rated on a 5-
point scale from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). We inverted the responses so that high scores reflect high
levels of physical health.
Religiosity. Religiosity was assessed with the five-item Duke University Religion Index (DUREL;
Koenig & Büssing, 2010), which was originally designed to measure three dimensions of religiosity and
religious involvement: organizational religious activity, non-organizational religious activity, and intrinsic
religiosity (or subjective religiosity indicated by for example experiencing a “presence of the Divine”).
Different response scales were used across the five items, items related to religious activities were
answered on a response scale ranging from 1 (rarely or never) to 6 (more than once a day), response
options for intrinsic religiosity ranged from 1 (definitely untrue) to 5 (definitely true). Wording of the
original scale was adjusted for applicability in the Sub-Saharan African Context (see the codebook
an extensive cross-cultural study (Toscanelli et al., 2022) suggest that organizational religious-activity
(attending religious services/meetings) and non-organizational religious activity (spending time
meditating or praying) can be combined into a single religious activity factor with the resulting two-
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 21
factor structure capturing individual differences in religiosity better in many countries including Kenya
and Namibia (Toscanelli et al., 2022).Therefore, we used the sum scores across all corresponding items
for both of these subscales for all subsequent analyses.
Control Variables
Home Language. Home language was assessed at W1 with an open answer, the item wording
was adjusted to local norms. To maintain anonymity, we grouped languages into broader language
family categories (see Thalmayer et al., 2024, for details).
Gender. Gender was assessed though the item What is your gender? At W1. Response options
were Female (coded as 0), Male (coded as 1), and Other (coded as 2).
Socioeconomic Background. Socioeconomic background was measured through the Family
Affluence Scale (FAS II, Boyce et al., 2005) at W1. The FAS II is a commonly used measure of family
affluence or socioeconomic status among adolescents. It includes four indicators of material family
wealth (unshared bedroom, household car ownership, number of computers in household, number of
family holidays). Response options ranged from 0 (no/none/never) to 2 (two/twice) or 3(more than
two/more than twice). Responses were summed for an overall score.
Analyses
Analyses were preregistered on OSF
4) in order to create scales that were measurement invariant across the three samples. For this purpose,
we used an item-selection algorithm (Schultze, 2017). Second, measurement invariance of the resulting
scales was established through multigroup confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). Based on this, we made
some adjustments to the item composition of the scales. Third, we evaluated the final scales in each
country in terms of model fit and reliability. Fourth, we used the scales to compute correlations
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 22
between the HEXACO traits and mental health, physical health, and religiosity in each country. We then
compared the correlational patterns to hypotheses derived from in existing literature, mainly based on
Western samples.
Item Selection
Item Selection from the Initial Item Pool due to Redundancy and Missingness. Before applying
the item-selection algorithm, we removed items from the initial item pool according to preregistered
criteria. Specifically, to avoid redundancy in the resulting scales, we checked if any of the items from the
HEXACO item pool were intercorrelated at r ≥ |.80|. In addition, we checked if items should be excluded
due to systematic missingness. Participants had the option to respond with I don’t know this word. This
might lead to values not missing at random (NMAR) which in turn can bias the maximum likelihood
estimation’s results. To prevent this, we checked for items with more than 25% “I don’t know this word”
responses. Moreover, we aimed to exclude items for which the I don’t know this word answer was
correlated to a meaningful extent with home language and socioeconomic background. However, due to
the high number of home languages present in the data (55 total), assessing the association with
missingness was not feasible.
Brute Force Item-Selection Algorithm. Within the resulting item pool, we applied an item-
selection algorithm in order to select an optimal subset of items per HEXACO trait with the potential to
be measurement invariant across countries. Using a selection algorithm bears the advantage of
simultaneously evaluating psychometric properties and overall model parameters such as model fit.
Previous studies successfully applied similar strategies to create cross-cultural measurement invariant
personality scales (Jankowsky et al., 2020). We applied the bruteforce algorithm from the stuart R
package (Schultze & Schüller, 2022) to test and compare all possible item subsets per scale. We
constrained the bruteforce algorithm to select five items per scale to provide construct coverage (Soto &
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 23
John, 2018), and to identify the (close-to) optimal solution in terms of model fit and reliability when
metric invariance is assumed.
Due to attrition and surveys that could not be matched between waves 1 and 2, our analytic
sample was smaller than expected. This forced us to deviate from our preregistered analytic strategy:
Initially, we planned to perform simple cross-validation by randomly splitting our sample into two halves
to obtain a training sample for the item selection algorithm and a holdout sample to evaluate the
resulting scales in terms of measurement invariance (Olaru et al., 2019). However, some of the models
derived from the item selection in the test sample did not converge in the holdout sample, potentially
due to the reduced sample size which might have impacted the robustness of item selection and the
resulting model parameters. Therefore, we applied Monte Carlo Cross Validation instead (Picard & Cook,
1984), randomly extracting 50 subsamples (with replacement), each comprising half the size of the total
sample. Subsequently, we applied the item-selection algorithm in each of these subsamples. In the final
step, we chose the subset of items for each trait that showed the highest frequency of occurrence
across the 50 iterations.
Measurement Invariance
We evaluated the item sets with the highest frequency of occurrence across the 50 iterations
with respect to measurement invariance in the full sample. This allowed us to make use of the full
sample while avoiding overfitting. Measurement invariance of the marker scales was established
through multigroup confirmatory factor analysis using the lavaan (Rosseel, 2012) and semTool
(Jorgensen et al., 2022) R packages (R version 4.3.1). This was done separately for each trait. To identify
models, we applied effects coding to the item loadings. That is, we constrained the factor loadings of the
items for each HEXACO trait to average one (Card & Little, 2007). We did not reverse score any items
before estimating the measurement models, in order to explore the direction of the loadings freely. This
is important because the items have never been used in our study population, hence a priori hypotheses
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 24
regarding the direction of loadings were not justified (but see Saucier, 2009, who reports item loading
directions for other populations). Missing data was handled using full information maximum likelihood
estimation.
To test configural measurement invariance, we first estimated a model where loadings and
intercepts were allowed to vary between countries for each trait. In these initial configural models,
some items had incongruent loading patterns across countries; in other words, positive loadings on the
trait in one country and negative loadings in another. Because metric invariance requires equal factor
loadings across countries, we removed items with incongruent loading patterns. We then compared the
change in CFI of three increasingly restrictive measurement models for each trait; configural, metric
(factor loadings constrained to equality), and scalar (factor loadings and intercepts constrained to
equality). According to pre-registered criteria, we used a cutoff of .01 for the change in CFI between
models (Cheung & Rensvold, 2002) as our criterion for retaining a more restrictive model.
Evaluation of the Final HEXACO Marker Scales
The final scales were evaluated by assessing scale properties of the configural measurement
models in each country. We used the CFI and RMSEA in each country as indicators of model fit.
Hopwood and Donnellan (2010) found that many personality models do not meet standard fit
benchmarks, even when they are administered in the cultural contexts they were derived from.
Therefore, we adopted their relatively liberal cutoffs as more reasonable than benchmarks derived in
other domains: CFI > .90 and RMSEA < .10. We computed Mc Donald’s ω as an indicator of the scale’s
reliability and consider an ω ≥ .70 as sufficient (see also Jankowsky et al., 2020; Olaru et al., 2019).
Correlations with Mental Health, Physical Health, and Religiosity
For each of the resulting HEXACO marker scales we computed separate mean scores per
country. Items with negative loadings in the multigroup CFA were reversed before computing mean
scores. HEXACO mean scores were used to compute bivariate correlations between the HEXACO and the
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 25
mean scores for mental health, physical health, and religiosity. We then assessed if the correlations in
.01). A sensitivity power analysis conducted in G*Power 3.1 indicated that the smallest of the three
country-subsamples used in this study (n = 503 , South Africa) would provide 99.82% power to detect a
trait-outcome correlation with an r of .23, assuming a two-tailed test and an alpha of .01. For reference,
Soto (2019) reported a mean effect size of .23 across 78 previously published trait outcome associations.
Hence, our analytical sample should be sufficiently powered to test the hypothesized trait-outcome
associations.
Because previous studies have indicated that country differences in personality correlates could
partly be attributable to gender and social position (García et al., 2022; Zettler et al., 2020), we also
controlled for gender and family affluence in our analyses. To do so, we regressed each outcome
variable on one personality trait, gender, and family affluence as predictors. These additional

Results
We aimed to establish measurement-invariant HEXACO marker scales in Kenya, Namibia, and
South Africa to compare HEXACO-outcome correlations between the three countries. In the following
subsections, we describe the HEXACO marker scales that were developed based on the item-selection
algorithm, we present the results of measurement invariance testing and the correlations between the
HEXACO trait scales and the outcome variables.
Item Selection from the HEXACO Item Pool
According to preregistered criteria, we removed items from the initial HEXACO item pool to
obtain psychometrically-sound scales. We excluded three items because more than 25% of participants
indicated not knowing the words (solitary, mild, industrious). We excluded four items because their not-
known responses were correlated with socioeconomic background at r ≥ .|10| and p < .01 (vulnerable,
introverted, hot-headed, and precise). All items were intercorrelated below .80, therefore, no items had
to be removed due to redundancy.
We applied the bruteforce item selection algorithm to the adjusted pool of 49 items, resulting in
which the selected item set for each trait emerged ranged from six to 28 out of a possible total of 50.4

E brave, emotional, independent, self-assured, strong

For the Openness scale, two item sets with the same number of iterations (six) emerged. We evaluated
both sets through multigroup CFA and chose the one which was measurement invariant across
countries. The other item set was non-invariant because it included one item (ironic) which loaded in
different directions across groups.

Note. We applied the item selection algorithm 50 times in randomly selected halves of the sample and
chose the item combination which emerged most frequently across the 50 runs. Items in italics were
removed due to inconsistent loading patterns across the three samples.
Measurement Invariance of the HEXACO Marker Scales
We computed a multigroup CFA for each trait to explore the loading patterns of the items
selected through the bruteforce algorithm. This allowed us to identify items with inconsistent loading
patterns across countries, which might lead to non-invariance. Based on the results, we removed three
items with inconsistent loadings: Sly loaded positively on Honesty/Humility in Namibia (λ = 0.14, p =
.506), but negatively in Kenya (λ = -0.62, p = .005) and South Africa (λ = -0.77, p = .042); shy loaded
negatively on eXtraversion in Kenya (λ = -0.90, p = .009) and South Africa (λ = - 1.45, p < .001), but
positively in Namibia (λ = 0.53, p = .085); irritable loaded negatively on Agreeableness in Kenya (λ = -
1.219, p = .001), and South Africa (λ = -0.25, p = .326), but positively in Namibia (λ = 0.11, p = .616).
We used these adjusted scales including 27 total items for all subsequent analyses. That is, we
again computed a multigroup CFA for each trait with the adjusted scales. To test for measurement
invariance, we compared three increasingly restrictive measurement models with the multigroup CFA.
Based on the configural model for each HEXACO trait, we obtained item loadings and indicators of
model fit and internal consistency.
Model fit and comparisons of the models with different equality constraints are displayed in
both only reached configural invariance. Even though the criterium for metric invariance (CFI Δ < .01)
was not reached for eXtraversion and Emotionality, the metric measurement models for these traits
demonstrated satisfactory fit according to our prespecified criteria (RMSEA < .10, CFI > .90).

Factor loadings obtained from the configural measurement models with the adjusted scales for
eXtraversion in all three countries, in contrast to negative loadings in prior studies (Ashton, 2004;
Saucier, 2009). Similarly, while emotional, loaded positive on Emotionality in prior studies (Ashton, 2004;
Saucier, 2009), it loaded in the opposite direction in our samples. Post-hoc analyses (not preregistered)
indicated that the unexpected item loadings of emotional and passive were not caused by specific
response pattern (Supplement B) The loading patterns for all other items were congruent with prior
evidence (Ashton, 2004; Saucier, 2009).

Note. Loadings and intercepts were estimated freely across countries. To identify our models, we
applied effects coding to the item loadings, i.e., we constrained the factor loadings of the items for each
HEXACO trait to average one (Card & Little, 2007). This led to reversed item loadings for Emotionality
and Conscientiousness because these marker scales consist of mainly reverse-keyed items. As indicated
by the (R) next to Emotionality and Conscientiousness, high item loadings represent low trait levels.

Conscientiousness items were reverse-keyed whereas the Honesty/Humility and Agreeableness and
Openness marker scale only include forward-keyed indicators. Note, that for Openness, the original item
pool only included positively-keyed items, but for Honesty/Humility, eXtraversion, Agreeableness, and
multigroup CFAs with the adjusted scales revealed good to satisfactory fit (CFIs > .954, RMEAs < .077),
with the exception of Conscientiousness, which fit poorly in the Namibian subsample (CFI in Namibia =
the countries), particularly for eXtraversion (Kenya: ω = .51; Namibia: ω= .31; South Africa: ω = .65). In
contrast, Openness was the scale with the highest internal consistency (Kenya: ω = .68; Namibia: ω =
.69; South Africa: ω = .67).

Correlations with Mental Health, Physical Health, and Religiosity
After establishing measurement invariance, we used the final items set of each HEXACO trait to
compute the corresponding marker scale scores to further examine associations between the HEXACO

traits and the outcome measures of mental and physical health and religiosity in every country. Before
computing the HEXACO mean scale scores, we recoded all Emotionality and Conscientiousness items
and items with negative loadings so that higher mean scores reflect higher levels of the trait. The

common recommendations (e.g., Fischer & Karl, 2019), is required for comparing correlations across

Overall, the personality-outcome correlations were of small to medium magnitude (IrI range =
.00 - .23, IrI average = .08). The correlational patterns were congruent across countries in that we found
no correlations to be significantly positive in one country and significantly negative in another. Twenty-
seven of the 42 hypothesized correlations were observed in at least one sample. Most of the observed
associations in Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa were in line with theory and previous findings from
mostly Western samples, although some did not reach the pre-registered significance level of p < .01 in
one or more of our country samples. A schematic display of hypothesized and observed correlations can
In Kenya and Namibia, Honesty/Humility was associated with higher levels of mental health
(IMHA), that is, Honesty/Humility correlated negatively with the IMHA p-factor (Kenya: r = -,18 p < .001;
Namibia: r = -.11, p = .005) and the Interpersonal Conflict subscale (Kenya: r = -.16 p < .001; Namibia: r =
-.07, p = .063). Also in line with our hypothesis, we found a significant positive association between
Honesty/Humility and religious activity in Kenya (Kenya: r = .23, p < .001; Namibia: r = .04, p = .329,
South Africa: r = .07, p = .115).
Emotionality had fewer significant associations than expected, among the hypothesized
associations, only a negative correlation with Intrinsic Religiosity in Namibia (r = -.13, p = .001) and a
negative correlation with physical health in South Africa (r = -.12, p = .008) were significant. Contrary to
our hypotheses, Emotionality was not linked to mental or physical health in either of the other
countries.
As expected, higher eXtraversion levels were related to higher substance abuse (r = -.16, p = .<
001), and lower life stress (r = -.12, p = .008), anxiety (r = -.14, p < .001), and depression (r = -.21, p=
.001) in South Africa. The hypothesized positive association between eXtraversion and physical health
was also confirmed in South Africa (r =. 18, p < 001). But eXtraversion-mental and physical health
correlations were non-significant and close to zero in Kenya and Namibia.
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 34
Corroborating our hypotheses, high Agreeableness was consistently associated with lower
scores on anger, substance abuse, and externalizing problems in Kenya and Namibia (rs between -.17 -
.10, ps between <.001 and .008) and higher levels of religiosity in all three countries. Notably,
Agreeableness was not significantly related to any outcome variables in South Africa.
As expected, high Conscientiousness was related to lower overall mental health problems and
externalizing problems (rs btween -.18 and -.14, ps between < .001 and .002) in all three countries. Also
in line with our hypotheses, Conscientiousness was positively related to both intrinsic and extrinsic
religiosity in Keya and South Africa (rs btween .12-and .15, ps between .001 and .005).
Openness was linked to better mental health across the three countries, however, we did not
find the hypothesized negative associations with life stress and anxiety. In Kenya and South Africa, high
Openness was significantly associated with higher physical health (Kenya: r = .17, p <.001; South Africa: r

Post Hoc Analyses (not Preregistered)
Because the Emotionality and eXtraversion scales were problematic (lack of metric invariance,
incongruent and contradictory item loadings), we explored if we could create scales with better
psychometric properties and measurement invariance for these traits, drawing from the items chosen
address the pragmatic need for usable scales in the ALLS specifically, and for testing in other samples
generally. To do this, we identified the items included in the three most frequently selected item sets
across the 50 runs, and explored if we could combine them into better scales for these two traits
separately. This approach offers more flexibility compared to our original, algorithm-based item-
selection approach, which relies on a prespecified number of items per scale. Detailed results are

reported in Supplement B. For Emotionality, the resulting scale fit worse than the original scale selected
through the item selection algorithm bur was metrically invariant and had satisfactory internal
consistency. The new Emotionality scale showed some of the expected negative associations with
mental and physical health, however, most of these associations were not significant across all three

analyses.

Discussion
Previous research has established many meaningful personality-trait-life-outcome associations
(Ozer & Benet-Martínez, 2007; ; Soto, 2019). These results, however, are mainly based on data from
Western countries, which represent a small proportion of the world’s population. The present study
extended research with the HEXACO personality traits to three Sub-Saharan African countries. To
address the challenges faced when exporting established inventories to different cultural contexts, we
created short, measurement-invariant HEXACO marker scales suitable for cross-cultural comparisons
and tested their suitability and comparability across Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa. We then used
these marker scales to explore differences and similarities in life-outcome correlates across the three
countries and compared them to what has been established in the West. A major strength of our project
was that study materials and methods were developed and contextualized by a collaborative team of
scholars from the countries of study (Thalmayer et al., 2024). Our results allow us to draw conclusions
on how to best measure the HEXACO traits in three African countries, scales which can plausibly be used
in other l contexts. These findings also provide preliminary insights into which HEXACO/Big Six and
related Big Five traits may be more universally applicable and which may be more context specific.
Measuring the HEXACO Traits with Marker Scales in Sub-Saharan Africa
Although prior studies have highlighted difficulties related to exporting personality models and
inventories, especially to majority-world contexts, our results indicate that it is possible and practically
useful to identify a set of items representing the best “cross-culturally common denominator” for each
HEXACO trait. Most of our marker scales fit remarkably well based on standard benchmarks (Hu &
Bentler, 1999). This is noteworthy given that personality models tend to have poor CFA fit, even within
the populations in which they were developed (Hopwood & Donnellan, 2010), and that model fit is often
worse outside Western countries (García et al., 2022; Lajaaj et al., 2019; Thalmayer et al., 2022). Here,
measurement invariance tests indicate that the basic organization of the latent variables measured
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 37
through our marker scales is similar across the three countries (Fischer & Karl, 2019). This does not
imply that personality traits naturally organize in a uniform structural model across and within these
contexts, as we did not compare models or use an approach that developed local structures from the
ground up (e.g., Thalmayer, Rotzinger, et al., 2023). However, the scales we developed form a solid
basis for making some types of cross-cultural comparisons with regards to commonly-used personality
traits.
The fact that the highest level of invariance reached in our study was metric aligns with prior
cross-national studies of personality scales (Dong & Dumas 2020). Our Emotionality and eXtraversion
marker scales performed slightly worse than results reported for the HEXACO-100 and the HEXACO PI-R
across large cross-national samples, where metric invariance was established based on multigroup CFA
(Lee et al., 2018; Thielmann et al., 2020). But these studies did not include samples from Africa. Prior
studies of HEXACO questionnaires such as the HEXACO-60 and the Big Six Questionnaire including
African samples have only achieved configural invariance (García et al., 20225; Thalmayer, Saucier, et al.,
2021; Thalmayer & Saucier, 2014). For Emotionality, at least, metric invariance was established in our
post-hoc analyses, leading us to conclude with scales for five of the six traits that work as well in and
across these African contexts as has been found for the full inventory in contexts less culturally-distant
from the HEXACO’s origin.
Internal consistency did not meet our prespecified cutoff value and was substantially lower than
established HEXACO scales tested in other contexts (see Ion et al., 2017 and Thielmann et al., 2020 who
report moderate to high internal consistencies for the HEXACO-100 and the HEXACO-60 in Asia and
Europe). However, in comparison to previous work testing HEXACO/Big Six scales in Sub-Saharan Africa,
our marker scales have comparable (García et al., 2022) or better (Thalmayer, Saucier, et al., 2021)
5 Note that García et al. (2022) partly applied different criteria to assess measurement invariance. When
judged based on the Δ, CFI <.01 criterium which we applied, configural invariance is reached for all
scales.
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 38
internal consistency. Because our study used cross-sectional self-report data, we focused on assessing
reliability through measures of internal consistency. Importantly, low internal consistency does not
imply that our marker scales are not reliable per see; to obtain a full picture, additional reliability
parameters are necessary (e.g., interrater reliability, test-retest reliability).
Taken together, our findings indicate that our HEXACO marker scales may be better suited for
assessing common, broad personality traits in Sub-Saharan Africa than other available options, including
established Big Five and Big Six/HEXACO inventories. Using single adjective marker items with a
standardized stem instead of short phrases avoids some of the challenges that occur when personality
inventories are imported (Thalmayer et al., 2022). This approach has promising applicability and
potential generalizability to other cultural contexts (Romano et al., 2023).
More Universal? Honesty/Humility, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness
Our findings suggest that some HEXACO traits may be more cross-culturally transferable than
others: for Honesty/Humility, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness we established metric
invariance across Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa, indicating that the understanding and expression of
these concepts is similar across the three countries as well as to Western contexts. Moreover,
associations between Honesty/Humility, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness with
outcome criteria were similar to what has been reported in other cultural contexts, indicating that these
traits are to some extent functionally universal. Specifically, our findings are in line with Aghababaei and
colleagues (2016) who reported positive associations between Honesty/Humility, Agreeableness,
Conscientiousness, and religiosity (but see also Silvia et al., 2014). And our results confirm earlier work
indicating that Conscientiousness is important for physical health (Pletzer et al., 2023; Stephan et al.,
2020; Strickhouser et al., 2017), and consistently related to lower levels of overall mental problems (p-
factor) and externalizing tendencies across the three countries (Zettler et al., 2020).
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 39
Some cultural differences also emerged for these three HEXACO traits, putting some limits on
their status as functionally universal. First, most of the correlates were only significant in one or two of
the three country samples, indicating that the nomological net of each trait may differ across these
contexts. Second, incongruent loading patterns of the Honesty/Humility item sly and the Agreeableness
item irritable between Namibia and Kenya/South Africa indicate potential differences in the
organization of these traits. These items were dropped in the final scales, nevertheless, we now turn to
discussing their incongruent loadings to gain a more fully understanding of the cross-cultural
applicability of the corresponding traits. One explanation could be the high diversity in ethnicity,
languages, geographical, and sociopolitical conditions between the contexts, which might be related to
personality differences, or differences in the familiarity, valence, or typical usage of these terms. On the
other hand, differences could be due to measurement challenges in a context where survey research is
even less familiar, especially with regard to less-familiar terms such as sly and irritable. This is in line
with our finding that the differences were mainly for Namibia, which is the most rural and least
industrialized among the three countries and had the highest proportion of participants who indicated
not knowing some personality words administered in the study. Kenya and South Africa have more
similarities in contextual factors such as higher levels of urbanization, industrial development, and
possibly closer socio-economic conditions, although Namibia and South Africa share a colonial history
and have closely associated economies and national cultures. Given the diversity in the ALLS samples,
however, it seems fair to be more surprised by the high congruency of so many terms across the
samples and in comparison to the West, than by finding some differences.
To better understand the contradictory and incongruent item loadings, we conducted a small
anonymous post hoc survey of ALLS research assistants, knowing that these respondents would be older
and significantly more educated than ALLS participants, but come from similar backgrounds.
Respondents from Kenya (n = 19), Namibia (n = 10), and South Africa (n = 9) reported whether they
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 40
know and use these adjectives to describe people and explained the behaviors that would make them
describe a person with these adjectives using an open-ended response format. Results indicated that
the contradictory loadings of sly and irritable could have been caused by lack of familiarity and
misunderstandings regarding these items. Detailed results are reported in Supplement B.
All in all, our results suggest that Honesty/Humility, Openness, and Agreeableness fall into the
category of existential universals, with some functionally universal aspects. They encompass aspects of
individual variation that are shared across diverse cultural contexts in that most marker items are
associated with the same underlying trait in a similar manner, but the predictive role of Agreeableness
did not generalize to South Africa. Moreover, the predictive role of Openness has yet to be tested, using
a broader set of outcome variables that have been reported to be more closely related to this trait (e.g.,
creativity, political attitudes, see Zettler et al., 2020).
More Culturally-specific? Emotionality and eXtraversion
For Emotionality and eXtraversion we found more cross-cultural divergences, suggesting that
these traits are understood more differently across the three countries and compared to the West, and
may be more sensitive to contextual factors. For example, our marker scales only reached configural
invariance (see also García et al., 2022 for similar results indicating that the eXtraversion facet of social
self-esteem is non-invariant across diverse countries). However, we were able to establish a metric-
invariant scale for Emotionality in a post hoc analysis, and this scale demonstrated some of the
anticipated associations with mental and physical health, albeit with some differences across countries.
These findings suggest that Emotionality may belong with the group above, including both functionally
and existentially universal aspects. The expected associations between the initial Emotionality scale and
mental health (e.g., Pletzer et al, 2023; Zettler et al., 2020) could not be consistently confirmed in the
ALLS samples, with one likely reason being a surprising mixture of item associations. Individuals in the
ALLS who scored high on the Emotionality marker scale described themselves as less brave and
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 41
independent but, surprisingly, also as less emotional, at least in Namibia (the loading direction was the
same in Kenya and South Africa, yet the loadings did not reach significance). In our post hoc query to
research assistants, we found that all were familiar with and use the term emotional. . A few responses
indicated a fully positive understanding of the word, a clue to an interpretation that may have been
more common among our younger and less educated participants, and would explain the “backwards”
association of this term with its scale.
The eXtraversion scale could not be successfully improved, and thus simply appears to be less
transferable to these contexts and thus more culture-specific to the West. Previously well-replicated
associations between high eXtraversion and better mental health (Zettler et al., 2020) and physical
health (Stephan et al., 2020, but see also Pletzler et. al, 2023) only held in South Africa in the present
study. Incongruent loading patterns of the eXtraversion marker scale compared to prior findings align
with studies highlighting difficulties in applying this concept outside of Western contexts, as described
below. Individuals with high scores on eXtraversion in all three contexts described themselves as more
cheerful, sociable, and talkative, but, surprisingly, also as more passive, which has heretofore been a
reverse-scored indicator in the HEXACO framework. We also had to exclude shy due to incongruent
loadings across countries. In our post hoc query to research assistants, most reported familiarity with
and use of these words, and open answers indicated the theoretically-expected understanding of low
eXtraversion. Thus, we did not gain any insights into the unexpected self-descriptions among ALLS
participants. Future work with ALLS participants or other younger and less educated participants in
these countries will be needed to clarify if these terms (shy, passive) are used in meaningfully different
ways.
Drawing definitive conclusions about the aspects of eXtraversion that are consistently
understood across cultural contexts, as opposed to those aspects where manifestations and perceived
meanings differ, remains challenging. Our results support the notion that the concept of eXtraversion is
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 42
less applicable in less-individualized, rural contexts, characterized by lower relational mobility (Yuki &
Schug, 2012) and fewer interactions with strangers (Thalmayer, Job, et al., 2021). Corroborating this
idea, prior research has demonstrated that indigenous languages in Africa, including some spoken in
Namibia and Kenya, have few personality-adjectives related to Extraversion, which indicates that making
distinctions in this domain has not been historically relevant in these contexts (Thalmayer et al., 2020;
Thalmayer, Job et al., 2021). There is also indicator that the associations are more negative, such as with
arrogance, rather than positive (Thalmayer, Saucier, et al., 2020). This leads to doubts about
eXtraversion being transferable across diverse cultural contexts in the sense of an existential universal
(Fontaine, 2011). It is also possible that the adjectives that describe eXtraversion in Western contexts do
not correspond to a single coherent trait in other contexts, which would render it non-universal. The
trait concept of eXtraversion might be specific to Western contexts, likely those where emotional
expression, positive emotions, and self-enhancement are highly valued (Kitayama et al., 2023).
Future Directions, Implications, Limitations
Our study extends the existing literature on personality trait measurement and outcomes by
assessing these questions in highly underrepresented contexts that differ in many socio-cultural
respects from the Western countries that dominate psychological research (Henrich et al., 2010;
Thalmayer, Toscanelli, et al., 2021). Our findings offer both practical and theoretical implications for
cross-cultural personality psychology and open several important pathways for future research. In the
following sections, we synthesize these contributions and next steps, with acknowledgement of our
study’s limitations.
The brevity and simplicity of the 27-item inventory that we developed here will be
advantageous for repeated ecological assessments and scenarios, involving extensive item batteries, as
in large panel and cross-national studies generally (Romano et al., 2023) and in the ALLS specifically.
Employing our marker scales in such designs could, for instance, provide valuable insights with respect
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 43
to cross-cultural differences in day-to-day personality dynamics. One important usage of these marker
scales is in further studies in the ALLS samples, for example to explore the long-term stability of traits
and to test if established normative personality trajectories, like personality maturation are consistent
across contexts, as well as how traits measured at age 18 predict outcomes later in adulthood. While our
results demonstrate that some HEXACO traits predict meaningful outcomes at a single time point, future
studies can consider a wider range of outcome variables to better understand which aspects of the
HEXACO’s nomological net might be more universal and which more context-specific (Zettler et al.,
2020). This entails examining how these traits predict impactful life outcomes such as career success,
community involvement, and political attitudes over the long term (Ozer & Benet-Martínez, 2006).
Ultimately, such research could contribute to a more global understanding of the predictive power of
personality traits. It is also important to test if the HEXACO-outcome associations found in our study
generalize to other majority-world populations, for example, if and where our finding that Emotionality
was not related to mental health replicates in other contexts. However, when applying our marker
scales, one should bear in mind that measuring personality traits with a consistent short phrase and
single adjectives offers a specific perspective on personality closely related to self-concept, as opposed
to items that describe specific behaviors or actions (Back et al., 2009; Romano et al., 2023; Wiedenroth
& Leising, 2020).
Uncovering the specific sociocultural factors that explain contextual variations in the expression
and consequences of personality traits is another important goal for further research. Our sample was
highly diverse, including members of nearly 50 different ethno-linguistic groups. This diversity in terms
of ethnicity, languages, geography, and sociodemographic living conditions is extremely valuable, but it
also highlights the challenges of using ‘country’ as a proxy for cultural context. Other cultural groupings,
membership in different kinds of churches, and differences in socio-economic status, cut across the
three countries. This was not addressed in the current study, and we hope that other teams, especially
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 44
African scholars, may develop ideas how to define the most meaningful group contrasts in these
samples.
In addition to theoretical questions arising from our research, there are important practical
implications that need to be considered when exporting personality models and inventories to other
places: Ignoring the contextual embeddedness of personality can lead to biased assessments, erroneous
conclusions, and ultimately, problematic outcomes, for example, when personality tests are used for
employee selection (Anglim et al., 2018). Another practical field is psychological treatment: In Europe
and North-America, psychotherapy sometimes aims to change personality aspects that are considered
dysfunctional, for example high emotional reactivity (Sauer-Zavala et al., 2017). Since personality traits
appear to associate differentially to mental health in these contexts, for example, with Emotionality
seen as much as a strength as a vulnerability. Thus, treatments targeting Emotionality can be harmful if
exported without careful consideration (Fanon, 1968; Horn, 2020; Lambo, 2010; Tamir et al., 2023).
Better comprehending the relationship between personality traits and mental health will be crucial for
crafting effective prevention strategies tailored to local contexts.
A major limitation of our marker scales is their limited content validity. Based on Olaru’s (2019)
advice for item-selection algorithms, we focused on the optimization criteria most essential for our
research questions, that is, we prioritized model fit, measurement invariance and reliability. Schroeders
and colleagues (2016) point out that optimizing model fit and internal consistency leads to scales with
similar, highly-correlated items, which might come at the cost of content validity. We overcame
problems associated with redundant items by ensuring that items were not highly intercorrelated
before applying the item-selection algorithm. But it would also be fair to say that the item pool used to
create our marker scales did not provide a fully comprehensive representation of the theoretical
HEXACO construct space (Haynes et al., 1995). Therefore, our short marker scales might not provide
complete construct coverage. To better understand which aspects of the HEXACO construct space are
HEXACO IN KENYA, NAMIBIA AND SOUTH AFRICA 45
covered by our scales and which are not, we assess here how our items correspond to the facets of the
HEXACO-100 (Lee & Ashton, 2018), results are reported in Supplement B.
In the light of our research goals and the brevity of our marker scales, we consider the lack of
construct coverage a reasonable trade-off. In addition, the observed correlations in line with HEXACO
theory indicate that our marker scales are valid (Cronbach & Mehehl, 1955; Funder & Gardiner, 2024;
Revelle & Garner, 2020). Nevertheless, further research could examine retest reliability along with
convergent and discriminant validity. In addition, a fruitful avenue for further research would be to
optimize the scales based on other criteria (e.g., construct coverage, balance between positively and
negatively keyed items, prediction of outcomes, construct coverage; see Jankowsky et al., 2020; Olaru,
2019; Steger, 2023). In the interest of possible augmentation of our marker scales for improved
construct coverage in future usage, we identified further items of potential utility, including the most
frequent item combinations that consistently appeared across the 50 item selection runs (see
wish to extend our marker scales.
Other extensions might be bottom-up: The ALLS includes over 100 single-adjective-personality-
items administered using the same response format, chosen to assess the Cross-Cultural Big Two
(Thalmayer et al., in press) and the Khoekhoe Personality Inventory (Thalmayer, Saucier, et al., 2021) as
well as the HEXACO. These items could be pooled to empirically identify locally-relevant scales that best
associate with or predict key outcomes over time.
