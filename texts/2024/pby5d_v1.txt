ABSTRACT
There is a divide in English Language (EL) education in South Korea where the rich can afford
additional English educational resources for their children compared to the poor. Native
English Teachers (NETs) are hired to provide an authentic EL experience, with a focus on
enhancing communication in public schools. The need for NETs is far greater at rural public
elementary schools, as the students have limited resources and exposure towards English.
Currently, there is a gap in English education in South Korea and a gap in the research about
the pedagogical well-being of NETs, although it provides crucial knowledge in understanding
the language teaching quality of NETs.
Emotion, identity and emotional labour have been identified as factors affecting teacher
well-being. These factors will be investigated to understand how it shapes and effects the
pedagogical well-being of NETs at rural public elementary schools. To understand the effect
of these components, seven NETs working at rural public elementary schools were recruited
through an advertisement placed on social media and through word-of mouth. Semi-
structured interviews were conducted telephonically with each NET, and the data was
thematically analysed using the NVivo software tool to uncover themes.
The themes uncovered that when the self-perceived identity of NETs are challenged,
emotions of frustration and annoyance negatively affect NET interactions with students and
work colleagues. When NETs suppress emotions of frustration and alienation through
masking their emotions, it has the potential to trigger stress and burnout; negatively
affecting interactions with students, colleagues, and the development of instructional tools.

CHAPTER 1
Introduction
The ubiquitous English Language (EL) frenzy has been compared to the fable of Aladdin's
lamp, where it opens opportunities to business, technology, and travel (Hillman et al., 2023).
The EL frenzy has taken over South Korea as there has been a shift in teaching strategies
from the grammar-translation method to a focus on the communicative approach, which
has been enforced in South Korean educational policies by placing ‘Native English Teachers’
(NETs) from Anglophone countries in English classrooms; with the ostensible goal of
providing students with an authentic EL learning experience (Cinnamon, 2021). NETs from
one of the seven Anglophone countries (namely the U.K, Australia, South Africa, Ireland
New Zealand, the U.S and Canada) are eligible to apply for an E-2 teaching visa to teach
English in South Korea (Howard, 2019) and they are not required to have prior teaching
experience, although a bachelor’s degree is required (Choi, 2022).
The EL boom in South Korea has led to Korean parents investing heavily in EL learning, by
means such as sending their children abroad to Anglophone countries and spending
exorbitant amounts on EL education (Park, 2009). However, it leaves a disparity in EL
education between those who can afford it and those who cannot afford it (Shin & Lee,
2019). The dichotomy between the rich and poor in EL education is labelled with the
ubiquitous term English Divide in South Korea, which signifies this disparity (Crookes, 2017).
This divide has been met with frustration and anger from Korean residents towards the
Korean government, as it is leaves rural students unequivocally unable to compete
with urban students that benefit from EL resources such as private English academies (Bae
& Choi, 2023). A report by The Korea Times states that elementary school children in the
affluent area of Gangnam have private English lessons prior to the third grade, compared to
students living on the outskirts of Gangnam (“English Divide,” 2024). According to the
Korean national curriculum, students begin English classes from Grade 3 (alphabet learning
only begins in Grade 4) in elementary school with a focus on communication; to avoid
grammar and reading based English teaching methods that are already established in
middle and high schools (Jung & Norton, 2002). It is evident that NETs placed in public rural
elementary schools in South Korea have enormous pressure placed on their shoulders, as
they are teaching students who lack the English learning resources compared to urban
students.
The government has implemented various techniques to overcome the shortcomings of the
learning gap caused by the English Divide such as introducing after-school programs in
public schools to replace private tutoring (Bae & Choi, 2023). They have also placed NETs in
schools as a political act to showcase their efforts in counteracting the English Divide (Shin
et al., 2021). Hence, it is evident that NETs play an integral role in enhancing communication
in public schools, as they create an immersive EL learning environment where students can
build authentic rapport with NETs (Yu & Lee, 2019). However, Cinnamon (2021) states that
there is limited research regarding NETs teaching in South Korea, thus the author had to
broaden her research to other parts of Asia that follow a similar strategy and goal in hiring
NETs as South Korea.
Lee and Jang (2023) agree that there is limited research on the professional development of
NETs and their beliefs and values towards teaching; as current NET research primarily
focuses on the experiences of NETs living abroad and their co-teaching relationship with
Korean teachers. The need for NET research is highlighted by Li (2021) who states that
research into the well-being of ESL teachers can produce important information about what
factors determine the language teaching quality of ESL teachers. Soini et al. (2010) add that
emotions influence the occupational well-being of teachers and their ability in completing
pedagogical tasks, for example if teachers feel overwhelmed in the classroom, they might
adopt a teacher-centred approach towards learning; affecting student learning. It is evident
that various spheres of research on teaching English in South Korea have largely neglected
or overlooked NETs although they play a significant role in EL learning, especially in rural
public elementary schools. Thus, it is imperative to zoom in on the well-being of NETs as it
provides crucial knowledge to understand the factors affecting their teaching quality.
Emotion is defined as a social construct (Lasky, 2005) that is rooted within ideological,
cultural, and historical factors (Zemblayas, 2007). In this study, emotion will not be analysed
in the context of polarised opposites but rather on how it is constructed in the social
environment (Gkonou et al., 2020). Mercer (2024) adds that emotion should be viewed as
interlinked to identity; as the author explains that one’s identity constructs emotion and
emotion exemplifies the importance of one’s identity. The identity of NETs in South Korean
classrooms is debatable, as they are hired as English teaching assistants with limited roles
and duties (Lee & Jang, 2023).
However, their role is dependent upon their Korean co-teacher who could reverse their
roles and decide to act as a teacher’s assistant instead (Cinnamon, 2021). The identity of the
NET changes from a teacher’s assistant to the assumed lead role of an English teacher,
although contesting views from Koreans can challenge the identity of NETs as they are
viewed as unqualified because they are primarily hired due to their English competence,
where neither prior teaching experience nor a teaching licensure is needed to secure an E2
visa (Hwang & Yim, 2019). Tensions exist as NETs construct emotions as either an English
teacher or a teacher’s assistant, although outside opinions and perspectives can trigger
emotion towards that identity. It is evident that emotion and identity tensions intertwine.
Emotional labour is defined as the tensions that exist between expected emotions in the
workplace and genuine emotions (Blake & Dewaele, 2022). Hochschild’s (1979) theory on
emotional labour states that there are emotional rules (feelings and expression rules) in
societies; where emotions are self-regulated pertaining to what is appropriate in a given
social setting. In terms of the teaching context, Hopkyns and Gkonou (2023) state that there
are certain areas of teaching where emotional labour is experienced more severely than
others (such as high stakes testing). Furthermore, the impact of emotional labour in the
teaching environment hinders opportunities for teacher pedagogical reform and introspect
(Song, 2016). Emotional labour is divided into two distinct categories: surface acting and
deep acting, where surface acting is defined as masking emotions without genuinely
changing how one feels, and deep acting is defined as the cognitive process of internally
aligning emotions within organizational standards to produce a more authentic display of
emotions (Hochschild, 1979).
NETs face numerous challenges in the ESL classroom such as students who lack English
language skills, a mix of various student levels and the use of the L1 (first language) in the
English classroom (Moodie & Nam, 2015). As the Korean co-teacher is present in the
classroom, translanguaging can be used as a tool to overcome language barriers as it is
defined as having the ability to move from one language to another, which can be useful in
pedagogical practices (Burton & Rajendram, 2019). However, ESL teachers can be
emotionally triggered in language classes when emotions such as frustration are suppressed;
due to the incomprehensibility of the L1 (Hopkyns & Dovchin, 2024). These emotions can be
managed through either deep or surface acting, however it can lead to repeated stress
causing psychological pressure and physical illness leading to burnout (Näring et al., 2006). It
is evident that there is a need to investigate the emotional labour of NETs, as the
consequences could be detrimental to achieving EL success.
Feelings of belonging, meaningfulness and a sense of coherence from teachers are of
upmost importance to avoid feelings of alienation and inequality, which hinders the
construction of pedagogical well-being (Soini et al., 2010). Hopkyns and Gkonou (2023) state
that the word belonging is synonymous to vocabulary such as identity, home, and
citizenship, where it should be understood as a dynamic process where connections can be
made across geographical location. Emotion is a social construct as previously mentioned,
thus NETs who seek feelings of belonging in South Korea must overcome the boundaries of
Korean culture; wherein emotion is embedded. NETs and Korean co-teachers are ubiquitous
for their contentious relationship (Cinnamon, 2021) and one of the reasons for this
fragmented relationship could be the Korean described feeling of Junuk.
Junuk is defined as having fear or anxiety when it comes to speaking English, which is typical
amongst Koreans (Kang, 2024). Furthermore, Junuk is a result of the Korean belief that a
native English accent is needed to speak English, otherwise there is a reluctance to speak
English to native speakers from Koreans (Park, 2012). Therefore, resistance from Korean co-
teachers to speak English to NETs can impact the feeling of belonging and lead to alienation;
affecting their pedagogical well-being.
The Teacher Pedagogical Well-Being Rubric by Soini et al. (2010) is a useful tool that
introduces four interlinking components to assess teacher pedagogical well-being, namely: 1)
interactions with students 1) interactions with colleagues 3) making evaluations 4) choosing
and developing instructional tools. This study will investigate the emotions of NETs in their
schools and their impact on these four aforementioned components; to assess teacher
pedagogical well-being at rural public elementary schools. Emotion has been identified as a
factor that influences well-being (Hascher & Waber, 2021) and furthermore identity and
emotional labour have been linked to emotion. Thus, the research questions of this study
are formulated below.
1.1) Research Questions
To comprehend and understand the intricacies of the emotions of NETs and their influence
on English classrooms in South Korea (with a focus on rural public elementary schools), the
researcher will aim to investigate the following research questions (from the standpoint of
what emotions do in the context of rural public elementary schools):
1. How does emotion and identity tensions intertwine to influence the pedagogical
well-being of NETs within rural public elementary schools in South Korea?
2. How does emotional labour influence the pedagogical well-being of NETs within
rural public elementary schools in South Korea?
The relevant literature of this study will be further discussed in depth in Chapter 2. The
introduction has set the context and research gap of the study; formulating the research
topic: ‘Pedagogical well-being of NETs (Native English Teachers) teaching ESL (English as a
Second Language) at rural public elementary schools in South Korea’.
CHAPTER 2
Literature Review
This chapter will provide a detailed overview of the relevant literature in relation to the
research topic: ‘Pedagogical well-being of NETs (Native English Teachers) teaching ESL
(English as a Second Language) at rural public elementary schools in South Korea’.
The relevant literature of this research study is organised into the following sections:
1) Emotion and Pedagogical Well-Being
2) Native English Teachers (NETs) in South Korea and emotion
3) The Complexity of the NETs Professional Identity and Emotion
4) Translanguaging and Emotion
5) Junuk as a Sticky Object
6) Emotion and Emotional Labour.
7) Research Gap
2.1) Emotion and Pedagogical Well-Being
In the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA), research on emotion has to some degree
been largely neglected even though it is: salient in encouraging action from learners and
teachers, evident in language learning, and in language classrooms (Dewaele, 2015). By
taking a post-structuralist approach in understanding the complexities of emotion, it can be
a catalyst for pedagogical and institutional change (Her & De Costa, 2022). A post-
structuralist approach towards emotion is defined as not viewing emotion as a single
biological unit that is an innate response to an event, but rather viewing it as a response
impacted by the social environment (Zembylas, 2005). It must be noted that feelings are
cognitive and influenced by emotion, compared to emotion which is a reaction to the social
environment (Damasio, 2004) In the context of education, emotions are abundant and
inherent within the teaching sphere thus it is essential to consider why and how teachers
use their emotions in their classrooms (Chen & Tang, 2024), as the teaching profession is
associated with high levels of stress and work burnout; leading to job dissatisfaction (Carroll
et al., 2021)
As previously mentioned in Chapter 1, there is a need for research about the well-being of
ESL teachers as it produces knowledge about what factors determine the language teaching
quality of ESL teachers (Li, 2021). Teacher well-being is an important aspect to assess at
schools, as it concerns teacher satisfaction by highlighting engagement from teachers. (Li,
2021). Although, taking an arbitrary stance towards teacher well-being by viewing it solely
as a tool to avoid burnout and to produce student benefits results in overlooking its’ true
purpose; making teacher well-being a priority in schools (Siriwardana, 2022). Soini et al.
(2010) take the concept of teacher well-being further, by introducing teacher pedagogical
well-being as a social process that is impacted by multilevel compartments of the learning
environment (such as interactions with work colleagues and students).
Carroll et al. (2021) highlight the impact of the multilevel school environment on teachers
by stating that teacher stress is generated from a wide range of factors from multiple school
compartments such as: school culture, government policies, and students to name a few,
which affect teacher well-being. Furthermore, Murphy et al. (2020) discuss the current
climate on teacher well-being where there are numerous studies that discuss the benefits of
it towards effective classroom practice, although the work of Soini et al. (2010) is
highlighted by the author for its’ focus on the core components that influence teaching,
which can serve as a tool to transform teaching and learning environments. It is evident that
in the context of NETs, it is important to understand how and why emotions (responses
within their work environment) of NETs affect their pedagogical practices.
2.2) Native English Teachers (NETs) in South Korea and Emotion
The English Language (EL) phenomenon has captivated English education policies around
the world due to the rise of globalisation, in the context of South Korea it has been enforced
and promoted in modern society as being one of the most important skills to have to
succeed in the modern world (Song, 2018). The implementation of NETs in public schools
exacerbates the aim of English education in South Korea (Moodie & Nam, 2015).The power
of EL learning in South Korea is undeniable, where NETs are considered to be sophisticated
speakers of English from an Anglophone countries (Lee & Jang, 2023). Thus, one might
assume that NETs are viewed favorably or desirably in their school environments, although
in reality Choe and Lee (2021) state that NETs have expressed a loss of identity, feelings of
annoyance, frustration and isolation in their ESL classroom. In addition, there is a high
turnover rate amongst NETs (yearly contracts being one of the reasons) exacerbating their
lack of long-term commitment towards English Language Teaching (ELT) (Zein & Butler,
2022).
As previously mentioned, emotion is correlated with an individual's sense of identity
(Zembylas, 2005). When teachers are from various cultural and language backgrounds, the
situation becomes complex as their emotional experience intertwines with a shifting
cultural lens (Benesch, 2019). In the context of this research, the existing emotional
experience of NETs from abroad are placed within the Korean cultural lens. Furthermore,
Barrett (2017) adds that power, ideology and culture create an emotional discourse that
teachers can either participate in or resist. Hence, research that delves into understanding
teacher emotions produces a fountain of knowledge surrounding their professional context,
which is conducive towards understanding classroom strategies and learning outcomes
(Kong, 2019).
As previously mentioned, emotion cannot be understood and separated into two binary
categories of positive and negative emotions, as emotion is dynamic and complex over time
and across settings (Gkonou et al., 2020). Lantolf and Swain (2019) describe emotional
conceptualization as being underpinned by the social and political climate of a period of
time, for example, during federal times love was defined as being risky and secretive, in the
19th century love was based on romantic qualities of personal attraction, and in the 20th
century paternal love was used as a marketing tactic by clothing companies to persuade
parents to buy expensive clothing for their children. However, the focus should not be on
the evolution of emotion but rather on the understanding of emotion, as Benesch (2019)
highlights that the understanding of what emotion does in the social context plays a much
more significant role in comprehending emotion rather than solely defining it. It is evident
that NETs’ emotions can provide rich information into understanding their magnitude and
effect in the workplace.
2.3) The Complexity of the NET’s Professional Identity and Emotion
NETs in South Korea are not perceived as independent teachers who have sole control of
their classrooms by co-teachers and students, as their job description is that of a teacher
assistant with limited roles and duties (Lee & Jang, 2023). Howard (2019) adds that NETs
have struggled with their professional identity as they are registered as instructors on their
visas and not teachers, exacerbating the complexity of their professional identity. There
seems to be tensions between the educational goals of creating an authentic English
learning environment, and the hiring of native speakers who are only required to have a
bachelor’s degree in any field as NETs with the job description of assistants, even though
they fulfil the role of language teachers (Lee & Jang, 2023).
Interactions with students are crucial in language education due to the social nature of
language teaching between teachers and students (Derakhshan et al., 2022), thus the NETs
role being reduced to an assistant teacher leaves little room for achieving the EL goal of
authentic communication. Vygotsky made the profound statement that learning takes place
through socialization (Smagorinsky, 2023). However, Zambrana-Ortiz (2011) describes the
experience of a teacher who identified as a performer in their language classroom; a source
of entertainment for the students, which created an unpleasant feeling rooted in emotion
and cognitive dissonance about their professional identity. Hence, an understanding of
teacher cognition is crucial for gaining insight into the dynamics of a classroom, as it opens
the window to the pedagogical choices and perspective of the teacher (Li, 2017).
Lee and Jang (2023) state that there is limited research in understanding the complexities of
language teacher identity, as the self-perception of language teachers influences their
pedagogy and student English learning. In addition, teacher emotions and identities are
regulated by institutions that promote feelings rules (socially shared norms influencing how
one should feel in a social setting) that guide the professional performance of teachers
(Nazari & Karimpour, 2023). NETs have felt a detachment and isolation from their Korean
faculty and management, due to the ubiquitously and loosely used term waygook
(foreigner); which has created a divide from Korean co-workers (Howard, 2019). Wolff and
De Costa (2017) add that changes in teacher identity will lead to modifications in teaching
strategies, especially when adjusting to a new teaching context. As previously mentioned,
NETs are not perceived as a traditional teacher and have been marked with the term
foreigner in Korean society, leading to the question: Can NETs be fully integrated and
accepted in Korean society as an EL teacher?
Korean society is a racially homogenous and monolingual society, where students rarely
have the chance to speak English or meet a foreigner outside of the classroom (Park &
Oxford, 1998). The social background of Korean students can be influenced by the
stereotypical perception of foreigners, forming the categorisation of emotions. Schumann
(2019) discusses the complexities of categorising emotional labels (fear can be experienced
as worry, concern and panic) and how these labels are learned from a young age through
their native language based on culture and societal norms. Furthermore, Benesch (2019)
adds that emotions are mediated by higher powers. These unpleasant emotions inflicted
upon or experienced by NETs can threaten their professional longevity (Herrera et al., 2022).
To overcome these challenges, Derakhshan et al. (2022) state that a neutral emotional
response from NETs can be transferred to the classroom, which fosters a demotivated
classroom environment.
2.4) Translanguaging and Emotion
A power struggle can exist between the NET and the Korean co-teacher in solidifying their
identity in the English classroom, as students perceive the English of the NET to be the
correct and the standard form of English compared to the qualified Korean co-teacher
(Hwang & Yim, 2019). Tensions in unifying the Korean co-teacher and the NET in the English
classroom has been an ongoing challenge where professional development is needed (Zein
& Butler, 2022). Translanguaging is a useful tool to overcome these power tensions, as it is
defined as the ability to transition from the L1 to the L2 language; consolidating the various
dimensions of teachers’ and students’ emotions, attitudes, and identities within a social
context (Nazari & Karimpour, 2023). However, translanguaging has been met with criticism
as some scholars believe that translanguaging may be an indication of linguistic
inadequacies or a lack of dedication to the EL (Li & Peng, 2023). It is stated that
translanguaging should be understood from the perspective that features from an
individual’s entire linguistic and semiotic repertoire is deployed depending on the context
(Brooks, 2021). The successful execution of both the L1 and L2 can occur once the speaker
realises that their L1 can be a useful tool in creating meaningful communication (Ahn et al.,
2020).
The South Korean English curriculum emphasises the acquisition of English through the
actual use of it; without relying on rote memory by focusing on communication and fluency
(Shin, 2007). However, with the L1 in use in the classroom and the lack of confidence shown
by Korean co-teachers in communicating in English (Shin, 2020), have language policies and
translanguaging been effectively executed in South Korea? Currently, there is little
empirical research on ESL (English as a Second Language) teacher emotions and
translanguaging (Hopkyns & Dovchin, 2024). Furthermore, the NET is placed in the EL
classroom to assist in enhancing communication capabilities of students and to also
enlighten students in the cultural, symbolic and contextual meaning of language (Yu &
Heechul, 2019). According to Ra (2021) language is a social practice that is not confined to a
fixed system, but rather where language users produce and negotiate different forms of
language to convey meaning and intent. It is evident that translanguaging takes place in
South Korean classrooms, but the effect on NETs is unknown.
It is suggested that language policies may intersect with teacher emotions, navigating
emotional rules on how teachers should feel in the workplace (Her & De Costa, 2022).
In the research article, “Translanguaging and emotionality of English as a second language
(ESL) teachers” by Hopkyns and Dovchin (2024) an American NET working as an ESL teacher
in the UAE expressed complex emotions and powerlessness in the ESL classroom in regards
to translanguaging, where the teacher expressed frustration and inadequacy due to the
inability of neither understanding nor having the capability of conveying the L1 to his
students.
To overcome these challenges, Gkonou et al. (2020) suggests that sufficient support be
implemented, combined with voluntary participation; encouraging teacher engagement and
a feeling of inclusivity or purpose within the educational institution.
2.5) ‘Junuk’ as a Sticky Object
Understanding the emotions of Korean co-teachers in the English classroom is important
due to the close working relationship between them and the NET. Language anxiety is
defined as an unpleasant emotional reaction that may arise when using a foreign or second
language; a form of communicative anxiety that can occur in the foreign language classroom
(Sevinç & Backus, 2017). The debate surrounding English proficiency between native and
non-native English teachers is not peculiar within the realm of English instruction, where
non-native teachers struggle with stereotypical viewpoints from outsiders that they lack
intelligible speech and nativelike pronunciation, which feeds into the vicious cycle that they
are inferior to native English speakers (Wolff & De Costa, 2017). Even with a reasonable
competence in English, some Korean English teachers have reported having anxiety and
bodily reactions (palpitations, sweating, nausea etc.) when having to speak English in front
of the NET (Song & Park, 2019).
This debilitating anxiety is referred to as junuk; a Korean word commonly used by Koreans
to describe feelings of inadequacies and inferiority, which is especially used in the context of
speaking English (Park, 2012). Ahmed (2004) discusses the idea that objects (the social)
become sticky with affect through repetition, carrying a familiar emotional reaction thus
making it difficult for objects to acquire a new meaning or value. In this context, one can
deduce that the word junuk carries an emotional connection for the Korean speaker,
whereby speaking to a NET becomes sticky with junuk carrying feelings of anxiety and social
norms for the Korean speaker.
As previously mentioned, the role of the co-teacher is to assist the NET in the classroom and
to help them settle into South Korea, with this preconceived notion and sticky matter it
could create tensions between the NET and the co-teacher; influencing the pedagogical
well-being of the NET. Soini et al. (2010) discuss the complex and sometimes contradictory
nature of the school environment, wherein there are instances of avoidance, opposition and
resistance from different members of the school environment resulting in underlying
tensions in the school context. To overcome the complexities of junuk as a sticky object,
Benesch (2019) suggests that these objects (in this case the NET) be dissected to allow for
analysis and assessment, to enable a radical change in emotion (in this case from the Korean
English teacher).
2.6) Emotional Rules and Emotional Labour
To uncover the management of genuine emotions by NETs in the context of their school
environment, emotional labour will be reviewed. Jalilzadeh et al. (2024) state that the
impact of emotional labour depends on the following personal factors of teachers such as:
well-being, motivation, emotional intelligence and personality traits. Emotional intelligence
is defined as an individual's ability to recognise their emotions, which plays a crucial role in
emotional labour (Wen et al., 2019) Furthermore, the negative effects of emotional labour
have less to do with losing oneself, but more to do with having to construct multiple
identities in different contexts that is exacerbated by disciplinary forces and emotional rules
(Zembylas, 2005). Nazari and Karimpour (2022) discuss the complex oscillating identities of
teachers in the classroom, where teachers resist institutional forces shaping their identity to
support and care for the needs of their students, however when classes are observed by
superiors there is a shift in their identify and genuine emotions are suppressed. The
suppression of genuine emotions (emotional labour) lacks the opportunity to critical
evaluate emotions in teaching, allowing for pedagogical reform (Song, 2016).
There are numerous reasons for NETs carrying the burden of emotional labour such as:
insufficient autonomy by NETs in the selection of teaching methods; causing self-doubt that
affects their professional development, a lack of proper training for novice teachers who are
assigned tasks beyond their current capabilities, the hierarchical system in Korea where
elders are prioritized, and administrative tasks that rob teachers of their time to effectively
lesson plan (Kim & Kim, 2018).
To overcome emotional labour, resilience is defined as the ability to rebound from
unfavourable emotional experiences (Tugade et al., 2004) and is highlighted by Murphy et al.
(2020) as a solution to overcome challenging teaching situations, although resilience is a
form of deep acting (Lee & Kim, 2020). Kim and Kim (2018) explain that when NETs changed
their emotions to assist students in the English classroom, it comes at the expense of
physical and mental exhaustion. It is added, as previously mentioned that the management
of emotions through surface and deep acting can lead to burnout (Näring et al., 2006).
There are cases where EFL (English as a Foreign Language) teachers choose the teacher-
centred approach to learning over the communicative approach, especially in cases when
students are misbehaving or not participating in lessons; leading teachers to adapt their
lesson plans to decrease the burden of emotional labour (Kim & Kim, 2018). Soini et al.
(2010) add that a teacher-centred approach is likely to be chosen when teachers are lacking
the support from members of the school community and empowerment in their profession.
In the context of South Korean English classrooms, this could lead to tensions between the
South Korean EL policy of achieving student communication and the learning approach of
the NET, which is dependent upon their well-being.
In teacher-centred classrooms control over students is of utmost importance and passive
students are valued above active students (Garrett, 2008). However, Eisenring and Margana
(2019) argue that to learn a new language the communicative approach should be instilled
in the language classroom, as language and communication are interdependent and
learning a new language means communicating in that language. Thus, it is imperative to
consider the emotions of teachers as it not only influences their pedagogical well-being, but
also the teaching quality and learning of students which indicates that the relationship
between teachers’ emotions and pedagogy have a direct impact on student teaching (Lee et
al., 2017).
2.7) Research Gap
Various literature on the field of emotion and its’ influence on the pedagogical well-being of
NETs in South Korea has been investigated. The literature has identified factors such as
emotion, professional identity, emotional labour, junuk and translanguaging that affect the
pedagogical well-being of NETs, although there is room to investigate and understand more
underlying themes in emotion, identity and emotional labour. Hopkyns and Dovchin (2024)
state that there is a scarcity in the research on ESL teacher emotions in translanguaging, and
Lee and Jang (2023) add that there is limited research in understanding the complexities of
language teacher identity. Gaining insight into the dynamics of a classroom is crucial for
opening the window into the pedagogical choices and perspectives of the teacher (Li, 2007).
This research will allow for scope and critical understanding on the cognitive and emotional
challenges that NETs are faced with in rural public elementary schools in South Korea, and
consequently their influence on their pedagogical well-being.
CHAPTER 3
Methodology
This chapter will outline and discuss the methodological choices of the researcher. It is
stated that asking the why, what, from where, when and how data will be collected and
analysed is an important aspect of the methodological process (Scotland, 2012). The
research questions that were developed in Chapter 2 are reflected upon consistently
throughout the methodological process. The researcher acknowledges that the methods
section should be fully transparent, to determine whether there has been any influence in
the data collection and analysis (LeCompte, 2000).
3.1) Research Paradigm
The research paradigm is a salient component in the belief system of research as it
describes the nature of reality, as well as how one attains knowledge from this reality (Sahri
et al., 2022). In addition, it is of upmost importance to understand and determine the
research paradigm of the research as it shapes the methods that will be used in the research
(Ulz, 2024). Furthermore, the research paradigm is a theoretical framework that consists of
four elements namely: ontology, epistemology, methodology and methods (Sahri et al.,
2022). The ontology and epistemology of the research will be discussed below; however, it
must be noted that unpacking the researcher's ontology and epistemology is no easy task
(Nguyen & Chia, 2023).
3.2) Ontology
Ontology is defined as, “What reality is and what it is constituted by” (Uzun, 2016, p. 836).
Ontology consists of the dichotomy: realism and relativism; by defining these two terms the
researcher can make the first step in analysing their ontological views (Moon & Blackman,
2014). Realism is objective and defined as facing the true form of reality; without trying to
reduce it to a familiar form thus separating it from the human experience (Wild, 1947). In
comparison, relativism is subjective and defined as having multiple realities thus it cannot
be separated from the human experience (Shapin, 2012). The research topic on the,
‘Pedagogical well-being of NETs (Native English Teachers) teaching ESL (English as a Second
Language) at rural public elementary schools in South Korea’ was inspired by the
researcher’s own experience of working as a NET at a rural public elementary school in
South Korea and interacting with other NETs outside of the workplace. When educator
researchers have lived abroad for several years, they encounter epistemological and
ontological borders daily; wherein they grapple with the Otherness (Nguyen & Chia, 2023)
which is defined as realising differences or diversity within a context, even though there is
the perception of sameness (Doubková et al., 2024).
Conversations with other NETs (the inherent discussions of feelings and emotions in the
workplace) spurred introspection from the researcher and the need to further understand
NETs in their work environment; inspiring the research question. Thus, it is inevitable that
the researcher’s ontological view is relative, where reality is subjective to an individual
person.
3.3) Epistemology
Epistemology is defined as, “what knowledge is, how knowledge is created, comprehended
and disseminated.” (Uzun, 2016, p. 836). Ontology serves as a bridge between
epistemology and methodology (Grass, 2024) as epistemology is concerned with the
intricacies of knowledge and how it will be extracted from a reality of research (in this case
there are multiple realities) and what can the researcher contribute towards that
knowledge (Saunders et al., 1996). Knowledge is separated into three categories, namely:
objectivism, constructionism, and subjectivism (Moon & Blackman, 2014)
When knowledge is objective, it is observable and facts can be replicated based on scientific
methods, whereas subjective knowledge is drawn from individual perceptions without any
direct influence from the object (Diesing, 1966). In the context of this research, knowledge
can neither be objective nor subjective as the various opinions, pedagogies, and emotions of
NETs are brought into the South Korean social context where two worlds collide and social
norms are challenged. Hence, constructionism is a relevant choice for this research, as
meaning is socially constructed (Moon & Blackman, 2014). Constructionism rejects the idea
that there is an objective truth but embraces the idea that meaning differs; even if it is
constructed out of the same phenomenon such as cultures (Feast & Melles, 2010). The
epistemological study of a social practice can be used to derive how meanings of a social
nature are constructed (Fraser et al., 2012). As the study of this research is of a social
nature as evident in Chapter 2 and the research questions, it is undeniable that the
epistemological approach will be constructionism.
3.4) Social Constructivism Paradigm
The ontological and epistemological stance of the researcher has been outlined, where the
researcher takes on a relative ontological approach and a constructionist epistemological
approach. This section will place these views in the appropriate research paradigm, where
these philosophical views guide the researcher in their thinking and behaviour towards the
research (Mertens, 1997). Thus, the social constructivism paradigm seems to be suitable for
this research for several reasons: firstly, it highlights the social nature of human
development and knowledge, secondly, it highlights ideas and identities to be imperative in
building peace amongst conflicting relationships, and thirdly, it filters through the layers of
society and discovers the causes of conflict (Carey, 2021). As mentioned in Chapter 2, there
often seems to be underlying tensions between NETs and their co-teachers regarding
translanguaging, classroom management and the placement of the sticky object junuk on
NETs, which is filled with affect rooted in ideology and culture. The researcher aims to
comprehend the emotional reactions and identity tensions of NETs, and how they construct
their subjective reality through interactions in their workplace.
The research fits into the social constructivism paradigm, however there are elements of the
interpretivism, and the transformative paradigm present in the research. Firstly,
interpretivism views knowledge as dependent on the human perception/experience of their
reality (Alharahsheh, & Pius, 2020). This research has an element of focusing on the
experience of an individual's reality, however it is intertwined with the social construction of
knowledge. Secondly, in Chapter 2, the limited research into ESL emotions were discussed
thus the researcher considers that elements of the transformative paradigm is present in
the research, as it voices the opinions and perspectives of the unheard (Mertens, 2007). The
researcher acknowledges her position within the social constructivism paradigm, however
she is not oblivious to the perceptible elements of the interpretive and transformative
paradigm within the research.
3.5) Research Approach
Research methodologies are classified into three categories, namely: quantitative,
qualitative and mixed methods (a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches)
(Coy, 2019). The research paradigm should be reflected upon throughout the research
regardless of the choice of methods (qualitative or quantitative) (Gale et al., 2013).
Qualitative research methods allows the researcher to gain in-depth understanding of a
phenomenon and uncover nuanced experiences that are not available through numerical
data (Darlaston-Jones, 2007), thus it is suitable for this research. Hence, in the social
constructivism paradigm, the researcher seeks to use qualitative methods to uncover and
explore answers to the research questions, as discussed below.
3.6) Research Methods
3.6.1) Sampling Strategy and Participant Recruitment
The participants for this research were recruited according to criterion sampling, which is
defined as determining and stating the characteristics needed from a population to be
eligible to partake in particular research (Schneider & Whitehead, 2013). The criteria for this
research were to be: 1) a NET currently employed at a rural public elementary school in
South Korea 2) sponsored under an E-2 visa.
It is advantageous for the researcher to be familiar with how to reach and locate the target
population (Negrin et al., 2022). The researcher works in the same field as NETs in South
Korea, hence she is aware about online ESL networks on Facebook, NET social groups and
NET groups on the mobile messaging application Kakao. To reach the target population, the
researcher created an ethically approved advertisement inviting eligible participants to
partake in the research (Appendix A), whilst assuring their confidentiality. The
advertisement was posted on various Facebook groups (that have a large following of
foreigners working in South Korea), NET Kakao groups, and through word-of-mouth.
Participants who were interested in partaking in the research were given an ethically
approved Participation Information Sheet (Appendix B) and partaking in the research was at
the discretion of the participant. Participants who agreed to partake in the researcher were
given an ethically approved Consent Form (Appendix C) which they were required to
complete. A convenient date and time was scheduled between the researcher and the
participant, once the consent form had been completed. The researcher recruited 7 NETs in
total. Schneider and Whitehead (2013) state that in qualitative research a formal criterion
for sampling size does not exist, as it is the richness of the data that is salient in answering
the research questions.
3.6.2) Research Instrument
The researcher chose to use semi-structured interviews (SSI) as the research
instrument because it allows for interviews to be focused but it also gives the
researcher the autonomy to probe pertinent ideas that appear during the interview;
which is useful for further exploration of a subject matter (Adeoye‐Olatunde &
Olenik, 2021). Before conducting the semi-structured interviews, the researcher
developed interview questions (Appendix D). DeJonckheere and Vaughn (2019) state
that SSI begin with surface-level questions relating to the context, before moving
onto more in-depth questions which are guided by the research questions.
The ‘Teacher Pedagogical Well-being’ rubric by Soini et al. (2010) was used as a
framework for formulating the SSI questions (Appendix D), whilst focusing on the
research themes of identity, emotion and emotional labour. McIntosh and Morse
(2015) state that to draft a SSI questionnaire, the researcher must: 1) identify the
topic of research 2) categories of the research 3) identify question stems. The four
categories were identified according to the pedagogical rubric (interactions with
students, making evaluations, choosing and developing instructional tools,
interactions with colleagues) and the question stems (identity, emotion and
emotional labour) were asked in relation to those categories. For example: What is
your relationship with your co-teacher like? The category is interactions with work
colleagues and the question stem is identity.
SSI were conducted and recorded simultaneously via the mobile phone of the researcher. It
was convenient to conduct the SSI via a mobile phone call, because the researcher wanted
to collect rich data from a variety of NETs teaching in different parts of South Korea. The
accessibility, ease, comfortability and ability to reach participants via a mobile phone
(Adeoye-Olatunde & Olenik, 2021) aided in conducting a seamless interview without any
distractions on either end.
The researcher deliberately used guided questions at the beginning of the interview to ease
participants into the SSI and to build rapport. The questions relating to identity were first
discussed, as the questions relating to emotions required deep thought, reflection and
processing from participants. The questions were open-ended to generate unstructured
responses and discussion between the researcher and participant (McIntosh & Morse, 2015).
The researcher noticed that participants started to gradually open up about their work
environment, as they became more comfortable with the structure of the SSI. The
researcher got a sense that participants were lifting a burden off their shoulders, as they
gave insight into their work environment.
The researcher allocated 60 minutes towards the SSI, and 10 minutes for any questions that
participants might have regarding the interview. However, the interviews took
approximately 24 minutes to 1 hour. There were some participants who gave in-depth
descriptions as responses and there were other participants who gave short responses,
which required the researcher to dig deeper by probing further with additional questions
within the confines of this research.
3.6.3) Data Analysis
Thematic analysis was chosen as an appropriate tool for the research analysis as it provides
a rich and deep understanding of the data (Braun & Clarke, 2019). Reflexive thematic
analysis (RTA) allows the researcher to make sense of the data and gain an in-depth
understanding of the data, by finding common patterns or themes embedded within the
data (Braun & Clarke, 2012). RTA differs from other branches of thematic analysis, in terms
of valuing the subjectivity and self-reflection of the researcher in the analysis process
(Campbell et al., 2021). It is a qualitative method where codes and themes are understood
and created by the researcher subjectively. The data collected from the SSI were analysed
according to the 6-step process of the RTA as recommended by Braun and Clarke (2021) and
published in the journal by Byrne (2021).
3.6.3.1) Phase One: Familiarisation with the Data
This phase highlights the intimate relationship between the researcher and the data,
whereby the researcher manually transcribes the data verbatim; including breaks, pauses,
tones etc... (Byrne, 2021). The researcher manually transcribed the audio-recordings
verbatim to a Word document (Appendix G) which included pauses, breaks, reflection and
stuttering. The researcher re-listened to the audio recordings of participants multiple times
to capture any non-verbal cues in sentences and words. It was a time-consuming process,
but it allowed the researcher to become intimate and familiar with the data.
3.6.3.2) Phase Two: Generating Initial Codes
The coding process is undertaken to produce labels of interpretation of the data (Byrne,
2021). The software tool NVivo was used in the analysis process, where the data was
imported and coded on the platform. The transcript of each participant was uploaded as a
Word document to the NVivo platform where the researcher re-read each transcription and
added comments or annotations. The researcher added the two research questions as title
codes on the NVivo platform, so that she could always reflect on the aims of the research.
The transcripts were read several times and coded to the relevant question, by collapsing
codes. The inductive approach was used in the coding process, because the researcher
wanted the codes to reflect the true nature of the collected data without any preconceived
themes or conceptual frameworks (Byrne, 2021).
3.6.3.3) Phase Three: Generating Themes
This phase focuses on the meaning of the dataset where codes are analysed and similar
codes are combined, aiding in theme creation (Byrne, 2021). Once the data was coded and
added to the research questions on the NVivo software, the researcher exported the data to
an Excel spreadsheet which reflected the sources and references of the generated codes. As
NVivo allows for data to be organized and synthesized efficiently (Mackey & Gass, 2021),
the researcher created a Word document that had the first and second research question as
looked at the codes with the highest number of references and sources and allocated each
code to a column.
To ensure that codes were coded efficiently from the Excel spreadsheet, the codes were
changed to the colour red once copied to the Word document. Codes that were similar or of
a similar nature were clustered together. Thus, the researcher could make sense and lift
meaning through identifying patterns in the dataset, when codes were clustered together.
Themes were generated by the researcher from the clustered codes, through reflection and
deep thought. Next, the research questions were collapsed on the NVivo software where
themes were added. Then, the codes were moved to the relevant theme. Braun and Clarke
(2016) state that the number of codes collected do not influence the research, but the
meaningfulness in the coding patterns is salient in producing answers the research
question.
3.6.3.4) Phase Four: Reviewing Potential Themes
This phase involves a two-step process. Firstly, the codes, sub-codes and themes should be
reviewed and secondly, the themes should be reviewed in terms of the whole dataset
(Byrne, 2021). The codes in each cluster were reviewed in terms of its connection to the
theme. The researcher moved some codes around and created some sub-codes after
reviewing them. After completing the first step, the researcher reviewed the themes and re-
read the transcripts (Appendix G) to make sure that that the themes were relevant to the
dataset.
3.6.3.5) Phase Five: Defining and Naming Themes
This phase focuses on ensuring that the themes are congruent with the research questions
and the dataset (Byrne, 2021). The themes should grab the reader's attention, whilst being
informative (Clarke & Braun, 2016). The reporting of the reflexive thematic framework will
be in the Results section of Chapter 4. The researcher will present their interpretation of the
dataset in the context of identified themes; which are supported by the views of
participants.
3.6.3.6) Phase Six: Producing the Report
This the final phase of the 6-step process of reflexive thematic analysis. The final phase is
the written report where the order of themes is established and any changes in the themes
are documented (Byrne, 2021). The written report, in this case would be this dissertation.
3.7) Ethics
As the research involves seven human participants and collects their subjective data, the
research is required to, and it has obtained ethical approval from the Ethics Committee of
the University of St Andrews according to their regulations (University of St Andrews, 2024).
The research was advertised on social networks and through word-of mouth.
The semi-structured interviews were recorded via the phone setting, and manually
transcribed onto a Word document on the University Network. The interviews were deleted
from the phone, once it had been transferred to the University OneDrive. The data was
encrypted, password controlled, and only shared with my supervisor. The data was stored in
a pseudonymised form, which meant that the names of participants were edited to protect
their identity. The original data and ‘key’ document were stored separately onto the hard
drive, where the original data and ‘key’ document linked participants’ unique name to their
real identity. Only the researcher could have access to the ‘key document’, to reconnect
participants’ data to them at a later date. The data was destroyed once the research of the
dissertation had been submitted.
The main ethical concerns for the researcher were to ensure to participants that the
research is voluntary, and informed consent is given assuring their confidentiality. The
Participation Information Sheet (Appendix B) provided a comprehensive outline of the
research in terms of the research topic, data collection methods, storage and ensuring
confidentiality. Participants were required to not name themselves, their school/schools or
any colleagues during the SSI.
If they were accidently mentioned, it was edited with a pseudonymised name by the
researcher. The Consent Form (Appendix C) ensures that the Participant Information Sheet
has been read; where participants understand the research process and consent can be
withdrawn at any time until 2 weeks after their interview date.
Validity and Reliability
To ensure the validity and reliability of the research, the researcher used respondent
validation to ensure that the data is credible. Respondent validation involves participants
checking and responding to the accuracy of their responses in the initial data collected
(Torrance, 2012). The researcher sent the pseudonymised transcript of the participant to
him/her via a mobile message; to check the accuracy of the transcript and to discuss
any transcription errors that might have been made by the researcher. Most participants
were surprised to see the amount of filler words used during the SSI, however the
researcher explained to them that the audio was manually transcribed verbatim because it
is part of the analysis process. Once participants understood the transcription process, they
checked the accuracy of their transcripts and any errors were communicated to the
researcher, which were immediately corrected. Once participants approved their
transcriptions, the researcher could move forward with valid and reliable data in the
analyses process.
CHAPTER 4
Results
As mentioned in Chapter 3, the fifth phase of the reflexive thematic analysis will be
discussed in this section; where themes will be named, defined and substantiated by data
collected from participants. The researcher will present her interpretations of the data in
the context of themes and sub-themes; guided by the research questions.
A broad overview of the Participants’ Information (Appendix F) assisted the researcher to
understand and be empathetic towards the perspectives of participants, whilst interpreting
the data to uncover themes and patterns. The Thematic Analysis Theme Map (Appendix E)
graphically presents the research questions as R1 (Research Question 1) and R2 (Research
Question 2) and gives an overview of the identified themes and subthemes of each research
question.
4.1) Research Question One: How does emotion and identity tensions intertwine to
influence the pedagogical well-being of NETs within rural public elementary schools in
South Korea?
4.1.1) Theme One: The Albatross of the Korean English Curriculum
The Korean English curriculum is compared to an albatross, as it hinders or restricts the
abilities and development of NETs in their professional capacity. The identified subthemes
of theme one are discussed below.
4.1.1.1) Misalignment of Teaching Goals Due to the Curriculum
NETs experienced annoyance and frustration regarding interactions with Korean co-teachers
in the classroom, where there is a misalignment of teaching goals between the NET and
their Korean co-teacher due to the curriculum. In Extract 1, Sammy stated that her Korean
co-teachers did not fully understand her role in the classroom nor the EL goals.
Extract 1:
“There's a frustration on them not understanding what we are trying to achieve, which, is,
uh, for the students to be able to actually communicate in the English Language and to be
able to understand the language, and to be able to write in the language.” (Sammy)
In Extract 2, Jay stated that the current teaching methods are not conducive towards the
goal of students achieving independent English communication and understanding. Sammy
and Jay are confined to their role, yet they are critical of the instructional tools in place to
teach English.
Extract 2:
“There’s always a lot of Korean as well. So that they can understand the English that they're
learning. So, it's like, it just, it doesn't stick because it's not repetitive enough, it's not how
can I say? Drilled enough and it's not applied enough [...]” (Jay)
4.1.1.2) Students Perceived Attitude towards the NET, Is the Curriculum to
Blame?
NETs struggled with the perception from colleagues and students that they are a game
teacher. In Extract 3, Sammy spoke about her frustration towards her Korean co-teachers
for emphasizing the game part of the lesson instead of the actual learning part of the
curriculum.
Extract 3:
“[...] students think maybe English is the game, is a game class instead of a learning class.
Because maybe, uhm, some teachers emphasize the game part as opposed to the learning
part of teaching.” (Sammy)
In Extract 4, James expressed his frustration and anger towards the persistent chants by
students to play English games, and he stated that he is perceived as a toy by students. The
perception of James and Sammy by students challenges their self-defined identity.
Extract 4:
“That, yeah, I would say is one thing that would constitute towards a bad day. It's like they
just see you sometimes as a toy. Let's play games […].” (James)
4.1.2) Theme Two: The Dual Role of the NET: A Korean English Teacher and a NET
It was uncovered that in most cases the NET takes over the role of their Korean co-teacher.
The identified subthemes of theme two are discussed below.
4.1.2.1) Overcoming Translanguaging Boundaries through Korean Translation
Methods
Having a basic knowledge of Korean and translation methods have helped NETs overcome
language barriers. In Extract 5, Luke explained that he writes Korean translations on the
board, but the English textbooks also have Korean instructions to complete the activities. He
avoids any dependency on his Korean co-teacher and is autonomous in his role.
Extract 5:
“I speak Korean, so I write the, the translations on the board in Korean for them. […] within
the government textbook, there is Korean instructions. ” (Luke)
In Extract 6, Tracey spoke about how language learning becomes an exchange between
herself and her students, where mistakes are a part of learning.
Extract 6:
“And if I can make mistakes in Korean, even if I write, sometimes I write translations on the
board in Korean, and I spell things wrong, they say, “Teacher, no!” and they stand up and
they take the pen off my hand and they correct me.” (Tracey)
4.1.2.2) an Opportunity for the NET to Implement Their Own Curriculum
Some NETs were given the opportunity to choose and develop their own instructional tools
in afternoon English classes, however there were conflicting NET sentiments towards this
opportunity. In Extract 7, Tracey showed enthusiasm and optimism towards having the
authority in choosing the instructional material, especially teaching students how to read,
which she thought was lacking in the curriculum.
Extract 7:
“So, I do that in afternoon class. I teach them, uh, lots of English rules. English has a lot of
rules, and the curriculum doesn't teach that. So, I teach Magic E.” (Tracey)
However in Extract 8, Jay stated that she thought the afternoon classes were pointless as
students perceived it as a fun period. She found it difficult to teach without her Korean co-
teacher’s assistance and to develop her own instructional tools. Jay stated that her role is a
teacher’s assistant, hence afternoon classes were outside the scope of her identity.
Extract 8:
“I feel like they're kind of futile, they're, they're pointless in a sense because I'm also on my
own and it's usually after-school class, it's you know, it's extra-curricular. So, kids or the
students as I've witnessed, they come to class with the idea that it's, it's fun time.” (Jay)
4.1.3) Theme Three: The NET is an Autonomous and Active Learner of the English
Classroom
Through the observations of their Korean co-teachers in the classroom, the NET becomes
and active learner in the classroom. The identified subthemes of theme three are discussed
below.
4.1.3.1) Autonomy and Leadership in the Classroom
Some NETs who have an autonomous role in the classroom, embraced their leadership role
positively. They incorporated their own instructional materials, which led to emotions of
motivation and self-worth. In Extract 9, Jo-Ann spoke about how creating student-centred
learning materials positively influenced her motivation in the classroom, where she felt
fulfilled within her role.
Extract 9:
“So, I incorporated a whole lot of different things, which I thought would get the kids, uhm,
more involved and more engaged in the classroom” (Jo-Ann)
In Extract 10, Ashlee prided herself in her militant routine for students, where she has full
control of her classroom.
Extract 10:
“So, I'd be like, “All right, books, pencils, eraser, file”. So, the students would know, okay,
they need their books, a pencil, they need to get a file and, or their notebook as
well.” (Ashlee)
4.1.3.2) Observations of Teaching Styles from Co-Teachers.
Some NETs stated that they learned how to teach from observing their Korean co-teachers
in the classroom. These observations inspired them to develop their own teaching style.
However, some NETs also criticised the teaching style choices of their co-teachers. In Extract
11, Jo-Ann acknowledged that her growth as a teacher is due to her observations of her
Korean co-teacher.
Extract 11:
“Get some ideas and learn from them how they do it. You might not do it in the same way,
but those ideas are helping the students learn.” (Jo-Ann)
However in Extract 12, Sammy stated that through her observations she noted that her
Korean co-teachers are reliant on the provided English materials to teach English to
students. Their dependence on the provided English materials, leaves little room for Sammy
to develop as an English teacher. The feelings of an unfulfilling classroom environment puts
pressure on Sammy’s professional identity.
Extract 12:
“What I've observed is that they use materials that is readily available which is the textbook,
the teacher's guide, and as well as the audio, uhm, to actually teach the lesson.” (Sammy)
4.1.4) Theme Four: The Complexity of Solidifying the NET’s Role
Solidifying the role of the NET has proven to be a complex task as evident in the data.
The identified subthemes of theme four are discussed below.
4.1.4.1) the Oscillating Role of the NET
NETs spoke about having to adapt to the teaching styles of multiple co-teachers and the
change in classroom climate when going from an autonomous role to a co-teaching role.
Emotions of overwhelmingness and anxiousness are experienced by NETs when their role
oscillates in various classrooms. In Extract 13, Luke spoke about the change in attitude from
students when he goes to their homeroom and their Korean teacher is present, compared
to when students go to his classroom for English without their homeroom teacher. Luke
described that the students were tense in their homerooms. It influences Luke's role as he
shares power with the Korean teacher, thus he does not have full control of the classroom,
which can be exhausting.
Extract 13:
“It's actually more work when I go to their room. When they come to my room, they're a lot
more relaxed. They're a lot more, uhm, they like to participate more. They ask questions, like
they won't ask questions if the Korean teachers there.” (Luke)
In Extract 14, Jay spoke about the strenuous task of teaching with multiple co-teachers and
having to adapt to each teacher’s teaching style. She added that the management of the
diversification of roles in the classroom could be better. It is evident that Jay’s identity
becomes lost amongst the layers of teaching adaptation.
Extract 14:
“So, I've kind of become used to that dynamic, like, I adapt to each teacher's style, so, I don't
think it's too weird, but it could be better.” (Jay)
4.1.4.2) Lack of Support from Work Colleagues
Some NETs explained that the lack of support from work colleagues in encouraging EL
learning made them feel annoyed, uneasy and unsupported in their role. They question
their role at their schools as they feel unsupported from Korean work colleagues. In Extract
15, Jay stated that she was given not any clear guidelines about her role or what was
required from her when she arrived at her school.
Extract 15:
“They don't actually tell you what they do, and it was very intimidating when I got here,
because I had no idea what I was doing or what I had to do.” (Jay)
In Extract 16, Luke stated that no words of encouragement is given to students for their use
of English outside of the classroom by Korean colleagues. He added that there is a huge
divide between Korean staff and their support of English.
Extract 16:
“I don't see a lot of the adults or the Korean staff giving praise like, “Oh your English skills
are really good”. “Oh like [...]” There’s a huge gap." (Luke)
4.2) Research Question Two: How does emotional labour influence the pedagogical well-
being of NETs within rural public elementary schools in South Korea?
4.2.1) Theme One: Choosing Isolation and Overcoming Alienation
In the data it was discovered that most NETs preferred isolation in their work environment,
although overcoming alienation proved to be more emotionally taxing. The identified
subthemes of theme one are discussed below.
4.2.1.1) Choosing Isolation
NETs deliberately chose isolation in their work environment, to avoid the emotional labour
of suppressing their emotions of anxiety, awkwardness and frustration. Their deliberate
choice of isolation limits their contact with work colleagues. In Extract 17, Jo-Ann stated that
she limits her contact with work colleagues due to workplace gossip.
Extract 17:
“[...] the thing I hate most about the workplace is gossip. Because I think it is very dangerous.
So, that is why I remove myself from any personal relationships [...]” (Jo-Ann)
In Extract 18, Jay chose isolation to avoid suppressing the anxiety of not understanding
Korean and the awkwardness of the office environment.
Extract 18:
“So, I would just avoid the office when they have a meeting or when they're having you know
conversations and laughing and stuff. I can barely understand.” (Jay)
4.2.1.2) Overcoming Alienation
Overcoming alienation has proven to be more emotionally taxing on NETs, as they describe
the invisible line between themselves and their Korean colleagues. Emotions of anger and
inadequacy are suppressed by NETs through inner dialogue, in order to fulfil their duties in
their schools. In Extract 19, Jo-Ann described the daily alienation she feels from Korean
work colleagues due to them identifying her by the term foreign teacher.
Extract 19:
“It is very insensitive- it happens every day. Somebody would just ask a question about me,
and they wouldn’t even use my name, they will just actually call me foreign teacher.” (Jo-
Ann)
In Extract 20, Luke used inner dialogue to explain to himself why Koreans might not like
foreigners and his reasoning is that they are not required to interact with NETs.
Extract 20:
“I had this, you know, preconceived notion like, oh man, they don't like foreigners […] And I
was like, no, uhm, they're not really required to deal with us, you know.” (Luke)
4.2.2) Theme Two: Suppressing Emotions to Focus on Student Well-Being
There were patterns in the data where NETs suppressed their own emotions to ensure the
well-being of their students. The emotional labour experience by NETs are discussed below
as subthemes of theme two.
4.2.2.1) Deep Acting
Some NETs used deep acting and emotional intelligence to ensure that they are patient with
students in the English classroom. Through inner dialogue NETs suppressed their emotion of
impatience with students, as evident in Extract 21. Through Luke’s pep talk he works to
internally change his emotions, ensuring student well-being.
Extract 21:
“[...] pep talk, kind of like, hey, like, you know, it's not that, it's not that bad. Like they're,
they're just learning, there's nothing more that I can do to make their, make this learning
transition for them better.” (Luke)
However, in Extract 22 Jay stated that she suppresses her emotions through inner dialogue,
although she does not seem to have a method of releasing her consolidated emotions.
Extract 22:
“I don't really express outwardly. Uhm, so, I would kind of, you know, have inner dialogue
outside[...]” (Jay)
4.2.2.2) Surface Acting
Some NETs discussed how they mask their true emotions by wearing a mask that portrays
favourable emotions, however their mask starts to wear thin as their genuine emotion
become stronger. They acknowledged that students could see hints of their emotion as their
masks started to wear thin. However, through their emotional intelligence they were aware
that their emotions had to be managed to conform to the emotional rules of the workplace.
In Extract 23, Luke compared surface acting to a poker face, and acknowledged that the
younger the students are the stronger the poker face has to be.
Extract 23:
“[...] you gotta keep a smile on your face. You know, um, when you're feeling, even when you
feel like crap, you know, just, you know, especially with the younger they are, the stronger
your poker face gotta be.” (Luke)
In Extract 24, Jo-Ann stated that she attempts to mask her emotions, however it proves to
be difficult as they are reflected on her face.
Extract 24:
“[…] Uhm, and I try not to be- to lose my cool at the moment, but also with me you can see
everything that's going on, on my face.” (Jo-Ann)
4.2.3) Theme Three: NET Emotions in the Classroom
There were patterns where NETs experienced frustration and anxiousness in their
classrooms. The subthemes of theme three are discussed below.
4.2.3.1) Frustration with Discipline
Frustration with the lack of student discipline was stated as a factor influencing the
emotional labour of NETs. The frustration from one class that has discipline issues influences
the instructional tools of NETs for their upcoming classes, as NETs want to avoid any similar
disruption from students. In Extract 25, James described his methodological process of
preparing for his next class when a previous class has been misbehaving, to avoid any similar
emotions of frustration.
Extract 25:
“Depends on the next class. Because if you're going to from a bad class to another bad class,
then it's not going to be a good time. Then you like, have to think on your feet of like, okay,
how can I teach them the lesson? ” (James)
In Extract 26, Jay expressed that she is too exhausted to deal with disruptive students and
she suppresses her emotions by taking a teacher-centred approach to learning.
Extract 26:
“[...] that's frustrating when students disrupt your class or when you just feel like ah, you're
tired and you don't have energy to deal with students” (Jay)
4.2.3.2) Emotional Labour and Co-teachers
Through the years of suppressing their emotions, some NETs felt that they have finally had
enough. Some NETs sought support from their superiors or co-teachers when they felt
anxious or uncomfortable in their classroom setting. In Extract 27, Jo-Ann spoke about the
years of suppressing her frustration towards being a teacher’s assistant in the classroom
and when she finally spoke about her frustration with her co-teachers, they supported her
with her change in roles.
Extract 27:
“And then after two years I spoke up, I said, “No, I can’t do this anymore” uhm, because I am
just standing around doing nothing.” (Jo-Ann)
However, in Extract 28 the same cannot be said for Jay as she sought assistance from her
principal, but her wishes were unfruitful. She continues to suppress her frustration as she
does not have any sources of support or assistance.
Extract 28:
“Well, the, uh, principal, I haven't said it, like, specifically to my, my supervisor at my main
school- I haven't told her specifically because I don't want to, to make it a, you know, a big
problem. But I think they put me in the computer room, I think because they had no other
room to put me in [...]” (Jay)
4.2.4) Theme Four: The Impact of Korean Culture on NETs
The Korean culture has had a significant impact on the emotions of NETs and how they
navigate their work environment. The subthemes of theme four are discussed below.
4.2.4.1) Clash of Cultures in the Work Environment
Western ideologies and social norms of NETs clash with Korean culture. NETs are expected
to conform to Korean culture, although it has been met with resistance from NETs. They are
further isolated in their role where they harbour feelings of exclusion, primarily when it
comes to work colleagues. In Extract 29, Luke spoke about the rejection that he felt from
work colleagues due to his religious belief.
Extract 29:
“So, that can be more stressful than like the teaching part, because then I got a, I always got
a decline. And the principle, he told everyone that I'm a Muslim, and that I don't drink. And
even though the teachers, they've accepted it, like I can tell they're not happy about it.”
(Luke)
In Extract 30, Ashlee described her frustration at being excluded with last-minute changes in
Extract 30:
“[...] we call them Korean surprises, for example [...] my first couple of years teaching public
school, and I wouldn't know that there was an assembly or something. So, I'd be waiting for
the students to come [...]” (Ashlee)
4.2.4.2) the Impact of Junuk on NETs
Some work colleagues are reluctant to interact with the NET at their school because of
foreigner resistance, which is embedded in Korean culture and language. There is an
inherent division between Korean colleagues and NETs inside and outside of the classroom,
which exacerbates the emotions of NETs in terms of inadequacy and exclusion. NETs
suppress these emotions due to the emotional rules of the work environment, by masking
their genuine emotions. In Extract 31, Luke discussed the history of Korean civilization and
how it relates to the reluctance from Koreans to speak English. Luke stated that the use of
the possessive pronoun uri (our) in conversation draws a line between this is ours (Korean)
and this is yours (foreigner).
Extract 31:
“And so, I think as a result of that history, you know, I'm not pardoning their behaviour, but
I'm just, I'm saying that I understand it, that they still maintain this high level of, uhm,
rejection when it comes to dealing with foreigners and speaking English [...] when they say
Korean, they, they call it Hangug-eo, but Koreans don't use that expression. They say uri-
mal.” (Luke describing the dual words used to define the word Korean)
In Extract 32, Sammy highlighted how English speaking is avoided by Korean co-teachers.
Extract 32:
“I want to emphasize on the audio because, uh, since they are not native English speakers or
teachers, uhm, many of the teachers are not confident in the pronunciation, or in
constructing sentences, or explaining the lesson to the learners in English “(Sammy)
CHAPTER 5
Discussion
Chapter 5 will explore and discuss the research questions in relation to the Results in
Chapter 4 and the Literature Review in Chapter 2. The analysis of the results and literature
will guide the researcher in the critical evaluation of the research questions. The following
research questions (as identified in Chapter 2) will be discussed in this chapter: 1) How does
emotion and identity tensions intertwine to influence the pedagogical well-being of NETs
within rural public elementary schools in South Korea? 2) How does emotional labour
influence the pedagogical well-being of NETs within rural public elementary schools in South
Korea?
5.1) How does emotion and identity tensions intertwine to influence the pedagogical well-
being of NETs within rural public elementary schools in South Korea?
From the patterns identified in the data, it was evident that the emotions of NETs
intertwined with their identity influencing their pedagogical well-being; relating to the four
components identified in the Teacher Pedagogical rubric by Soini et al. (2010). Most of the
NETs identified as an English teacher in their schools compared to a teacher’s assistant
(Appendix F) which was surprising as they are hired by the government as teacher assistants
who are required to conduct their English classes with their Korean co- teacher (Lee & Jang,
2023). NETs stated how they identify in their workplace (Appendix F), which assisted the
researcher in understanding how their knowledge is constructed in shaping their
professional identity.
The results in 4.1.1, identified the curriculum as a factor in hindering the development and
growth of NET professional identity. The curriculum was criticised for its’ lack of support in
enforcing the role of the NET, which is to enhance the English communicative abilities of
students. Shin (2007) discussed the goal of the South Korean English curriculum which is to
develop independent and coherent users of English, although there seems to be tensions
between the NETs and the prescribed curriculum in achieving this goal. The emotions of
NETs that were identified in the study were frustration, annoyance and possibly resentment
towards the English curriculum, as most NETs critiqued it as unconducive towards EL
learning.
Sammy and James spoke about the obscured image that they are portrayed as only a game
teacher due to the emphasis by co-teachers and students on the games part of the lesson.
Zambrana-Ortiz (2011) discussed the cognitive dissonance of a teacher who felt that their
role in the classroom was that of performer, which led to them questioning their identity in
the classroom. Sammy and James expressed anger, frustration and even feelings of hurt
towards their perceived role from colleagues and students, which exacerbated the strain of
wanting to be viewed and respected as an English teacher. James stated that he is seen as a
toy and Sammy stated that she wanted English to be viewed not only as a game class but a
learning class. It is evident that there is a cognitive dissonance between their self-worth and
their identity.
Schumann (2019) discussed the complexities of categorising emotional labels and how these
labels are learned from a young age through their native language. The perception of NETs
being a game teacher is instilled through the Korean social hierarchy, which is further
exacerbated by Korean teachers. The consequences are that NETs feel pressurised into
fulling an undesirable role, which leads to demotivation and reluctance in classroom
participation.
Even though it is a requirement for a Korean co-teacher to be present in English classes,
most NETs are finding themselves having to do their co-teachers work and their own as
evident in the results of 4.1.2. The NET finds themselves at two opposing ends; where they
must focus on the communicative abilities of students as well as ensuring that meaning is
conveyed effectively to students. Tracey and Luke discussed their autonomy in the
classroom and how they have built a stronger relationship and rapport with students,
through the language exchange of Korean and English. It has positively influenced their
pedagogical well-being in terms of interactions with students and developing instructional
tools. It is also evident that there is a shift in their role where they develop as an English as a
Second Language (ESL) teacher, and not necessarily as the ubiquitously labelled term Native
English Teacher (NET).
Hwang and Yim (2019) discussed the preconceived idea that Koreans view foreign teachers
as unqualified because they are primarily hired due to their English linguistic competence,
although it is evident that NETs can grow and develop in their classroom environment when
a climate of NET professional development is fostered. Furthermore, the term Native
English Teacher should be replaced with the term English as a Second Language teacher (ESL)
because it is not the English linguistic competence of NETs that conveys meaning to
students, but rather their tacit knowledge of EL teaching, where they adopt the role of an
ESL teacher. It is of significance to note that neither the language barrier nor teaching
incompetence was the main cause in debilitating the NET’s professional identity, but rather
it was their interactions with colleagues.
In the results of 4.1.3, some NETs found it to be a rewarding experience to create their own
curriculum or lesson plans because they could break away from the restrictions of the
prescribed curriculum and develop their own instructional tools; showcasing their teaching
abilities. However, Jay found it to be a daunting task to take on the leadership position in
the classroom, as she views herself as a teacher’s assistant and finds it difficult to venture
outside of the confines of her role. She has constructed her identity as an assistant teacher,
which has consequently led to her frustration and annoyance of after-school classes, as they
are outside of the curriculum and her required role. However, her sentiments are justified
as NETs are employed as assistant teachers with limited roles (Lee & Jang, 2023). Her
emotion of frustration has intertwined with her identity as an assistant teacher which has
negatively affected her pedagogical well-being in terms of student interaction and the
development of instructional tools.
It is evident that once NETs construct their professional identity in their workplace, it is
fixed and difficult for them to change because emotion and identity tensions intertwine
creating resistance to the unfamiliar.
The lack of collaboration between Korean staff and NETs have created an environment
where there are undertones of a lack of cohesion and resistance towards EL attainment as
evident in the results of 4.1.4. Nazari and Karimpour (2022) discussed the complex
oscillating identities of teachers in the classroom, especially when classes are observed by
superiors. Jay spoke about having to adapt to each teacher’s teaching style, and Luke spoke
about the classroom climate changing when the Korean homeroom teacher is present. The
adaption to multiple co-teachers’ teaching styles and the change in classroom environment
indicates that it is necessary for the NET to create multiple identities in different contexts,
which is an overwhelming task. Wolff and De Costa (2017) stated that changes in teacher
identity will lead to modifications in teaching strategies, especially when adjusting to a new
teaching context. It is evident that the continuous change in the work environment means
that the professional identity of NETs is lost amongst the multiple layers of adaption to their
roles.
The emotions of being overwhelmed or discomfort in the classroom has led to the
construction of multiple NET identities (which will be discussed further in 5.2) which in
effect has created ambivalent emotions in students. Luke noted the difference in student
behaviour when he teaches with a Korean co-teacher in their homeroom compared to when
he teaches autonomously in his own classroom; where students are shy and resistant to
speak in front of their Korean homeroom teacher and they are interactive and relaxed in his
classroom. Benesch (2019) stated that emotions are socially and culturally formed and
mediated by higher powers, which in this case indicates that the emotions of Korean
students are embedded socially and culturally within their environment. It is evident that
due to Korean social culture, the Korean co-teacher holds the power in the classroom and is
power struggle between the NET trying to solidify their role and the inherent power of the
Korean co-teacher in the classroom.
Thus, having the support from Korean work colleagues is crucial in the Korean social context,
although many NETs spoke about the lack of support towards EL learning. Jay stated that
there were not any support structures or guidelines in place when she first arrived at her
school, and Luke stated that there was a lack of support for the use of English outside of the
classroom. Frustration, annoyance and discontent brews within the schools of NETs as they
were placed there by the government for a purpose- to enhance English communication, yet
they do not have any support from their schools. Management support, support from
colleagues and student engagement are the cornerstones of pedagogical well-being
(Murphy et al., 2020).
The lackadaisical attitude of the school environment towards EL learning and the frustration
of NETs due to the lack of support causes internal friction and inner dialogue, where NETs
begin to grasp the reality that they are in control of the route towards EL learning. The NETs
decide whether they conform to the standards of their schools or resist and voice their
concerns as Jo-Ann (pg.66).
5.2) How does emotional labour influence the pedagogical well-being of NETs within rural
public elementary schools in South Korea?
In the results of 4.2.1, it was discovered that the NETs in this study preferred to be isolated
within their work environment, which was surprising as it was projected in a positive light
rather than a negative one by participants. Jay and Jo-Ann felt that isolating themselves
from co-teachers was beneficial towards their mental well-being. Jo-Ann spoke about
isolating herself due to workplace gossip, and Jay spoke about the discomfort of the work
office due to the social atmosphere that she is excluded from because of the language
barrier. It was stated that emotion is as a response impacted by the social environment
(Zembylas, 2005).
Jo-Ann and Jay have been working at their schools for 5 years (Appendix F) and their
responses to their school social environment is isolation, which is a learned response. The
deliberate isolation by Jay and Jo-Ann has been portrayed as intertwining with the
emotional rules of their school environment; where it is portrayed as appropriate behaviour.
It is suggested that the avoidance of work colleagues allows the NET to avoid the emotional
labour of masking their genuine feelings, for example Jay spoke about avoiding the
incomprehensibility of Korean and the discomfort that she cannot participate in
conversation. Jo-Ann avoids workplace gossip and the uneasiness of it. Although most NETs
have made the deliberate choice of isolation, overcoming alienation has proved to be more
challenging for them; in terms of emotional labour.
NETs have felt a detachment in the Korean work environment, due to the loosely used term
foreigner (Howard, 2019). Jo-Ann stated that the lack of acknowledgment she receives from
work colleagues is “insensitive” (pg. 65) as she is identified daily by her school as “foreigner”.
This familiar occurrence in the workplace must be emotionally taxing on her where she
must suppress her genuine emotions and feelings towards the contentious use of the word
“foreigner”, due to the emotional rules of the workplace. Luke bluntly stated that he first
assumed that Koreans did not like foreigners, but after some thought he realised that
Koreans are not required to deal with the NET, in the sense that close relationships are
generally not formed due to the high-turnover rate of NETs. Zein and Butler (2022)
discussed the high turnover rate amongst NETs where yearly contracts were stated as one
of the reasons. It was evident that the distance between the NET and their Korean work
colleagues feeds into a vicious cycle of NET alienation. This invisible line serves as a constant
reminder of NET alienation, where emotions of inadequacy and isolation are instilled.
In the results of 4.2.2, it was evident that most NETs suppressed their emotions to fulfil their
duties of ensuring student well-being in the classroom. The NETs discussed the use of
surface and deep acting to remain within the scope of the emotional rules of the classroom.
Luke spoke about his “pep talk” and the strength of his “poker face” (pg.66) to suppress his
genuine emotions in favour of student well-being. The deep acting (pep talk) and surface
acting (poker face) is controlled through Luke’s emotional intelligence of suppressing his
genuine emotions of annoyance or frustration for enthusiasm. Jay used inner dialogue to
navigate difficult situations, however her emotions remain bottled up inside as she stated
that she does not express her emotions “outwardly” (pg.66). The impact of carrying the
burden of emotions is mentally exhausting and can affect her well-being. The management
of emotions through surface and deep acting can lead to burnout (Näring et al., 2006). Jay
escapes the mental pressures of her work environment by sitting in the sun, however she
does not have a specified means of dealing with her emotions which could be a sign of
burnout.
Jo-Ann stated that she tries to suppress her genuine emotions in the classroom, although it
is unsuccessful as her emotions are displayed on her face; where they are detectable for
students. As the poker face of Jo-Ann and Luke starts wearing thin, they stated that it was
actually beneficial to classroom management because students could recognise hints of
their frustration, annoyance or anger; shifting students’ perspectives of them. Perhaps the
shift of perspective highlights that students view them in a different light; they are not
solely there for their entertainment but that they are human, too and should be respected.
In the results of 4.2.3, it was evident that Jay and James are suffering from mental and
physical exhaustion due to the difficulties that they are experiencing in classroom
management. They discussed how a lack of classroom discipline impacts the burden of
emotional labour, but what was interesting to note is how they carry this emotional burden
throughout their various English classes. When students are misbehaving or not
participating in lessons, it leads to a teacher-centred approach where they adapt their
lesson plans to decrease the burden of emotional labour (Kim & Kim, 2018). James stated
that if one class is bad, it influences his lesson planning for his next class where he makes
quick changes to it; easing his emotional labour. Jay mentioned that she complained to the
school principal about the difficulties of teaching after-school classes in the computer room,
however it was brushed aside, resulting in her feeling tired and unmotivated in her class.
A teacher-centred approach is likely to be chosen when teachers lack the support from
members of the school community (Soini et al., 2010) It is evident that when NETs are
struggling to enforce discipline in the classroom they carry a large burden of emotional
labour, in which repeated stress can lead to burnout (Näring et al., 2006). Issues with
discipline affects the emotional labour of NETs which affect their teaching methods by
leaning towards a more teacher-centred approach. It is interesting to note how the attitude
of students changed when the NET expressed hints of unpleasant emotion, when elements
of discipline came from the NET and not their Korean co-teacher.
In the results of 4.2.4 it was evident that Korean culture and history plays a significant role
in affecting the emotions of NETs. Barrett (2017) stated that power, ideology and culture
creates an emotional discourse that teachers can either participate in or resist. The
emotional discourse of Korean culture is present in the excerpts of Luke and Ashlee. Luke
discussed Korean staff dinners and the pressure of partaking in drinking activities because it
is engrained in Korean society, although it creates tensions between himself and colleagues
because he does not partake in it due to his own culture and belief. Luke does not succumb
to the Korean societal pressures, which leaves him as an outsider. There seems to be
pressure to conform to Korean cultural norms otherwise one is regarded as an outsider,
which leaves unpleasant complex emotions. Ashlee spoke about the last minute unexpected
changes in the school timetable which is a normal occurrence in the Korean work culture,
although these changes were never explicitly communicated to her, leaving her feeling
frustrated and annoyed as she had prepared a lesson. These cultural tensions further isolate
Luke and Ashlee in their role due to their resistance to conform to Korean social norms.
There are emotional tensions between their own cultural beliefs and conforming to Korean
beliefs.
Luke further explained how Korean culture and especially the Korean language is embedded
with foreigner rejection, through explaining the rich history of Korean civilisation. He
explained that there are two variations of the word Korean, but the one variation that is
commonly used is with the possessive pronoun our; signifying possession. This possessive
pronoun is used throughout the Korean language, which explains the division between
foreigners and Koreans. It gives the impression that foreigners cannot be fully integrated
within Korean society, as foreigner resistance is embedded within their ideologies and
language. A Korean word that highlights unease when speaking English is Junuk, which was
evident in the results. Sammy highlighted that Korean co-teachers are reliant on using the
audio for the English textbooks as they are resistant to speak English, even though Sammy is
present in the English classroom to assist with any EL difficulties. There is a clear division in
the classroom which leaves emotional tensions of NET inadequacy.
It seems that most NETs understand Korean culture and the sacrifices that must be made by
them to teach English in South Korea, which is their well-being. NETs critique of Korean
teaching methodologies and work environment go unheard, thus they begin to assimilate
and accommodate Korean culture through inner dialogue and emotional control. In Chapter
3, it seemed as if the NETs were lifting a burden off their shoulders through the SSI, and
perhaps it is because they could finally remove their masks and give an honest opinion of
their work environment. Soini et al. (2010) discussed the contradictory nature of the school
environment, where there are instances of avoidance, opposition and resistance. Through
the emotional labour of remaining complacent at their schools, it becomes difficult for the
NET to form authentic work relationships and collaborate with colleagues, which hinders
the cohesiveness of the school environment in student teaching.
5.3) Limitations
The number of participants in this study were relatively small with only 7 participants. Some
of the participant’s audio conversation lasted less than 60 minutes, however they provided
rich and in-depth data. In the future, the researcher could advertise the research to not only
currently employed NETs in public rural elementary schools, but also open it to NETs who
have worked at a public rural elementary schools; allowing for a wider scope of research
from a much larger variety of participants. The researcher being an NET herself allows for
bias towards certain topics in the research, although the researcher was fully transparent
throughout the entire research process by describing how her role as a NET influenced the
research topic. It was also the researcher’s first time using the thematic analysis, where she
had some difficulties in labelling variables and putting them under a theme due to the
similarities of multiple variables.
CHAPTER 6
Conclusion
The researcher aims to comprehend and understand the intricacies of the emotions of NETs
and their influence on English classrooms in South Korea in the context of rural public
elementary schools. The research questions (from the standpoint of what emotions do in
rural public elementary schools) and the results of Chapter 4 were discussed in Chapter 5 in
relation to the Literature review of Chapter 2. Chapter 6 will conclude this study by
highlighting the main results and answers on this study. It is evident that within the teacher
pedagogical well-being rubric by Soini et al. (2010) the components of interactions with
students and colleagues were primarily affected by the emotion of NETs.
6.1) Research Topic
‘Pedagogical well-being of NETs (Native English Teachers) teaching ESL (English as a Second
Language) at rural public elementary schools in South Korea’.
6.2) Research Questions
1. How does emotion and identity tensions intertwine to influence the pedagogical
well-being of NETs within rural public elementary schools in South Korea?
2. How does emotional labour influence the pedagogical well-being of NETs within
rural public elementary schools in South Korea?
6.3) Main Results of Research Question 1
The first research question discovers that the choice that the NET makes in either
identifying as an English teacher or a teacher’s assistant (Appendix F) plays an important
role in understanding how they construct their knowledge and how their emotions
intertwine or clash with their self-defined professional identity, which consequently affects
their pedagogical well-being. Furthermore, the English curriculum creates tension and puts
pressure on the self-defined identity of the NET; hindering their professional development.
Their emotions of frustration, annoyance and resentment towards the curriculum has been
exacerbated by student perception that they are solely a game teacher. The perception of
being a game teacher by students challenges the identity of the NET, which inherently
intertwines with their emotions; resulting in demotivation and a reluctance to participate in
the English classroom.
NETs who are autonomous in the selection of their teaching methods form closer bonds to
their students in the classroom. However, it is noted that once an NET has settled into their
role and identity in the classroom, it is difficult for them to navigate past that role and into
the unknown. NETs are hired as teacher assistants, although most of them identify as
English teachers and act in the full capacity of an English teacher. Those who identify as
teacher assistants either find it challenging to navigate outside of their role or they want to
break free from the confines of their role. Emotions of resistance and frustration are
present, which affect pedagogical well-being in terms of student interaction and the
development of instructional tools.
The lack of cohesion amongst multiple Korean co-teachers and NETs, results in the identity
of NETs becoming lost amongst the layers of adaption. The emotions of NETs lead to the
construction of multiple identities that result in ambivalent emotions in students as the role
of the NET becomes obscured to them. It is imperative to mention that Korean co-teachers
hold the power in the classroom due to Korean societal and hierarchical norms.
Furthermore, when the NET co-teaches with their Korean co-teacher, they lose that power
affecting their emotions. It is evident that emotions of overwhelmingness, frustration and
isolation intertwine with the construction of multiple NET identities; affecting NET
pedagogical well-being in terms of lacking cohesion with co-teachers, which directly affects
student motivation.
Thus, it is imperative to have the support of Korean co-teachers and work colleagues
towards EL learning. However, some NETs state that they lack the support of work
colleagues towards the attainment of EL learning in the school environment. The emotions
of frustration, annoyance and discontent brews within NETs until they reach a point of
realisation that they are actually in control of the route towards EL learning at their
schools. The NET decides whether he/she conforms to the standards of EL at his/her school
or whether he/she resists and voice his/her opinion.
6.4) Main Results of Research Question 2
It is surprising to see that NETs prefer isolation at their schools as they want to avoid the
emotional labour of masking their genuine emotions. Deliberate isolation is a learned
response from NETs where it has formed part of the emotional rules of the workplace, due
to the norm of isolating from work colleagues. Alienation on the other hand has proven to
be more of a contentious subject for NETs. The occasional use of the word foreigner to
identify NETs leads to feelings of unease as it alludes to foreigner rejection, which provokes
feelings of exclusion. This distance between NETs and work colleagues feeds into the vicious
cycle of NET alienation and encourages NET isolation.
It is evident that NETs suppress their emotions through surface and deep acting, where it
affects their mental and physical well-being. Furthermore, the use of a pep talk and a poker
face are used to suppress genuine emotions in favour of student well-being. Hence, it is an
exhausting task to have inner dialogue with oneself and mask one's emotion, ultimately
becoming a burden for the NET. It is interesting to note the change in attitude of students
when the mask of the NET starts to fade and they realise that the NET is not solely there for
entertainment purposes, but they are a teacher as any other teacher at their school.
The lack of support from school superiors in fulfilling the needs of NETs when it comes to
complaints about discipline and student management can lead to a teacher-centred
approach by NETs, as they are tired and unmotivated in the classroom. Moreover, NETs who
struggle to enforce discipline in the classroom carry the burden of emotional labour where
repeated stress can cause burnout. It is interesting to see how the emotional labour of one
class can influence other classes, where the NET strategically changes their teaching
methods to ease their emotional labour.
Korean societal norms and culture are embedded within their language and ideologies. NETs
find themselves under pressure to conform to Korean societal norms even if it goes against
their own beliefs. The resistance from NETs towards conforming to Korean culture and
social norms is met with an iron first from Korean work colleagues, which results in the NET
becoming an outsider in the work environment. The history of Korean civilisation puts
together pieces of the puzzle in explaining foreigner rejection, where the use of the
possessive pronoun “our” is commonly used in conversation amongst Koreans. This division
leaves emotions of inadequacy, where the NET determines that they must sacrifice their
own well-being to teach English in South Korea. Hence, NETs assimilate into Korean society
through inner dialogue and emotional intelligence. The NETs emotional labour of rejection
hinders the opportunity to form authentic relationships amongst colleagues.
6.5) Recommendations for future research
There should be sufficient training and guidelines for Korean teachers on how to
successfully integrate NETs into the school environment. Furthermore, there should be
sufficient NET guidelines on teaching methodologies and strategies for EL attainment in all
four components (listening, speaking, reading and writing) as it seems that most schools are
completely reliant on the NET to teach beyond communication. Future research can
investigate how to incorporate these components into ESL training for NETs at their
respective schools, as NETs possess a bachelor’s degree in any subject (Choi, 2022).
A nationwide strategy needs to be enforced where NETs and their co-teachers understand
their roles and the nationwide goal of EL acquisition in South Korea. Moreover, workshops
and training where NETs and Korean co-teachers can collaborate on ideas and discuss
teaching strategies openly to overcome the barriers of junuk and foreigner alienation. This
research could be further extended to urban schools to compare the pedagogical well-being
of urban and rural NETs, to evaluate their well-being on a nationwide scale and to find
solutions towards enforcing a nationwide strategy of EL in South Korea.
6.6) Reflection
This research process has been an enjoyable journey as it was an opportunity to learn about
the researching field and to gain insight/experience into the intricacies of conducting
research. As I have been teaching at a rural public elementary school for a number of years,
I find myself questioning educational policies and teaching methods in the classroom. This
research topic gave me the opportunity to explore within my field and dissect layers of
knowledge that is of interest to me. This study gave me clarity on contentious topics (such
as co-teachers, a need for independency, teaching methodologies etc...) that are always
brought up in conversation with other NETs. It is highlighted that NETs are often overlooked
in research, but this research gave them the opportunity to delve deep into their thoughts
and voice their opinions towards ESL teaching at rural public elementary schools in South
Korea.

Pedagogical wellbeing of Native English Teachers (NETs) in the ESL classroom in rural public
elementary schools in South Korea
This study is being conducted as part of my, MSc Degree dissertation in the TESOL
department at the University of St Andrews.
I invite you to participate in a research project about the impact of identity and emotion on
the pedagogical wellbeing of Native English Teachers (NETs) in South Korea teaching at rural
public elementary schools and sponsored under an E-2 visa. The study will involve
understanding the emotions of the NETs, the cause and how they are managed by NETs in
their working environment in South Korea. This research will take place through a telephone
interview conducted by the researcher. The audio of the interview will be recorded, and the
data will be used for analysis into the investigation of NETs emotions and identity. The
research will be ethically conducted, and the results of participants will be pseudonymised.
Eligible participants should be currently employed at a public rural elementary school in
South Korea and be under an E-2 visa.
If you are interested, please get in contact using the details below. You will then be given a
Participant Information Sheet that further details my research and have the opportunity to
ask any questions, before being asked whether you consent to participate.
Thank you, your participation will be appreciated.

Appendix B: Participation Information
Participant Information
Pedagogical wellbeing of NETs in South Korea
What is the study about?
I invite you to participate in research about the impact of their professional identity and
emotions on the wellbeing of Native English Teachers (NETs) in South Korea. The study aims
to uncover emotions of NETs teaching at rural public elementary schools, the cause of these
emotions and how they are managed by NETs in their working environment in South Korea.
Why have I been invited to take part?
You have been invited to participate in this study because you are a Native English Teacher
sponsored under an E-2 visa, by a public rural elementary school in South Korea.
Do I have to take part?
This information sheet has been written to help you decide if you would like to take part. It
is up to you and you alone whether you wish to take part. If you do decide to take part, you
will be free to withdraw at any time without providing a reason and with no negative
consequences.
What would I be required to do?
You will be required to partake in an interview and answer questions regarding your work
environment and your role as a NET in the classroom. The interview will be conducted by a
mobile phone call, which will be recorded to capture the data. The data will be transcribed
to a Word document and analysed. You can withdraw from the interview at any time and
withdraw consent. The interview duration will be 60 minutes and 10 minutes extra if the
participant has any questions.
Are there any risks associated with taking part?
There is the inconvenience of time for the participant as the interview can take up to 70
minutes. The discussion of any negative work experiences or memories can be mitigated by
the participant by withdrawing from the research or moving on to the next question if they
wish. The identity of the participant will be concealed by omitting the school name and
names of colleagues in the research.
Are there any benefits associated with taking part?
There are no direct benefits in this study. The research allows for the perspectives and
opinions of NETs to be voiced, in the context of their teaching and work environment in
South Korea. Participants have the freedom to voice their professional opinions on content
and context matters, wherein they are usually unasked. The study can also assist in
identifying gaps and pitfalls in the implementation of NETs in rural public elementary
schools in South Korea.
Informed consent
It is important that you give your informed consent before taking part in this study. You will
have the opportunity to ask questions about the research before you provide your consent.
What information about me or recordings of me (‘my data’) will you be collecting?
I will be collecting data through semi-structured interviews with participants, where the
data will be pseudonymised, and participants cannot name the names of co-workers or
schools by name during the interview. The semi-structured interviews will be recorded via
the phone setting, and manually transcribed by hand onto a Word document on the
University Network. Participants will be reminded at the start of the interview that they will
be recorded. The interviews will be deleted from the phone immediately, once it has been
transferred to the University Network. The data will be stored on an encrypted and
password-controlled network, which is only accessible by the researcher. The semi-
structured interviews will be used in thematic analysis to identify any prevalent themes in
the data, NVivo software will be used to analyse the data. The data will only be shared with
my supervisor (XXX). The recorded audio will be deleted from the cell phone once it has
been transcribed to a Word document on the university OneDrive, which is encrypted, and
password protected. The pseudonymisation ‘key’ will be stored separately on my Home
drive.
Terms used to describe your data
In the next sections I will describe how your data will be stored, used, and shared. I will use
these terms to describe what form your data will be in:
• Pseudonymised – means that your data will be edited so that you are referred to by
a unique reference such as a code number or different name, and the original data will be
either deleted or only available to certain individuals. There will be a ‘key’ document, which
will link your unique reference to your real identity. The key will be kept in a secure location,
where only certain individuals will have access to it and be able to reconnect your data to
you later. If this key is deleted your data becomes ‘anonymised’.
How will my data be stored and who will have access to it?
The data will be stored in a Pseudonymised form, which means that the data will be edited
so that participants are referred to by a unique reference such as a code number or
different name, and their original data will be stored as a key separately on the hard drive.
The pseudonymised data will be stored on the encrypted and password-controlled
University Network. Only I will be able to access the data and share it with my supervisor
(XXX). The original data and ‘key’ document will be stored together, which will link
participants’ unique reference to their real identity. The key will be kept separately on my
home drive, and only I will have access to it and be able to reconnect participants’ data to
them at a later date.
Audio recordings will be taken on an encrypted device and transcribed at the earliest
opportunity before being destroyed.
How will my data be used and in what form will it be shared further?
Your research data will be analysed as part of the research study. It may then be published
in my dissertation. Data used in publications will be in Pseudonymised form. Only I will have
access to your data in Pseudonymised form.
It is expected that the project to which this research relates will be finalised by August 2024.
When will my data be destroyed?
The data will be retained until I have fully completed (including any grading and appeal
process) the assignment that this data will be used for, and then deleted.
Will my participation be confidential?
Yes, your participation will only be known to the researcher, who will have access to
identifiable research data, consent forms, or participants’ contact details.

Appendix G: Transcripts
Participant 1: Jo-Ann
Interviewer: Welcome to the interview, uhm, you can withdraw consent at any time, or you
can skip to the next question.
Jo-Ann: Okay, no problem.
Interviewer: Could you briefly tell me where you are from and for how long you have been
teaching at your current school?
Jo-Ann: Okay, I am from South Africa, and I’ve been teaching at this school, now, for five
years.
Interviewer: And you teach at a public rural elementary school?
Jo-Ann: Yes, I do.
Interviewer: Have you had any teaching experience prior to teaching at your current school?
Jo-Ann: No, this is my first public school job.
Interviewer: Why were you interested in applying to teach in a public school in South Korea?
Jo-Ann: Uhm, I wanted a, uhm, something more, uhm. I know that public jobs in Korea have
good benefits and, uhm, a set system, where you work for the government, so uhm, you
don’t have to fight about a lot of problems. Everything is set out.
Interviewer: And for how long have you been teaching at this school? For how many years?
Jo-Ann: Five years now.
Interviewer: What is your relationship like with your co-teacher?
Jo-Ann: Uhm, my relationship with my co-teachers, every year it changes. Because you
change co-teachers every year, but it’s been cordial, and it’s been good. Sometimes, it’s not
perfect but it’s been good.
Interviewer: And what is your role in the classroom?
Jo-Ann: It depends on the co-teacher, because I think at the moment, I have uhm six co-
teachers.
Interviewer: Oh, so with the homeroom teacher?
Jo-Ann: Yes, uhm, with my sixth-grade class I go to the home room teacher, uh, with my
third and fourth grade I’ve got one homer-Oh, yes and the sixth grade also I go to the
homeroom teacher. So, that is actually a lot of co-teachers.
Interviewer: Would you consider yourself to be an English Teacher or a Teacher assistant?
Jo-Ann: In the elementary school, I felt like a teacher’s assistant and because it depends on,
uhm, your co-teacher. Because some co-teachers want you to be involved in the planning of
the lessons, the others just want you to be there. And I am just in the background, “Okay
can you help me?” “Say this” or “Come play with the kids”. So, uhm, in the elementary
school it is (pause) then I felt like a teacher’s assistant. And I remember, I actually
complained about it after two years and then they just started giving me my own classes.
Interviewer: Can you describe your usual daily routine at work?
Jo-Ann: When it started, uhm, I would plan lessons and uhm we had this, uhm, system
where I would send them everything I wanted to do for the week, maybe the week before.
And then they would uhm, look at it, and choose some teachers would be like “Okay you do
what you want” other teachers would be like, no, I want you to do this, this, this. So, that
was, uhm, how we planned lessons. So, I would go to work, and I would uhm plan and I-I
would look through the lesson and decide okay I want to contribute this and then I would,
uhm, show it to my co-teacher and she would decide whether she wanted to use it or not.
Interviewer: So, you would do pre-planning and then you would get their approval?
Jo-Ann: Yes, that’s how it started off.
Interviewer: And uhm, when it comes to decision-making regarding the English curriculum,
tests, or lesson planning, are you actively involved?
Jo-Ann: Okay, uhm, with me I did that for two years where I wasn’t actively involved. And
then after two years I spoke up, I said, “No, I can’t do this anymore” uhm because I am just
standing around doing nothing. And then they actually heard, uhm, what I was saying and
then the next year they just gave me my own classes. So, I would teach, and they would
actually be the teacher’s assistants, which actually surprised me that they agreed to do that.
Interviewer: And do you think that you have contributed positively to the end goal of
enhanced English communication amongst students in the classroom, if yes how so?
Jo-Ann: Uhm, well when I was allowed to, to take the lead, uhm, I think I did, because then I
had more control over my lessons. So, I incorporated a whole lot of different things, which I
thought would get the kids, uhm, more involved and more engaged in the classroom. So, I
(pause) where we sang a lot, I added different ideas to the lesson, so yes, I think I have
contributed a lot in, uhm, helping the students with their English (chuckles) or yeah.
Interviewer: How do you think the subject English is perceived by colleagues and superiors
at your school?
Jo-Ann: Uhm, I think in Korean society, they take it uhm very seriously. Like it’s, it’s
something that they focus a lot on. So, uhm, from the teachers and the pressure that they
put on the students uhm I think as a second language uhm the focus is too intense. Uhm,
the (pause)
Interviewer: (interrupts) So (pause)
Jo-Ann: Yes
Interviewer: So, there’s mounting pressure from teachers for them to succeed in English?
Jo-Ann: Exactly, which I think is not really (pause) especially for even elementary school
students the pressure that they are under, I don’t think it’s necessary. Uhm, because second
languages are mainly used for communication and maybe sometimes academic purposes.
But I think that the pressure that I see here is a little bit unwarranted.
Interviewer: And how do they put the pressure on students? Through what means?
Jo-Ann: I think the testing system here (chuckles) where it’s a little bit, I think the scores
they expect the students to achieve and if they don’t achieve it, then I think they feel a little
bit uhm inadequate. So, I think it’s the pressure of the testing and the way that they test
students here.
Interviewer: And is this a testing system for elementary school students?
Jo-Ann: Yes, because I think uhm they, that, that it, it’s just a cultural uhm way that students
are expected to succeed in, all ways, all ways. So, even when we, when the children (pause)
some co-teachers would give the children vocabulary test weekly and they are expected to
get all of the answers correct. But, the method in which they are learning is also wrong,
because they are just (pause) uhm (pause) like memorizing and uhm without understanding
what’s going on. So, after the test nobody remembers anything about it. So, I think it’s just
the system they have here.
Interviewer: How do you think students perceive English?
Jo-Ann: Ah well, very negatively actually. If you look in a classroom, maybe 10-20 percent
are really interested, the other 80 percent are not. I think it’s all because there’s a lot of
pressure involved in it and all the extracurricular English activities and lessons that they
have to take, makes it, uhm, then they stop enjoying it because of the pressure.
Interviewer: So, it starts to feel like a burden perhaps, for the students?
Jo-Ann: Yes, I have heard elementary school students say, “Oh I really hate English, I really
hate it”. They don’t want to study it. So, that why you have to come up with engaging and
interesting lessons for them, I think
Interviewer: And does the way that students perceive English (positively or negatively)
affect you emotionally?
Jo-Ann: I wouldn’t say, you know emotionally. Not emotionally, not at all. I would like them
to enjoy the lessons but uhm I have never been emotionally affected by that.
Interviewer: When do you feel frustrated at work?
Jo-Ann: Not with my students, mostly with my co-teachers
Interviewer: Yes, you can elaborate on that, with co-teachers. When you feel frustrated.
Jo-Ann: Sometimes I feel frustrated, because I think but it’s all, it's, all personal dynamics.
It’s not got anything to do with teaching. I think it’s just sometimes they fail to understand
that uhm they you are also a human being, they only see you as an English teacher. They
don’t know that, maybe, you have a backstory, you have a life so a lot of things they don't
take into account, that, that frustrates me.
Interviewer: They are not seeing you as an actual human?
Jo-Ann: Yes, yes. Everything, I sometimes wonder whether they think that my life revolves
around just coming to teach them English everyday (chuckles).
Interviewer: And how do you deal with frustration at work, when you feel frustration with
colleagues, perhaps?
Jo-Ann: Well, it has been about five years, so I easily block out things. I just uhm focus on my
work and I sit in my zone. Do things that help me relax or, uhm, yes in my free time I listen
to music, or I read or I focus or other things that block out the noise of what’s going on
around me.
Interviewer: Do you try and suppress those feelings, sorry?
Jo-Ann: Yeah, yeah because uhm not suppress but ignore (chuckles).
Interviewer: And you were saying also, sorry?
Jo-Ann: Yeah and I also (pause). Okay I have lost my train of thought. But I'll come back to it
Interviewer: Okay.
Interviewer: What would you consider an ideal work environment?
Jo-Ann: I don’t think there is an ideal work environment, because you have to deal with
human beings. But, uhm, I think that an ideal work environment, if I have to choose, would
be one where I get to go to work, uhm, do my, uhm, have the freedom to do my tasks
without anybody worrying or micromanaging me- I think. But, also input, input from co-
workers is not a bad thing, it’s just negative input which is not helpful.
Interviewer: If you could elaborate on negative input, what do you mean by negative input?
Jo-Ann: I think, also, in the culture here is, uhm, they are not very straightforward. If
somebody has a problem with something, they won’t tell you straight, like, okay this is a
problem. Uhm, but, then they will complain about it, I don't know whether it is the culture
here where people aren’t used to giving advice or hearing, uhm, hearing ways of improving
things. So, you will find somebody will not tell you that they have a problem with something,
but then that breeds content because they have a problem with something, they will not
say it, but then they end up getting angry about it. And, you do not know why somebody is
upset. So, I think good communication is very important.
Interviewer: Do you think that differs from South Africa, the communication style?
Jo-Ann: Maybe, it’s a cultural thing, also. Because, I have had jobs where if you are not
doing something right, somebody will tell you, “This is not correct” or “Do it this way”.
Sometimes, it is helpful. But, here I think there is just, uhm, a culture of maybe, they
themselves are not even used to people, uhm, offering advice or telling them about
something, or sharing inputs. I found that a lot of my teachers are even afraid to ask you,
“Okay where did you get this information?” or “Can you help me with something?”. It’s, it’s
not a culture here, they don’t really ask or share, uhm, information at work.
Interviewer: Do you think maybe lacking sympathy?
Jo-Ann: Yes, I think so. Or just removed or detached from, uhm (pause)
Interviewer: From empathy?
Jo-Ann: Yeah, possibly empathy. That’s why I am saying that they don’t see me as a human
being, they just see me as, this, everything is on the surface. Uhm, people don’t really get to
know each other in a personal way, it’s very rare.
Interviewer: What would you consider a good day at work?
Jo-Ann: Uh, a good day at work, going to work, uhm, doing my work, uhm, engaging with
the students, because that is actually what I love about being a teacher. Having the time to
engage with my students, speak to them, have, have good relationships with my students is
actually the most important thing for me. Because uhm, you might have issues with your co-
workers but with the students if they are okay with what you are doing, then I think that’s a
bonus. So, an ideal day at work is always maintaining a good relationship with my students
and them enjoying the lessons that I have prepared.
Interviewer: What would you consider a bad day at work?
Jo-Ann: Uh, a bad day at work, maybe (pause) I don't think, think about it at all, every day is
different like I said, and you are dealing with people, with different personalities. So, I think
you have to understand that whatever might cause you to have a bad day, maybe the next
person is also going through some challenges. So, I just take it as, okay if this person is not in
a good mood, let me understand, maybe they are going through something. So, let me just
let it go. So, I don't, uhm, go to work planning on having a bad day. So, I never experience
those kinds of days. I might be upset for 3 minutes, but then I am over it, because I just have
to understand, okay I am dealing with another human being.
Interviewer: And the work structure, does that maybe play a role in having to suppress
genuine feelings?
Jo-Ann: Uhm (pause) yes, I think so. Like I said, the first two years were very challenging, but
then I spoke up about it. One day, I just said, “Okay, this is not working for me” and because
I spoke up about it, they understood. Because I think they could also see, about, because of
the work structure here, they don’t expect that anybody is going to speak up about
something. They didn’t expect that I would be like, okay, I would complain about, uhm, the
way the lessons were being conducted. So, they were like yes, we have also noticed that.
But, if you really genuinely have a problem with it, we will try and see how we can make it
better. So, then they did, and I was really happy about that.
Interviewer: I know you mentioned that you don’t really have bad days at work, but when
you have those times when are upset for those 3 minutes or 3 seconds, does it impact your
teaching capabilities or classroom environment?
Jo-Ann: Uh, well (pause) with my teachers, maybe. But, once I start a class, the students
make it more lively, like they change everything. That is one thing I love about being a
teacher, like the students are, just, that's, I never have a bad day (chuckles). Because I really
love kids.
Interviewer: So, they brighten your day?
Jo-Ann: (Chuckling) They always brighten my day, even if I am in a bad mood. Three minutes
into the class, I am already like, wow.
Interviewer: When you are having a good day at work, how does it impact your teaching
capabilities or classroom environment?
Jo-Ann: Oh, yes then we have a whole lot more fun. I feel more energetic, I might decide to
switch things around in the lesson. Also, depending on the mood of the students, how they
walk into the class. How are you going to adjust the lesson to get the students more
engaged? So, I think yes, If I am in a better mood, let’s change things around, and see how
to make the class a whole lot better.
Interviewer: What have you had to adopt or change about yourself to conform to Korean
standards or expectations in the classroom? If so, please explain.
Jo-Ann: Uhm, well the first thing is, when I originally moved to public school; I watched, and
I listened, and I learned. Even though I might not agree with everything, they have a system
with how they do things and, I guess the students are used to that system. So, you-it's good
to learn how they conduct their lessons and then add on. So, what I did was, I was open to
learning. I was telling my co-teacher that I actually learned a lot from them, just by watching
how they do things. I wasn’t a teacher in South Africa, so when I came here, I actually had to
learn- so I was open to learning and, uhm, we might have had our challenges, but I learned a
lot of things from them.
Interviewer: When you say system, what do you mean by “their system”?
Jo-Ann: The way that they conduct lessons, so for example, like, okay the, the lesson
structure, they have a way in which not all teachers do it the same way, some teachers just
follow the textbook, others add more interesting activities and ideas to their lessons. So, it’s
good to pick from different people, because not everybody conducts a lesson in the same
way. But at least look at the people who are, uhm, making it a success, who are having, uhm,
very engaging lessons. Get some ideas and learn from them how they do it. You might not
do it in the same way, but those ideas are helping the students learn. It could be useful, also,
when planning lessons because you see that, that's how the students actually learn.
Interviewer: Are your co-teachers only actively involved in the lesson when they have to
translate, maybe from Korean to English? Or how does that work, from the L1 to the L2? Do
you translate?
Jo-Ann: Some of them insist on translating, but I don’t always think it’s a good thing. But,
unless it is really, really important, that the students (pause). Because I think that the
students also have to get used to listening, and if they know that there is going to be
somebody to translate everything, they are not listening and they are not learning. So, I
prefer that the co-teachers don’t translate too much, unless the students are completely
lost.
Interviewer: How do you get meaning across to the students?
Jo-Ann: I think a lot of TPR, is it TPR? Yes, I do a lot of that. A lot of action, role-play, a lot of
modelling, all that kind of stuff. Especially, role-playing so that they can see how it's done
and follow and all of that stuff-actually- that is another thing that the co-teachers could be
useful for.
Interviewer: For role-playing?
Jo-Ann: Yes (chuckles), and for modelling activities.
Interviewer: When do you suppress unpleasant feelings?
Jo-Ann: Uh, when you have unruly students, of course, uhm, because you have to contain
yourself and try to stay calm as the adult in the classroom. So, yes during those times I just
have to, like okay, just calm myself down, uhm, and see how to manage those students.
Because in the end you have to look at their personalities and see okay, this child maybe is
just trying to seek attention or they have this problem, this is why they are unruly and then
try work it out, if you can (pause).
Interviewer: Yes, sorry?
Jo-Ann: Yes, yes so that is one time where I really, maybe not lose my cool, but it frustrates
me in the classroom.
Interviewer: How do you react to unpleasant feelings?
Jo-Ann: Uhm, well you can’t really react, because nobody wants an angry teacher. So, like
slightly punish the children, like, “Okay you don’t get this” or like “Okay, sit there”. Or move
them somewhere else away from where they are causing a distraction. I think those are
ways of dealing, but now you cannot really shout at students or lose your temper in the
classroom. I think that is no longer done.
Interviewer: How do you mitigate unpleasant feelings?
Jo-Ann: Uhm, stay calm (chuckles). Just stay calm and try to move my attention from that to
something else, and if I really can’t, then try to sort it out as soon as possible.
Interviewer: What is the impact of suppressing these unpleasant feelings at work?
Jo-Ann: Uhm, well, I have this-uhm- with my personality, I can’t keep something in for a long
time. So, if for example, something has happened with a teacher, I might not say it on the
day but in a week or two I will bring it up. Because I feel like I can’t move on if something
really bothers me, so I have to bring it up with them or discuss it with somebody else, so
that they can try and mediate the situation. So, if something really, really bothers me, I
always have to bring it up, because I also might have understood what happened, in a
wrong way. Sometimes you might realize that what you perceived is actually not what
happened, so I like to get it over and done with, and out of the way.
Interviewer: What is the benefit of suppressing your feelings at work?
Jo-Ann: Just, because you know that you are dealing with children, so, uhm, you don’t want
to be angry or apprehensive. You don’t want to show anger in front of them, so I think that’s
a benefit. You are dealing with children, so you are the adult. You have to find a way to
suppress anger or any negative feelings, thoughts or words.
Interviewer: Do you see yourself as resilient towards emotion or vulnerable?
Jo-Ann: Well, I think resilient, I put everything in a box and deal with it when I can. Uhm, and
I try not to be- to lose my cool at the moment, but also with me you can see everything
that's going on, on my face. So, I really have to stay calm (chuckles).
Interviewer: On your face, do the students pick that up? When you are angry?
Jo-Ann: Yes, so I don’t have to say much. They can just see my face, and they might start
behaving (chuckles).
Interviewer: And with co-teachers or colleagues if you are upset about something?
Jo-Ann: Yes, they have asked me many times in the class, “Oh, teacher, are you okay?” Then,
they seem very apologetic, but I didn’t say anything (chuckles). They say, “You don’t look
happy today, what’s wrong?” So, I can’t hide my facial expressions.
Interviewer: Ah, okay so it comes across not through words but through your facial
expressions?
Jo-Ann: Yes, and they are always asking, but sometimes I am already over it. Like, “Teacher,
oh, today, you really didn’t look happy, what’s wrong?”
Interviewer: What cultural differences have impacted your wellbeing in the workplace?
Jo-Ann: Uhm, I think with everywhere, the thing I hate most about the workplace is gossip.
Because I think it is very dangerous. So, that is why I remove myself from any personal
relationships, because I do not want any conflict as work. In some situations, here, uhm, it
has brought me actually a lot of peace to not engage in any gossip and any unnecessary
chatter.
Interviewer: Do you think that you are treated fairly at work, if not, how does it influence
your teaching and behavior at work?
Jo-Ann: I think not fairly, because there are instances where information gets to me at the
last second; which I think is really not fair and unprofessional. So, they will tell you
something five minutes before it happens, and then they will expect you to, uhm, to comply
with it. I have gotten to a space where not everything I can agree to. So, sometimes I say no
I can’t do that, I am sorry, uhm, but its continuous. It is just something that they do, and
they don’t realize that you might have a personal life or see you as a human being- there are
a lot of things that they overlook. Uhm, but I also think it is a cultural thing, I think in this
culture the work culture comes first in a lot of people’s lives. So, there isn’t so much of a
balance.
Interviewer: Do you think that they only see you as the foreigner teacher? Is there a gap
between the Korean teacher and the foreign teacher?
Jo-Ann: Yes, yes, uhm, like they will have discussions about me right in front of my face and
never ask my opinion. Uhm, which frustrates me, also. They will have a full-blown discussion,
where they come up with a problem-they come with a solution, without including me in the
discussion-that is something that really upsets me. Uhm, if you want to know something
why don’t you just ask? But people who have no idea what’s going on and making decisions
about it. That’s a little bit off putting.
Interviewer: Yes, maybe a bit insensitive?
Jo-Ann: Yes, very...
Interviewer: Yes, sorry?
Jo-Ann: Yes, yes, it is very insensitive- it happens every day. Somebody would just ask a
question about me, and they wouldn’t even use my name, they will just actually call me
foreign teacher.
Interviewer: Do you consider yourself to be part of a team with staff at school, if not, do you
make any attempts to “fit in” with colleagues?
Jo-Ann: Uhm, part of a team it depends on your co-teacher, part of a school team; they try
and include you but when it suits them. And sometimes, only including you will be for
exciting (pause) drinking activities, and if you don’t do that sort of thing, you might find that
you are then further excluded, which I don’t believe in going on drinking excursions with my
co-teachers. It’s sort of caused a little bit of a barrier between me and my co-workers, so,
uhm, yes in that way.
Interviewer: Do you have any questions for me about the research?
Jo-Ann: What is the research question?
Interviewer: It is about the pedagogical wellbeing of NETs in South Korea.
Jo-Ann: Okay, which is a very important thing.
Interviewer: About emotion, especially.
Jo-Ann: Yes, yes. Different environments. The thing about working here is that you might
get lucky or unlucky. I think that everyone’s situation is a little bit different.
Participant 2: Luke
Interviewer: Okay, you may withdraw your consent at any time, or you may skip to the next
question if you don't feel comfortable. So, my first question is, could you briefly tell me
where you are from and for how long you have been teaching at your current school?
Luke: So, uh, my name is Luke, for a quick intro again, uh, Luke Smith. Uhm, I'm from
America and I've been teaching at my school for five and a half years.
Interviewer: And have you had any teaching experience prior to teaching at your current
school?
Luke: Uh, yes, I do have teaching experience. And it started in X, and it began at a private
school, and this, this is my first p-p public school.
Interviewer: And you're teaching at a rural public elementary school?
Luke: Yes, I'm teaching at X elementary school. It's an elementary school.
Interviewer: Okay, thank you. And uhm, why were you interested in applying to teach in a
public school in South Korea?
Luke: Well, since my experience started at a private school and the workload was a lot, I
decided to (pause) make a change of (pause) of my working environment. And from what I
heard uh, other foreign teachers told me that the workload was lighter at a public school
and for the most part you don't have to deal with parents, because at the private uh private
schools, you know, they call them hagwons here, private academies, uhm, you're constantly
dealing with complaints from the parents. And this change of atmosphere was the best
decision I've made in Korea. And I recommend anyone, uh, who'd like to work in Korea as an
English teacher to start at a public school, public school.
Interviewer: So, at a public school, you feel like they don't have as much pressure from
parents interfering in your teaching abilities?
Luke: Uh, absolutely no pressure at all, yes.
Interviewer: And—
Luke: (interrupts) There's no influence, yes.
Interviewer: And what is your relationship like with your co-teacher?
Luke: Well, okay, well, since I have experience at both institutions, at the private (pause)
academies, you work closely with the uh, with the, uh, with the Korean teachers.
Interviewer: Yes.
Luke: Sometimes it's a bit strained because, you know, uh, again, they usually relay a lot of
the complaints they get from the parents from Korean and they translate them into English,
and (pause) they, they give constructive criticism. They give feedback, if you will, to try to
improve, uhm, the students' experiences and also to please the parents. And uh, obviously,
you know, I had made adjustments for them. But then when I compare that to the public
school, uhm, it’s very, uhm, our relationship is very loose and not very close. You don't work
with the, with the Korean staff, uhm, as close as you would at the public, uh, at the private
schools. And they, uhm, the-the-they kinda let me do my own thing, uh they’re, they’re very
uh, they’re not really involved in any teaching planning. Uh, they're not involved, I mean,
what they do is they send their kids down. Like, for example, let's say, like, at a public school,
y-yo- you teach from first through, uh, sixth grade. And (pause) whenever the grades, uh,
would have their class, in my room, the homeroom teacher wouldn't even come to my room.
Like, they would just send the kids down and they'd have their lesson. I mean, in general,
you're supposed to be with, like, we were supposed to be like, teaching assistants. Like,
there should be a Korean staff in the room. But in my time at this particular public school,
the Korean teachers aren’t with their students. Now, at my second, at my second public
school, uh, X elementary school, uhm, th-the Korean, uh, teachers would come with their
students, but the school I am working at now in X, uh, they just send them, they just send
the kids along.
Interviewer: So, you teach independently in the classroom?
Luke: Yes, yes, uhm, oh and I think that's not how it should be. I think, uhm, because it's the
countryside, this is the rural area, people are a lot more relaxed when it comes to education
and, you know, the students dealing with the foreigners here. And it's a lot more attractive,
a lot more comfortable. And there's a lot more freedom, you know, a lot more autonomy to
do what I like in a class with the students. Yes.
Interviewer: And what is the classroom dynamic like teaching with your co-teachers? You
mentioned that the co-teacher is not involved at all in the classroom.
Luke: Right. Well, I-I I just pretty much do what I want. I mean, obviously, I follow the, uh,
the government textbooks that they give us for the English program. Uhm, at GEPIK, but
uhm, other than that, I don't have any type of input from the, the Korean teachers. I mean,
they try to ask at the end of the day, hey, like, you know, uhm, you know “What chapters
did you cover in the textbook, like for the (mumbling), you know, for the specific grade?”
And, um, I would tell them, like, up to what pages, what pages I had taught to. Outside of
that, I'm not asked anything else. I'm not asking anything as far as like games or tests, you
know, uh, (chuckle) they're really not that all involved.
Interviewer: And before coming to Korea, were you a qualified teacher?
Luke: Absolutely not (laughing). Absolutely not.
Interviewer: Your first experience?
Luke: Yes, uh, like, uh I didn't even teach English. I was a math teacher; I was a math teacher.
I taught math, you know, back home in the States, you know, and because I couldn't find a
job at home in the States, you know, my best friend at the time, which was a Korean guy,
told me to come to Korea and teach English. So, uh, this is definitely outside of my field. And
yeah, that's, that’s what I'm doing here now.
Interviewer: But you still have a background in teaching, but not necessarily in English.
Luke: Right. Not necessarily English. Right.
Interviewer: So, would you consider yourself to be an English teacher or a teacher assistant?
Luke: I would consider myself an English teacher.
Interviewer: Could you please elaborate on that?
Luke: (Long pause) So, what would you like to know about an English teacher?
Interviewer: Um, why you would consider yourself to be an English teacher and not a
teacher assistant? Even though, uhm, the outline, you're a teacher assistant, but you're
working in the capacity of an English teacher. So, could you tell me why you see yourself as
an English teacher in the classroom?
Luke: Well, I consider myself an English teacher in the classroom because, I'm the only one
giving instructions to the children, in English.
Interviewer: And can you—
Luke: Yes
Interviewer: And can you describe your usual daily routine at work?
Luke: All right, so, uhm, I come in the morning. The first thing I do is I check what chapters,
what chapters or units I'm supposed to cover in the governmental, you know, uh, provided
English, uh, English book. I guess there's a curriculum I’m, I'm supposed to follow within the
semester. And, um, I follow like my outline, it’s-it’s- it’s done, uh, by the month and by-
weekly, like I try, I follow, to see if I'm just on track. So, in the morning I go over what
sections I'm supposed to teach that day with the students. And (pause) I'll teach (pause) the
most I'll teach in the morning. It'll be like four classes. You know, it, it changes every day
because I teach different grades, uh, throughout the week. I'll have lunch and then I'll have
(pause) maybe one or two classes in the afternoon after lunch. And then we have something
called Bang -wahoo. Bang-wahoo in English is, uh, how can I say this? Bang-wahoo
(thinking) maybe kind of like an afternoon program.
Interviewer: Oh, yes.
Luke: Yeah. Afternoon, like, you know, studies and it's unrelated to the, the government
provided English textbooks. I just teach the kids, you know, uhm, I-I- I just, for the most part,
I play with them, you know, it's more like, you know, hands-on. I play games with the kids.
The English instructions are a lot more loose. You know, I have the kids do crossword
puzzles. I-I-It's a time where the kids can be a lot more, uhm, a lot more intimate with the
foreign teacher, you know, without the confines of, you know, following the books or
whatever. And uhm, we even watch YouTube, we watch programs, we even watch movies,
you know, but everything's obviously related to English. So, yeah.
Interviewer: And what do you think about the English afterschool program? Do you consider
it beneficial or how do you view it?
Luke: I think it works for students that are shy in class because in class, like there's, how can
I say? Like, you know, Koreans are very, uh, competitive. There's a very competitive nature
about, you know, the people here. And a lot of students, if they feel they can't do well, like
the others, they tend to take a back seat and they don't like to participate. But, during the
afternoon programs, I mean the kids, that, that were shy during the morning, you know,
governmental, you know, classes, English classes, I mean, they're different people (chuckles),
like they have very different children. You know, they're a lot more outspoken because it's
more fun, you know, kids, they want to have fun. And uhm, I think a lot of that is missing in
the, you know, in the government provided books that I teach in the mornings. So, is it
helpful? Yes. However, not all the students I teach are required to, uh, have lessons with me
in the afternoon. It's totally on a warranted basis, like whether the kids want it or not. So,
yeah.
Interviewer: So, you think that because you have that autonomy in the lesson planning, you
can directly (pause) reach the student? It's student-centered, the teaching?
Luke: Yes, absolutely. And actually, sometimes students will ask, you know, questions
regarding like grammar, grammar, things that they've learned in the morning. And I can go
into a lot more detail with like worksheets, you know, and it's more, uhm, one-on-one, if
you will. You know, cause look, cause what we'll do is we'll have the kids. Okay. It's like, for
example, at 2.30, you know, I'll have students that will come in for Bang-wahoo, and it's all
mixed grades. Like it'll be, uh, third graders and fourth graders.
Interviewer: Yes.
Luke: And then fifth graders and sixth graders, like it's usually two groups. And since the
thirds, third and fourth graders, like they're similar in age, I'll have the ones that just want to
play or have, you know, interactions with me. Or, I'll just have them play a game like, you
know, Monopoly, and they’ll, these kids are quite fluent. They have, not fluent, but they
have a decent command of English. And then the ones that I've, I’ve noticed that are having
some troubles, you know, with, you know, the English that they learn throughout the day or
the weeks, I'll work on, you know, either grammar structures or, you know, some
conversational patterns that they probably didn't get in my class. And I'll work with um-em-
them directly with supplemental, uh, supplemental materials. And it's the same thing with
the fifth and sixth graders.
Interviewer: And when it comes to decision-making regarding the English curriculum, test or
lesson planning, are you actively involved?
Luke: Absolutely. Uhm, at the end of every unit, there's always a test. Uhm, I give, I give, uh,
spelling quizzes throughout the week, uh (pause). And there's like the, uh, like there's
midterm and finals, all of that. Like just like a regular school, like I have to distribute those at
the same time that the Koreans are giving them their, their other, uh, tests, like for whether
it's math, you know, society, sahwei, Korean language, like I have to give them the same, uh,
tests as they would as the other classes.
Interviewer: So, you take on a leadership position in the field of English at your school?
Luke: Yes. That's another way to put it. Absolutely.
Interviewer: And do you think that you have contributed p- positively to the end goal of
enhanced English communication among students in the classroom?
Luke: Absolutely, uh, and I, I see that from the, I see that from c-cause- because what
happened at the end of the year, like before, uhm, like before I tell the school whether I
want to re-sign or not, the, the head teacher of our school—
Interviewer: Yes.
Luke: Principal and vice principal, they all, you know, uh, I all, we all meet together, and
they ask me whether I want to re-sign or not. And uhm, I'm always giving the offer like, you
know, hey, you know, we'd like you to stay because the kids, they really like you. And we
see that they're more importantly, the kids, the English skills are improving, you know? So, I
think by, you know, their offer every year, because now I'm on my fifth year, I think I'm
doing more than, more than my job (chuckles), you know, for the people of X, (inaudible).
Interviewer: You have a positive impact?
Luke: Absolutely.
Interviewer: And how—
Luke: And I'm here to stay, mhm.
Interviewer: And how do you think the subject English is perceived by colleagues and
superiors at your school?
Luke: Did you, can you just ask that one more time?
Interviewer: How do you think the subject English is perceived by colleagues and superiors
at your school?
Luke: In the countryside and rural areas—
Interviewer: Yes.
Luke: For the most part, it's frowned upon because there's not a lot of application of English
in the immediate area. So, uhm as such, the colleagues, they even speak to me in Korean,
you know, because I've been here for so long, but I am discouraged to speak Korean to the
kids. And I'm actually okay with it, you know, because I'm not really here for the adult
approval. I'm here to just disseminate, you know, English instructions for the betterment of
the children and their future.
Interviewer: But, when you say frowned upon, what do you mean by that in the
countryside?
Luke: Almost, uhm, I think, well, if you live in the city, I mean, there are English hagwons,
English academies everywhere. Like there's almost this push for the children to learn English
and to try to speak it outside the classroom. But that same demeanor isn't carried on in the
rural areas. You know, uhm, there's no real push to have the kids study English. And when I
see the kids speaking English to me in the hallways or in the lunchroom, I don't see a lot of
the adults or the Korean staff giving praise like, “Oh your English skills are really good”. “Oh
like...” There’s a huge gap. You know, whereas, you know, in my experience working at the
academy, there was a lot of praise and a lot of, uh, recognition when they saw kids using
English with the foreigners outside of the class. Because, you know, at a hagwon, a foreign
academy, you speak, there are actually many different—
Interviewer: Yes
Luke: Foreigners working there. And then they try to encourage the kids to speak more, not
just in the classroom. But since it's just me, since like I'm the kind of the minority in this, in
this environment, it's almost like English studies is like a backseat, if you will.
Interviewer: O-Okay.
Luke: Yeah
Interviewer: And how do you think students perceive English?
Luke: Well, okay, the kids are, I mean, how do they perceive English? (pause) I really don't
know. I mean, oftentimes the kids, they tell me that English is hard, but that can be said
about any language that's not your mother tongue. Uh, yeah.
Interviewer: And does the way that they perceive English either positively or negatively,
does that affect you emotionally?
Luke: I wouldn't use the terms positive and negative. I just think because they're unaware,
they don't know. I mean, English is, is vastly different. Like the grammar structures, you
know, the written part, everything is vastly different from the Korean language. So, it’s
naturally, it’s going to be hard, uh, for them to learn. And once I've accepted that, like, okay,
because it's very different from what they already know, it's nothing similar to the Korean
world, if that makes sense.
Interviewer: Yes.
Luke: Um, I go in, you know, I-I-I go in, uh, positively in-in-in teach and do my job, you know,
the best way I can. I wouldn't say if it's a positive or negative thing. Um, it is a challenge, you
know, but for the most part, I enjoy teaching. I mean, obviously my time spent here is the
evidence for it. Like I've been here now five and a half years. And, you know, emotionally,
um, sometimes it's, especially like when the year starts—
Interviewer: Yes
Luke: You'll get like the first graders, you know, since it's been five and a half years, I've
always seen a new set of students coming to the school. Uh, teaching first grade was always
like the most challenging. But once they get into the rhythm of, okay, there's, there’s
homework, you know, they get into a system of learning, uhm, grammar structures, you
know, phonics, you know, you know, uhm, spelling, idioms, all like i-i-it, when I start from
the beginning from first grade, I mean, again, it's the toughest part. But from there, because
they're very young, they learn very fast. They learn the rules very fast. And they're in an all-
English environment, like unlike teaching at a private school, where the Korean, where the
Korean staff is in the room with you, and they're speaking Korean to them, translating
everything. It's fully immersive, uh, when I'm teaching them English in my room by myself.
And I actually enjoy it better, because, you know, I can pick on things, pick up on things that
Korean staff don't, you know, so yeah.
Interviewer: So, the feelings of students, the way that they feel towards English, it does not
necessarily affect you emotionally, you are unfazed by it, you just carry on teaching, and you
remain positive.
Luke: Absolutely, uhm. and I think, for me, it has a lot to do with like the autonomy part of it,
because, you know, in my experience, anytime when there's like another senior, like a
Korean elder in, in a room, like whether it's a parent, teacher, in my experience, the kids,
they seem very like inhibited, like they seem like, like they don't want to give their best.
And they're so worried about making mistakes, because they're being watched by like a
Korean senior, or like someone, someone Korean in the class is going to judge them or
speak to them later. But at the public school I'm at now, because there's no Korean teacher
in the class, the kids do, they open up a lot more, like if that makes sense? So yeah.
Interviewer: And when do you feel frustrated at work?
Luke: When I teach, uh, (pause) just the, just the little ones, like when I sometimes I have
the kindergartners come into my class, like they're, because it's next door, and just for, I
don't know, for curiosity reasons, the, the staff would send the, the, the kindergartners into
the, with the first graders, just to kind of observe. And they would sit and watch in the back,
and just for the kids to get, I guess, used to being at least around the foreigner, because I'm
going to see these kids the very next year, you know, uhm, when they become first graders.
And uhm, so what's the most, what's the difficult thing for me? (Pause) Uhm, trying to get
them to write the alphabet (chuckles), because like the English alphabet, because, you know,
I mean, they don't even know Korean alphabet just yet, like if that makes sense? Because
they're, they're kindergartners, and they're first graders, they still don't know, know how to
write their own language, uh, down pat just yet. So I think writing (laughs), that's the
hardest part. Speaking is not, people think like speaking is hard. No, when they're really
young, trying to get them to write the uppercase and lowercase, and lowercase is really
tough. Yeah.
Interviewer: And how do you deal with that frustration at work? Internally, how do you deal
with it?
Luke: I just, I don't have any real method of releasing stress, you know, uhm, I know that it
comes with the territory. So, though it might be stressful, it doesn't bother me, as it did in
the past, like in the past, it was like, uhm, I was blaming myself beca-because the kids
weren't getting it (pause). As soon as I like them, as soon as I like them to, but then I learned
that no, like, these are like brand new English learners, like, you know, just, it's not my fault.
They're still learning how to write Hangul (laughs).
Interviewer: So, I kind of, you know, when I came to that understanding, uhm, it became
more, like more, it became less, uh, more, it wasn't that much of a, of a problem, as I
thought it was in the beginning. (inaudible) Um, yeah
Interviewer: So, you have to give yourself a self-talk?
Luke: Yeah, yeah like my own self-prep, like pep, pep talk, kind of like, hey, like, you know,
it's not that, it's not that bad. Like they're, they're just learning, there's nothing more that I
can do to make their, make this learning transition for them better. Like, i-i-it's this is just
grueling, like, -i-i-it's pulling teeth. But, and even the kids cry sometimes, because it's, I tell
them, like, hey, man, it's not the same. And because, you know, you got to write on the
lines, you know, within the lines. And, you know, like when you write the (pause), you know,
because in Korean, there's no such thing as uppercase, lowercase.
Interviewer: Yes.
Luke: You know, so you're looking at 26 times two (laughs). You know, and, and along with
that, you teach them how to write the numbers too. And, but yeah, it comes with the
territory. And I just, I-I-I get it now.
Interviewer: So, So, you've had to do quite a bit of self-reflection.
Luke: Yeah. You know, uhm, but it's good. Like, you know, just the babies, they, you know,
they'll get it, you know, and just as all of my first graders had done so, you know.
Interviewer: And what would you consider an ideal work environment?
Luke: (Long pause) Hmm, what I would consider an ideal work environment? The place I'm
at now, just to give you the description. Uhm, I like, I like having my own classroom and this
is the reason why. Um, I've taught at other public schools and other public schools, uhm,
whenever I had to teach a class, I had to go to their homeroom. I had to go to where the
students were. And for me, what I've learned, the d-d-disadvantage that I've learned was
that the kids, when you go to their own rooms, they don't change, uh, their learning habits,
because they're in a place of comfortability. And I forgot the expression, but I think it was
like, you know, comfortability, breeds, contempt or something like that. Like whatever. I
forgot how it goes.
Interviewer: Yes
Luke: Go ahead.
Interviewer: Oh, yes, I understand what you're saying. Due to the environment, it's a habit.
They're used to it.
Luke: Yeah. Yeah. And there's no, there's no incentive to, to change their learning patterns
and behaviors in that bit. So, when they, when they, when they come to my room, you
know, they're already, you know, kind of, you know, attuned to, okay, I got to do or learn
something in a different way. And it's better for them, you know, and also for me too, you
know, they're not, they're not sitting next to their best friends and, you know, they're not
distracted as they would be in their own classrooms. So, yeah.
Interviewer: So, it's related to having the autonomy and control of the classroom. Once
they're—
Luke: Yeah.
Interviewer: They’re in the English classroom and they know you're in charge.
Luke: Absolutely like, you know, yeah, you know, there's better classroom management
when they're, when they're on my turf, then I'm going to their turf. Like, if that makes sense
(chuckles).
Interviewer: Yes.
Luke: And then, and also like, when I go to their classroom, like the Korean, their homeroom
teacher is there watching them and just kind of making sure that they don't make mistakes
and they're, they're nervous and they don't want to speak. It's actually more work when I go
to their room. When they come to my room, they're a lot more relaxed. They're a lot more,
uhm, they like to participate more. They ask questions, like they won't ask questions of the
Korean teachers there. They won't, they won't even talk, but you know, when they come
down, yeah, so they answer your question and that would be the ideal working, um, um,
place where the kids come to my classroom. And because i-i-it's going to be, they have to
follow my rules, you know, my curriculum, my, my way of teaching, et cetera, et cetera.
Interviewer: And since you don't have a Korean co-teacher in the classroom, how do you
convey meaning to the students?
Luke: Well, I, well, I speak Korean, so I write the, the translations on the board in Korean for
them. Um, In, on the, uh, on the government kind of, within the government textbook,
there is Korean instructions. Like there is translation, like you have like on the side notes,
there, there is translations, so it's not that hard to convey meaning.
Interviewer: Okay.
Luke: Yeah.
Interviewer: So, you do not struggle with, um, conversion with the students?
Luke: Not at all, because on the web, like, okay, so when I, when you teach the book, you
got to use the website that's connected with the book and the website is the Korean
website. So, you know, all the worksheets, the audio, like it's all given with Korean
instructions. And then like the dialogue or whatever, the material we're covering, like only
that is in English, but like the instructions and how to write in how many times or, you know,
rules, all of that is explained in Korean. There's like, there's very little translation that I need
to do myself because it's all provided on the webpage, well the webpage I teach with the
book.
Interviewer: So, the provided translation sort of replaces the Korean co-teacher then, in the
classroom? There's no need for them?
Luke: You said it.
Interviewer: And what would you consider a good day at work?
Luke: Every Friday (laughs). Because I teach the, the least amount of classes and then I go
home, I can go home early (laughs).
Interviewer: And then what would you consider a bad day at work?
Luke: Mondays (laughs). Mondays, because, you know, you get back from, you know, a fun-
filled weekend it’s like Mondays, like you're kind of tired from the weekend. And it's just the
abrupt, like the abruptness of Sunday. Okay, bang, next day back to work. I don't know. I
mean, I guess, I don't know if I'm answering the question, but yeah, Fridays are the best
days and Mondays are like, oh, it's back to the plantations type of thing (laughs).
Interviewer: So, when you're having a bad day at work, then how does it impact your
teaching capabilities or classroom environment?
Luke: Um, I- I become a little bit less enthused about, especially if it's a topic that I'm not
really interested in teaching, you know, um, like I don't like teaching, um, the um, the games
in the, in the government textbooks because they're not fun at all. I mean, I'm just, I’m just
gonna keeping it above, it's h-h-honest. The games are not fun. I just skip ‘em. I do, I like to
do Volscreen. Volscreen is really, it's a lot more interactive because now everything is like,
they're looking at some type of screen and there's an input, you know, with your fingers and
the kids, they, they tend to get more into that more than the, the actual games where they
got to make ‘em speak, um, that are from the books. I hate it.
Interviewer: Oh, what is Volscreen?
Luke: Volscreen is a, is a website, uh, where you use videos, like it's clips from like movies
and TV shows. And it's like, they'll usually play the clip of like 10 to 25 seconds.
Interviewer: Yes.
Luke: And then at the end, at the end of it, uh, of the, of the playing the video, the kids that
will have the option of either choosing left or right, and the left portion and the right
portion, they'll have two different translations and the kids, they got to choose the correct
one within like 20 seconds.
Interviewer: And does this relate then to the teaching material?
Luke: Uh, it's my supplemental material. It's not provided by the school. It's something I
found online.
Interviewer: Oh.
Luke: Yeah, I highly recommend this. The kids love it. The kids love it, man. I can, you can do
that for like 20 minutes, you like, it's a, it’s a great, not only time killer, but, uh, the kids can
see English in, in the real world, not just by the damn textbook, excuse my language
(chuckles), not just by the, you know, the boring textbook, like they can see real English in,
in you know, in usage.
Interviewer: And when you are having a good day at work, how does it impact your teaching
capabilities or classroom environments?
Luke: A lot more enthused. I actually get to the lesson faster. And it's more of a reason to
use Volscreen (chuckles) because the kids, they're like, “Teacher, Volscreen!” (laughs) I'm
like (chuckles) do not use Volscreen.
Interviewer: Do you think that the students can pick up on your, um, personality for the
day? When you're having a good day or a bad day?
Luke: (Long pause) Uh, yes, they can cause, I mean, they see me every day. I mean, I'm the-
that (stuttering), I'm probably, they're probably around us, like the teachers, more than
they’re around their own parents. Like, it means, they spend, they spend most of their day
with us (laughs). Like, so I think the kids can know their teachers a lot more easy, a lot more
easier than, than probably their own parents at home.
Interviewer: So, when you are having a bad day at work, do you notice a change in their
demeanor?
Luke: Uh, yeah, you know, uhm, they, they tend to act up less, you know, when they, when
they see that I’m not in a good mood. Uhm (pause).
Interviewer: And on a good day at work?
Luke: Good day at work. Again, like, you know, uh, I give, give out more Volscreen
opportunities for the kids because that's what they like to see. I do more Hangman, you
know, uh, probably one of the easiest game, easiest game to play. But, you know, it's, it’s
still a lot of fun, even to this, to this day, Hangman. With the younger students, with the,
with the younger students anyway, you wouldn't do it with the older students.
Interviewer: And what have you had to adopt or change about yourself to conform to
Korean standards or expectations in the classroom?
Luke: (Long pause) What have I had to adopt or change to meet the Korean standards in the
classroom long pause). Uh, nothing. I mean, I just, I just follow the textbooks (laughs). I just,
I mean, like I follow the program that they've given me. They, at the beginning of the school
year, they say, hey, these are the books, third, fourth, fifth, sixth.
Interviewer: So, you are authentically yourself?
Luke: Yeah. You know, because you don't teach, you don't teach, uh, first and second grade.
We teach third, fourth, fifth, and sixth, and sixth grade. And I'm given the books and I'm told
in advance, “Okay, these are the, these are the chapters you got to cover. Here are the
quizzes. These are the tests you got to give out.” And I follow just that. I mean, uh, yeah
(pause).
Interviewer: So, you haven't had to change your teaching style compared to your, um, in, I
think in America, when you were a math teacher, have you had to change your teaching
style to conform to Korean schools?
Luke: Well, I was a math tutor, so I wasn't really teaching, you know, in a classroom setting.
So, it was a lot different. But, um, yeah, I didn't have to change any teaching styles at all. I
just, actually, my style just developed on its own as I, as I began to teach here more.
Interviewer: So, do you think you've grown more through the years in terms of teaching and
your style and adapting and changing?
Luke: Absolutely. Yes.
Interviewer: And when do you suppress unpleasant feelings?
Luke: I don't. If I'm upset, like I wear my, my emotions on my sleeves. I don't, I don't do well
with the poker face. If I'm upset, I kind of let people know, like, “Hey man, stay back. I'm not
feeling well today.” Especially if I have like a headache or something, you know, just, I kind
of let people know, you know, up front so that there are no like surprises. You know, I'm not,
you know, I mean, I think it's good to have a poker face with the little ones, with the
younger groups, but with the older kids, you can kind of say, you kind of say, “Hey guys, I'm
not feeling too well today, man. Like make sure you guys follow my instructions. I don't
want to; I don't want to repeat myself guys.” And they kind of, you know, they kind of get it
like fifth and sixth graders. They, they get it. But with the third and fourth graders, you got
to do more of the poker face with them. Cause they're not going to get, they're not going to
understand like, “Oh, teacher you’re having a bad day?” They're not going to get around or
understand that.
Interviewer: So, what is the poker face exactly?
Luke: You gotta, you gotta keep a smile on your face. You know, um, when you're feeling,
even when you feel like crap, you know, just, you know, especially with the younger they
are, the stronger your poker face gotta be. And then the older the students are, the more
you can be more relaxed, and you can be more of yourself, you know.
Interviewer: So, the poker face is related to the behavior of the students? Not necessarily
um, the behavioral rules of the school or teachers, for example, you should do this, you
shouldn't do that.
Luke: Well, I-I- I think it's just a technique that I employ so that, um, like, so that I can save
face. I don't, you know, look stupid or I don't look like I'm behaving differently than when
I'm supposed to. I mean, I'm a human too. Like I have emotions and, you know, my feelings
get hurt and I can't always pretend, um, like, you know, my feelings aren't, you know,
because some students, like they might get out of hand, they might, or some students, they
might, you know, they might, you know, might make, say a curse word or (coughs), excuse
me. I mean, they're all not angels, you know, per se. You know, I mean, there are times
when kids get, when they get, um, become disruptive, you know, because they might came
back from like, what I don't like sometimes when they come back from PE, for example—
Interviewer: Yes.
Luke: The kids are very, they're very, they're very animated. And then, um, they have a hard
time settling down in my class. If they have PE right before my class (pause), um, a lot of
times the distractions, you know, or it's kind of hard to settle them down, um, at that time.
And the poker face becomes a lot harder to maintain. I just, I just break character, “Hey,
man, settle down guys.” You know, like (chuckles), you know, if that makes sense.
Interviewer: So, um the next question is, how do you react to unpleasant feelings? So, from
your description, then, you have sort of like a threshold of how much you can maintain, and
then you just release your feelings?
Luke: Um.
Interviewer: Correct?
Luke: Would you rephrase that? I mean, like, you want a scenario or just? Well, okay. Okay,
just go ahead.
Interviewer: How do you react to unpleasant feelings? So, you said you have a poker face,
and then you reach a certain threshold, where you will just say, “Sorry, guys, please be
quiet.” So, is that a reaction, then to this unpleasant feeling?
Luke: Well, when the kids are talking over me, you know, when I, when I have to, when I
have to say more than three times, you know, what I like, well, I employ different
techniques before the, before the poker face starts to, uh, wean away. What I like to do is I
like to hold my hand up, like I stop, I stop myself in the midst of my own speech. When I see
the kids aren't paying attention, I put my hand up and I, I don't count down with my voice, I
just show my hand, my hand is in the air and I hold down each finger, like I'll have five
fingers up. And I'll pull down my pinky, ring finger, middle, index, and then thumb. And if my
thumb is, is you know, is my, if I have a, if I have a fist clenched, by that time, usually the
students, they quiet down, they settle down.
Interviewer: So, would—
Luke: And then—
Interviewer: So would you—
Luke: Sorry, go ahead.
Interviewer: So, would you say then the countdown, it's sort of like a pep talk as well, for
yourself to remain calm?
Luke: Yeah, yeah, it also, you know, recalibrates me. Cause like I'm getting, I'm getting like
animated myself because they're not listening to me, you know, and it's usually, it usually
happens right after, uh, they have the PE lesson and then they come in my room, sweaty,
you know, animated, excited. Um, yeah. I tried to have the school rearrange the schedule
like that, but they said it can't be helped. The schedule is already set like, like for an already
in a year in advance. So, um...
Interviewer: And how do you mitigate unpleasant feelings?
Luke: Well, that's all I do. I mean, I mean every, I mean, obviously every situation is
different, you know, um, if it's an individual, I would, uh, pull them out at the end of class,
you know, like if someone, you know, said a curse word or they were, got into a fight with
one of the other students or, you know, et cetera, using, like using the phones in class, you
know, um, I mean, obviously every case is different, you know. Um, and I just, I just handled
them as they come.
Interviewer: And what is the impact of suppressing these unpleasant feelings at work, for
yourself personally?
Luke: I think, I think you use that word a lot, like suppress (laughs), like I'm not, I'm not, I
don't really like suppress anything. I-I remember I said, like, if I'm upset, I just kind of show it
like, you know, just kind of wear my emotions on my shoulders. I don't really suppress
anything. Let me think, I don't think that's good at all. You know, I mean, the most I'll do is a
poker face—
Interviewer: Yes.
Luke: And then, and as I mentioned earlier, you know, the younger the groups are, the
younger the age, the more I, I guess, try to, you know, restrain myself—
Interviewer: Yes.
Luke: Because you got to have more patience with the younger ones. You know, they have
no choice. They're little humans learning, you know, they're still learning like, you know,
human behaviors, et cetera. But with the older ones, you know, I can let, I can let loose a
little bit. If that makes sense. I can, um, I can, you know, buckle, you know, tighten my belt
and, you know, and I can buckle down, you know, there's more carrot and stick. You can do
more carrot and stick more with the older groups, like fifth and sixth graders, you know.
Interviewer: Because, um, my study is about, also it's called emotional labor. That's why I'm
asking you these questions.
Luke: Oh (laughing).
Interviewer: Because, um, emotional labor is when you do not show your genuine emotions,
you mask it behind a different emotion. So, when you mentioned poker face, your genuine
emotion could be, for example, you're upset, you're frustrated, but the poker face, you try
and remain calm and pleasant. So that is sort of an emotional labor taking place.
Luke: Understand.
Interviewer: So, when I'm saying, when you're suppressing these unpleasant feelings, some
people could have a headache, for example, or physical reaction, like clenching their fists, or
as you said, the countdown with your hands.
Luke: Oh yeah. Well, that's just the, uh, that's just part of classroom management. Um, I
wouldn't say that's necessarily for me, like suppression of emotions, like, you know, just, um,
that's just my way of just, you know, getting the attention of the students.
Interviewer: Hmm, okay.
Luke: But, um, but my emotions, I mean, obviously they're all, they're in check. I mean, I've
never had an outburst, you know, in class because of being overwhelmed or stressed out.
Like, I mean, it's not a stressful job at all. You know, um, my student body, each class is like,
there's no more than 10 students per class, you know, I mean, compared to public schools
in the city.
Interviewer: Yes.
Luke: In the city, you know, every class is like minimum 25, you know, just, and I mean, you
damn, you damn, you don't even know all of the names, but I just go work out now. I know
all of the names, you know, so there's a, there's more of an intimate, you know,
environment and, and, and because the classroom sizes are smaller, classroom
management is better. I'm not as easily, you know, you know, agitated if that makes sense
or irritated. So yeah.
Interviewer: So, do you feel like because you have a smaller classroom in the rural areas,
you can be a bit more authentically yourself? You don't need to put on a mask or anything
like that. You can be yourself because the classes are smaller. You're more intimate with
students.
Luke: 100%, yes.
Interviewer: So, my next question is, do you see yourself as resilient towards emotion or
vulnerable?
Luke: Because of my environment, more resilient.
Interviewer: Towards emotion, are you resilient or vulnerable? Like emotion just takes over
you or you're more resilient towards it?
Luke: Oh, well, I'm more resilient to, to the changes of my emotions, you know, um, and I, I-
I- I try not to let my emotions get the best of me, especially like in front of the kids, because
you don't want to, you know, the kids are a lot more sensitive than we are. And, you know,
um, I just do my best not to let the kids see me get upset or, or overwhelmed like that.
Interviewer: So, what cultural differences have impacted your wellbeing in the workplace? I
know you mentioned that you're authentically yourself, but is there anything maybe in
terms of communication with a co-teacher or management or something like that?
Luke: Um, well (pause) it doesn't have anything to do with the teaching. It's usually when we
have a Hwesik. I don't know. Do you know what that is?
Interviewer: Uh, yes, the dinner.
Luke: Right. So, when we have Hwesik, I'm not as really comfortable having Hwesik because,
because I'm more isolated in the role. Uh, elementary school, I don't really work with the
other teachers closely. I don't really know them. So, it always feels like awkward when
they're sitting next to me and then (pause) they try to make me drink. I'm a Muslim, so I
don't drink. And it's even more awkward because, you know, Korean, you know, Korean
society is the drinking culture.
Interviewer: Yes.
Luke: And, you know, if you don't drink with them, they almost take it, take it as like
offensive that you're not trying to, you know, be like us, like when in Rome do as Romans do.
Like, I'm not, I don't really participate in that. So, that can be more stressful than like the
teaching part, because then I got a, I always got a decline. And the principle, he told
everyone that I'm a Muslim, and that I don't drink. And even though the teachers, they've
accepted it, like I can tell they're not happy about it. Like, you understand what I'm saying?
Because I can't enjoy, you know, drinking with them.
Interviewer: Hmm. So, do you think that you're treated fairly at work? If not, how does it
influence your teaching and behavior at work?
Luke: I don't know if I'm being treated fairly at work or not, because I have very little
interactions with the people at work. I-I I have more interactions with the students than I
have the staff. So, I don't, I don't even know if I can answer that. I mean, I'm just, I deal with
the students and then I go home, really.
Interviewer: And...
Luke: (interrupts) I don't, I don't even, I don't even have to like submit like a lesson plan to
the, to the, to the, uh staff. That's how (chuckles), uh, that's how distant I am from the, uhm,
the people in the, in the admin, in the admin office. Like they really, you know, they give me
the books and I see them when I see them. Like, I'm never really called into the office for a
meeting, you know. All the meetings are usually held without me, you know. Uhm, really,
I'm just like, I am my own apartment. I mean, I am my own department.
Interviewer: Yes.
Luke: (laughs) uh, I'm my own boss type of thing, you know. I mean, I get, when I get, when
it's time to give the midterms and finals, I get the tests and I give the results to my head
teacher. That's it. Nothing really else is really expected of me.
Interviewer: And does this distance affect you, emotionally?
Luke: I feel a lot more lonely, you know. And because of that, uhm, (pause) I felt like
Koreans didn't like foreigners, but then I, but after some time working here, I realized, no,
that's just the environment. It has nothing to do with liking or disliking foreigners. I mean,
just, they're not required to deal with me on a daily basis. And (pause) the most I'll see them
is just in the hallway, Anneyonghaseyo and that's it. We keep pushing, you know, we keep
moving (chuckles). And I'll teach the kids. Because in early on, in my earlier years here, I had
this, you know, preconceived notion like, oh man, they don't like foreigners, etc. They I’m
like, well, namely, they don't like English teachers because, you know, they don't use English
here, you know, outside. And I was like, no, uhm, they're not really required to deal with us,
you know. And I'm just another foreigner just passing through, you know, because they
generally hire a new foreigner every year, you know. A lot of foreigners don't stay, so
they're kind of used to us just kind of coming and going, and they don't really put a lot more,
a lot of effort in trying to maintain some type of relationship with us because they know
that we're leaving at some point.
Interviewer: So, they think that you're just going to pass by, you know, it's a high turnover?
Luke: Absolutely.
Interviewer: And you mentioned loneliness. So, due to this loneliness with co-teachers and
staff, do you think that's why you have such a close relationship, then with your students?
Because you do not have that with your colleagues.
Luke: Absolutely.
Interviewer: So, could that be then something that maybe you're missing? This loneliness is
causing you, not causing you, but it's sort of a result, resulting in trying to make your classes
more fun, interactive, communication-based?
Luke: Yeah, well, I channel that, well I channel that energy into just becoming more
productive, you know, because I'm here to work. I'm not really here to socialize with the
Korean staff here. I mean, they go home just like I do. And uhm, I let it not bother me. It
doesn't bother me anymore now, you know, uhm, yeah.
Interviewer: The Korean staff at your school, can they speak English or are they hesitant to
speak English?
Luke: Both. They can speak English and they're hesitant to speak English.
Interviewer: So, do you think there's a shyness when it comes to speaking English?
Luke: Yes. I think in my time here, uh, though there's this huge demand of English education,
the flip side is that there's still a huge case of like a foreigner rejection. They call it kobugam,
waegukin kobugam.
Interviewer: Yes.
Luke: Yeah, this is still a big problem here, uhm, they want English education. They want
their students and children and even adults, they want to know English, but the component
that they miss is that English requires having foreign people, you know, just because of
native speakers, like they're going to be here. And that's just the best experience to have in
English experiences with foreigners or with native speakers. And due to a lot of interactions,
interactions that Koreans have had in history, you know, foreigners, they've been mostly
bad. I mean, this is like a, this is a peninsula, you know, they've always been attacked and
invaded by, you know, outsiders, you know, Japan, Chinese, like on all sides. And so, I think
as a result of that history, you know, I'm not pardoning their behavior, but I'm just, I'm
saying that I understand it, that they still maintain this high level of, uhm, rejection when it
comes to dealing with foreigners and speaking English, you know. Uhm, speaking English is,
it's a backseat, a priority here is speaking Korean. Like, yeah, there's a, like I've got into a
little bit of the mindset of Koreans here. Like when, when they say Korean, they, they call it
Hangug-eo, but Koreans don't use that expression. They say uri-mal. And do you speak
Korean?
Interviewer: A little bit, but what does uri-mal mean?
Luke: Okay. So, uri-mal is another way of saying Korean, like Hangug-eo. And when I hear
Koreans say uri-mal, it's more personal, meaning that this is a language that is specific to us
and is not welcome to others to learn, speak, share.
Interviewer: It's our language?
Luke: Right. You know, uhm, English doesn't translate to the English comes from England,
like the land in which it came from, not necessarily an ownership from people, if that makes
sense. Uhm.
Interviewer: English is more of a universal language?
Luke: Right. And it is, you know, uhm, Koreans don't look at the Korean language as a
universal thing. It's, it's a Korean specific thing. And they want it to stay, they want it to,
they want it to stay that way. They, they feel that Korean, speaking, speaking Korean is
more of a priority than any other language, even though Korean, English is more important
and more the universal language, you know, of the global community. I still feel it's not
accepted that way amongst Korean people.
Interviewer: So, you feel that the identity of Koreans, there are tensions between their
identity and also learning English?
Luke: Yes, there's a huge divide.
Interviewer: And my final question is, do you consider yourself to be part of a team with
staff? If not, do you make any attempts to fit in with colleagues? I know you mentioned that
you feel loneliness and you're sort of segregated, but do you make any attempts to try and
form a professional relationship?
Luke: I don't.
Interviewer: So, you, do you think that there's maybe an invisible line?
Luke: Yeah, uhm, they know that I'm not out here to stay. So yeah, I don't, I don't look at
English teaching that the public sector to be a place where you're going to be welcomed or
kept for, for years on end. At a private school, yes. At a private school, they, because there's
an interest for the owners, you know, uhm it's a business, but that doesn't exist at the
public-school sector, at the public-school sector, that doesn't exist at all.
Participant 3: Jay
Interviewer: Okay, thank you for participating in the interview. You can withdraw consent at
any time, or you can skip to the next question. So, could you briefly tell me where you are
from and for how long you have been teaching at your current school?
Jay: Uh, I am from Cape Town; South Africa and I have been teaching at my current school,
uh, for I would say this is the fourth year.
Interviewer: And do you work at a public rural elementary school?
Jay: Yes, I work at two schools actually, but, uh, my main school is now my travel school, and
my travel school became my main school. So, technically I've been at the same school for
five years but my travel school that is now my main school, I've been there four years.
Interviewer: Oh, and they're both elementary schools?
Jay: Yes, both elementary, both rural I would say.
Interviewer: And how do you find working at more than one school?
Jay: Uhm, I think it's okay, it's not (pause) stressful I would say. I actually enjoy it because it’s,
it kind of gives me a break from either school. So, I think I- I rather enjoy two schools.
Interviewer: And have you had any teaching experience prior to teaching at your current
school?
Jay: Uhm, before I came to South Korea I had no, like formal teaching experience. I did
online English tutoring but that was as far as my teaching experience went.
Interviewer: So, you are an unqualified teacher?
Jay: Yes.
Interviewer: And are you looking to progress or in the future become qualified or study
towards teaching?
Jay: I have been considering doing, uhm, doing my postgraduate certificate in education but
if that happens it would most likely happen next year or within the year like two years
following this year.
Interviewer: And why were you interested in applying to teach in a public school in South
Korea?
Jay: Well, uhm, when I started learning or getting to know a bit about South Korea and you
know what everything that goes on here like the culture and things, I really wanted to come
here. And uhm, then I found out via YouTube that you could teach English and you needed a
degree and that was it. So, I like kind of, uh, kind of struggled to find information at first but
luckily, uhm, at my uni I came across a teaching in Korea, uhm, recruitment agency and—
Interviewer: Yes.
Jay: Yeah, they worked for EPIK, uhm, Gold Key Education. And we went to an info session,
my sister and I, and that's how I basically discovered you know like teaching in Korea. I had
no idea that I could apply to teach at a private school (chuckles).
Interviewer: Oh, so you were only aware about a public school?
Jay: Yeah, that was basically the only info I had. It was just like teach English in Korea, oh it's
public school. I had no idea about anything else, honestly.
Interviewer: And it's the culture of South Korea that like spurred your interest?
Jay: Yeah, like, uhm, my sister started listening to K-pop in 2016 (laughs) and I slowly also
started listening to it and the more I listened to K-pop, you know, you end up watching
music videos and they have all this online content. So, I was quite interested and, and you
know, intrigued by the way people, I don't know, portrayed themselves on these videos and
things and also K-dramas and things. And I was like, I just want to see what it's like.
Interviewer: And so, um through public schooling it was sort of your gateway to South
Korea?
Jay: Yeah, basically. I wanted to experience, you know, living here, experience the country
and you know, just, uhm, yeah like being here working here living here.
Interviewer: And what is your relationship like with your co-teacher?
Jay: With my co-teachers, I would say my relationship is all quite neutral and positive. Uhm,
I don't bother them for anything really, unless I really need to, so I think they do appreciate
that. I'm very much just, keep to myself, I'm not hard to to, to keep happy and I think
because I don't demand much from them, they, they, they like that (laughs). So, I think it's
fine.
Interviewer: So, do you have multiple co-teachers? For example, a homeroom teacher is
your co-teacher, or do you have one main co-teacher and then you just work with the
homeroom teacher?
Jay: No, I have multiple, uhm, so with all the, the homeroom teachers I have, to, to teach
with, because there aren't any like, uhm, assigned English Korean teachers. So, yeah, I teach
with, with all of them or just on my own also.
Interviewer: And do you find it difficult having to navigate between different co-teachers
instead of one co-teacher?
Jay: Uhm, it's a bit tricky because, you know, each teacher has their own style of teaching
and, uhm, you know, things don't always go the way you would want it to. But I think I've
adapted well, because at one school, uhm, I teach with the homeroom teachers and at my
other school I teach on my own. So, I've kind of become used to that dynamic, like, I adapt
to each teacher's style, so, I don't think it's too weird, but it could be better.
Interviewer: In what way could it be better? Could you please elaborate on that?
Jay: Uh, yeah of course, uhm, it could be better in a sense, uhm, you know like building a
certain routine with, with all the grades or all the students. Uhm, I think that would make it
easier, uhm, for myself mainly (chuckles) and also the, the teachers that I teach with, so
because each teacher teaches differently. So, either I would help a lot or not help much at
all, so it's just like one standard it would be fine.
Interviewer: So, your role in the classroom isn't a fixed position? You’re sort of having to
adapt to different roles depending on the co-teacher
Jay: Kind of, yes, like with, uhm, with the homeroom teachers that I teach with at, uhm, my
now travel school, uh, my I would say (pause) in two of the grades; fourth grade and fifth
grade, I, I lead the class. I take control and I basically teach them and the, the homeroom
teacher is just there to translate if need be. Uhm, with third grade and sixth grade the
Korean teacher, they take control of the class, and they lead the class. And you know, I'm
there to help, with pronunciation or stuff like that and spelling, So, that's basically the two
extremes of the teaching that goes on (chuckles).
Interviewer: So, the one position you are in charge of, uhm, conducting the lesson and the
co-teacher/homeroom, they would assist you with translating and perhaps classroom
control as well?
Jay: Yes, yes.
Interviewer: And the other position you're placed sort of like a parrot, where you just listen
and repeat and assist students?
Jay: Basically, yeah, basically (laughs) it's yeah two extremes.
Interviewer: And would you consider yourself to be an English teacher or a teacher
assistant?
Jay: I would consider myself a teacher's assistant, like with a little bit of teaching English. I
feel like (pause) if I spoke Korean per say, like if I spoke the language, I feel like I could teach
them more. I could teach them better in, I would say, they would, I feel like I could actually
teach them the language, you know. Like they would be able to, to speak to me and engage
with me and I could explain things in depth from a native speaker's point of view.
Interviewer: And how do you convey meaning in the classroom?
Jay: Uhm, I usually use you know, visual cues like PPTs and pictures and videos and I also try
to act out some things that I say, and with the little bit of Korean that I know I try to, uhm,
relate like certain words to the Korean equivalent, uhm, or stuff like that. And yeah, if I
introduce like a new big word I try to explain it with simpler English words with examples. So,
usually I use examples for my students.
Interviewer: And what would your co-teacher be doing through this process? Would your
co-teacher be present or...?
Jay: So, with the most teaching that I do is, when I'm on my own at my now main school. I
always teach those students on my own and that would be when I, I, you know I use all
these techniques. At my travel school, uhm, with the, the homeroom teachers if there's
something that needs to be explained in depth, I would usually lean on them for translation
because, uh, all of them can, can basically speak and understand English. So, they would
translate you know, in depth, in Korean with examples and they would ask me as well to, to
clarify just to make sure if they’re explaining correctly or stuff like that.
Interviewer: So, you do not use any direct translation in your teaching material?
Jay: I do, uh, at my main school where I teach alone because I don't have a co-teacher to
assist me. So, I use, uh, you know PowerPoints and, uhm, I try not to use too much Korean
but with questions, when you know, when I want to do comprehension questions, I have to
put the English question and the Korean translation. So, that they can understand what the
question is, but yeah.
Interviewer: Do you consider, uhm, the language barrier the biggest hurdle in teaching?
Jay: Uh, I (pause) think so, yes, I think so, because (pause) even if I didn't use, uh, even if I
wait, how can I say this? If I could speak Korean, like you know, like conversationally I think
the kids they, they feel uh, uh, like, they can speak to you and ask you questions more
comfortably. Even if I didn't use Korean in the lesson much, I would be able to answer
questions that they can't say in English, that they can't, you know, translate into English. So,
I feel like yes.
Interviewer: So more of, they would be more confident in asking you a question, if they
could convey it in Korean?
Jay: Yes, I feel, I feel like that, yeah that would be a big help, because it's, I'm on my own, I
can't speak proper Korean and if a student has a question; they low level English and the
question would help them, you know, maybe understand something further or solidify an
idea. I can't explain (chuckles) so it kind of makes me feel bad.
Interviewer: And then how do they try to convey what they're trying to say to you? What
means do they use?
Jay: With my, with my kids (chuckles) oh with my kids, my students at, uh, my main school
now where I teach alone they use, they do their best to use what English words they know
and sometimes they mix in Korean words when they can't, you know, come up with an
English word. Even though, they don't use proper, you know grammar they still try their
best to use English words to, to tell me something, to tell me stories and usually I-I-I
encourage them, like I, how can I say? When they try to tell me something and they can't
get the words, I suggest words and then they'll say ah yes or no, and that's how I try to
encourage them, and I would give them the correct words to say or repeat what they said in
the correct way. So yeah.
Interviewer: And can you describe your usual daily routine at work?
Jay: Uh, my usual, uh, I don't know, each day is kind of different because you know each day
has its own timetable. So, from Mondays to Wednesdays I teach at my main school and
usually, I see my first graders and sixth graders thrice a week and the third and fourth twice
a week and then I'm at my travel school two days, but I also have after-school classes at
both schools, so yeah.
Interviewer: And how many lessons do you teach per day?
Jay: Per day at most, it would be four formal class (pause) lessons or four formal class
periods, and then twice a week after-school. So, at most teaching hours would maybe be six
hours at most.
Interviewer: And what do you usually do in your free time at work, when you do not have
lessons?
Jay: Usually, I would plan for the next classes, like because I use PPTs at one school mostly.
So, I would, uhm, sit and prepare the PPTs for the following lessons and if I need to print
things, I will do that. And make sure I have games and all those things, like backup and I
usually try to have a few days in advance, just in case things happen. So, that's what I
usually do.
Interviewer: And do you feel like you learned how to teach step by step from, uh,
experience? It was sort of like trial and error, like a learning curve and that's how you
learned how to teach?
Jay: Oh yes, definitely, definitely (laughs). When I first got here, I had no idea what to expect,
I had no idea what I was doing and people weren't really helpful, like you know, people that
you ask or meet they don't actually tell you what they do and it was very intimidating when I
got here, because I had no idea what I was doing or what I had to do. But I think, after the
first few months or so, uhm, I slowly, you know, got used to, got used to it and now I kind of
have a rhythm. So, I think, yeah trial and error, definitely.
Interviewer: So, you were thrown into the deep end?
Jay: Yes definitely (laughs).
Interviewer: And you didn't have a Korean, maybe supervisor or co-teacher explain to you
the dynamics of the classroom?
Jay: Hmm, I had, uh, in the beginning, you kno-, at each or at my main school they usually
assign a teacher to be like your, your handler or I don't know what they call it, like you said a
supervisor. But uhm, yeah briefly, they explained to me, you know, what it was supposed to
be like. But I think, most of the schools also are not sure what it's supposed to be like with
an, with a native English speaker, you know, assistant they don't really know. So, I think I
also had to tell the teachers at my, in my first year it's supposed to be co-teaching; because
they also had no idea.
Interviewer: So, you feel like there wasn't a proper guideline implemented to assist in how
exactly to handle the native speaker?
Jay: I think so, uhm, I think they are told like briefly what it, what it should be like but
because homeroom teachers always teach on their own, so having an assistant teacher
thrown in to teach the language, they kind of, I think some of them are okay with it but
some of them are very, you know, awkward because they don't know how to go about it
how to navigate it so, yeah. I think the guidelines could be more, I don't know, detailed or
people could get more training. It's like there's, there’s this lack of communication really
between EPIK and the schools and the teachers, I don't know, but that's what it usually feels
like.
Interviewer: Maybe like a gray area between you and your co-teachers, you're not really
sure how to navigate?
Jay: Yes, definitely. EPIK will tell you one thing, but then the way that the school and the
and, you know, whatever works, works.
Interviewer: And when it comes to decision making regarding the English curriculum tests or
lesson planning are you actively involved?
Jay: Uhm, no (laughs) No, I am not. Uhm, I'm never involved in any meetings regarding, uh,
you know formal things like that. I think mainly because I don't speak Korean and, uh,
because I don't know (pause) I don't know they don't put that much responsibility on me.
They don't give me that much responsibility, so yeah, no.
Interviewer: And do you think that you have contributed positively to the end goal of
enhanced English communication amongst students in the classroom, if yes how so?
Jay: Uhm, I think so to an extent. I think with, with the students, with I would say some
students they enjoy learning English words and phrases that they can easily remember and
use. Uhm, I do acknowledge that it's hard for them to, to learn English properly; the way it's
being taught currently. But I do think that when they learn certain phrases that they can
remember easily and it's fun to use, they use it on each other. So, I do enjoy teaching them
new words and you know fun phrases and things, and I have seen them use it with each
other in class or try to talk to each other in English or address each other, so, I do think so.
Interviewer: And when you say, “Learn English properly” what do you mean by that?
Jay: Uhm, I think the way that, uh, usually they say you know the best way to learn a
language is through immersion, so I think, because Korean students aren't really immersed
in English. The only time that they would maybe hear English is on the internet, and in the
classroom and, along with all the English that they hear in the classroom; there's always a
lot of Korean as well. So, that they can understand the English that they're learning. So, it's
like, it just, it doesn't stick because it's not repetitive enough, it's not how can I say? Drilled
enough and it's not applied enough, they just learn basic, you know, phrases that, if they
read somewhere they would understand but if they had to produce the sentence, they
wouldn't be able to.
Interviewer: So, they're not really becoming independent thinkers because it gets
automatically translated to Korean?
Jay: Yes, that's what I think. Like, I've, I’ve realized that they learn, uh, more I would say, not
easily but some things stick better than others. When they learn it through song or through,
you know, fun videos with examples and things like that.
Interviewer: And how do you think the subject English is perceived by colleagues and
superiors at your school?
Jay: Uhm, I think that, uh, (pause) superiors and colleagues, I think they realize the
importance of the language and you know like, how important it is for the students to learn
because in Korea you like, you know, you do you get tested on it; in order to go to university
and things. So, it is probably like an important subject, and I think most Korean adults would
love to be able to speak English properly, but I think they're also a bit shy or scared when
engaging with an actual English speaker, because they don't want to sound (pause) I don't
know like—
Interviewer: Like a non-native?
Jay: Yeah, like they don't know what they're saying or they, they don't pronounce things
properly. So, I think it's also like a confidence issue; they want to but they're also a bit shy, I
think. And I can understand it's not easy to learn English or even Korean.
Interviewer: And uhm, these are colleagues and superiors, you feel they are a bit shy to
speak English with you?
Jay: Uhm, some of them do speak English with me and if they, they can't get to a word they
try their best. So, I think, uhm, at my travel school, uhm, my principal speaks English fairly
well, so he usually has you know short conversations with me, because he wants to learn
new words and things and, I appreciate that. And most of the teachers, actually quite a few
of them, speak, you know, conversational English and they will say things to me in English
and things like that or we'll share joke and things, but in my other school, it's completely the
opposite (laughs).
Interviewer: And how do you notice their anxiousness? Do they give you like signals through
facial expression or tone of voice? How do you know that they're feeling anxious or maybe
have anxiety?
Jay: Uh, (laughs) oh okay, uhm, I think it could be like, in the approach, you know, they kind
of look hesitant uhm, uh (pause), but yeah, that's kind of, I kind of get that impression when
they approach me. They don't want to, to, to maybe say something that is completely
wrong also, so they usually, if they're not confident, they prepare what they're going to say
and then they come to me and say it. So, I try not to, to ask questions too much, uhm,
usually just simple basic and that's how I make them feel you know comfortable enough to
converse with me.
Interviewer: And when they prepare do you mean by paper, or you can sense that they've
memorized the sentence?
Jay: Yeah, you can kind of kind of (chuckles) sense, uhm, with my, my co-teacher or I would
say my supervisor teacher at my main school now, she speaks you know like conversational
English somewhat she can communicate, but I sense every time she comes to me, like she
has a paper with notes. And she's young, so I guess she probably feels like she's not good
with her English, and she seems nervous when she comes to me.
Interviewer: And how do you think students perceive English?
Jay: Uhm, I think it, it really depends on the age, but also on the student, uh, individually,
uhm, I would say most students do enjoy English to an extent, but it can be tiring for them
as well. Uhm, they, as fa-, as far as my experience goes, they enjoy learning new phrases
and new words, uhm, especially if it's relatable and, and things that they might have come
across on the internet and so. So, I think they have a somewhat positive, uhm, view of
English.
Interviewer: And does the way that students perceive English either positively or negatively,
does that affect you emotionally?
Jay: Uhm, not really. Uh, I, I'm the kind of teacher who, I don't, I don't like forcing my
students to do things that they are not comfortable with, or that they don't want to do. So, I
do have a few students, uhm, especially at the school that, where I teach on my own that,
are just, you know, they don't pay attention. They don't know English, or they don't know
the ABCs, they can't read, they have no idea. So, with these students I try to involve them,
but they just, have no motivation to learn, so I don't force them, I just kind of let them be
and they learn, some of them learn from their, their classmates. So, I usually let students
work out things amongst themselves, and I don't force them, I don't, I don't scold them; if
they don't want to learn something. Because I know it's hard learning a language, especially
if you don't hear the language every day or all the time. So yeah, I'm kind of indifferent.
Interviewer: And when do you feel frustrated at work?
Jay: Oh, I feel (laughs) usually, I become frustrated, when you know, when the students are
very distracted or they don't want to, to be, how can I say? Active in class, they don't want
to participate, then I become a little frustrated, but usually it, it won't be all the students at
once. It would just be a handful maybe one or two students and that, that's frustrating
when students disrupt your class or when you just feel like ah, you're tired and you don't
have energy to deal with students or...That usually frustrates me and yeah, I would say
after- school classes frustrate me as well.
Interviewer: Oh, why would you specifically say after-school classes?
Jay: Uh (laughs) because I feel like they're kind of futile, they're, they're pointless in a sense
because I'm also on my own and it's usually after-school class, it's you know, it's extra-
curricular. So, kids or the students as I've witnessed, they come to class with the idea that
it's, it's fun time; we're going to have fun it's nothing serious, it's not like you know during
class. So, they some students would just come to the classroom with no pencil, no paper, no
notebook, nothing so, it's like, how can I teach you? If, that's the, the idea that they come
with like so it's, it's fun time, so we're going to watch videos, we're going to play games.
Interviewer: And how do you feel when students perceive... is it because there's a Korean
teacher in the class in the usual lessons? Do they view it a bit differently when you're alone
and after-school classes?
Jay: Oh yes, definitely. Uhm, I would say at my school where I have the co-teachers, uhm,
like during normal class the kids know, you know, it's time for class, it's time to study it,
we're going to be writing, we're going to do things, you know, so they need to be a bit more
serious. Uhm, but when it's, but even if the, the homeroom teacher you know leaves me
alone for a while, the kids will still participate like you know, normal. But after-school class
it's totally wild (chuckles), the kids have no con-, like they, they lack concentration they are
just done for the day, you know. It's like, you know, it's like doing an extra hour of work
after you've knocked off work, so obviously you're not going to pay attention, you're tired,
you just want to relax and yeah. It’s just there's hardly any structure; so that's, that’s what is
really frustrating to me.
Interviewer: And how do you feel when you see the students are participating in the lessons
in the morning, but in the after-school classes they think it's “just a fun time”? How does
that make you feel?
Jay: (Laughs) It makes me feel like a babysitter. Uhm, usually, like, it, usually when I, when
we have, you know good lessons, good classes, interactive classes ; which is, you know, nine,
eight, nine times out of ten, it feels good because you know you feel like the students are
learning, they're enjoying what you're doing and stuff like that. And then when it comes to
after-school class, at my now travel school, because I know, I don't have an English class,
classroom, I have to do the after-school class in the computer room; which is the worst
thing ever. Because as soon as the kids walk in, they turn on the computers and they start
playing games, and it's frustrating because, like, you know, a handful of kids would listen to
me and do what I want them to do, and the others would be playing games. And I can't stop
you because there's such a big class and it's just, uh, it’s terrible.
Interviewer: And have you voiced this to your superiors or co-workers, that you're not
comfortable teaching in the computer room?
Jay: Well, the, uh, principal, I haven't said it, like, specifically to my, my supervisor at my
main school- I haven't told her specifically because I don't want to, to make it a, you know, a
big problem. But I think they put me in the computer room, I think because they had no
other room to put me in, but the principal came to me, and he asked me. He told, you know,
we had a small conversation about what it was like, and I told him, “Yeah, it's not nice” and
he said, “Yes, he can understand and ...” blah blah blah. But that was the extent of it,
because I expressed to him, I said, you know the kids are distracted, they have the
computers in front of them; there's nothing I can do really.
Interviewer: So, do you feel maybe unheard?
Jay: Uhm, at this point (chuckles), because it's been so many years that I've been teaching at
the same school. I don't, uh, feel like if I, I, I told them I was frustrated and I wanted to be
moved to a different room, they would do it; if they could. Uhm, but I (pause) think because
I'm, I'm fairly a very suffer in silence kind of person or I don't like to make my problems
other people's problems, so, uh, I don't think I feel unheard. I just feel like how could they
expect anything else than what is happening, so I just deal with it.
Interviewer: And how do you deal with frustration at work?
Jay: Uhm, sometimes it's, uh, especially with, with after-school students or classes if,
because things are so informal, you know, and it's not rigid, it's not, you know, like study
sessions, so you, sometimes I give them, you know, breaks. I tell them, “Oh it's, it's free time
now, so you can just relax” and some of them would end up doing, you know, homework
from other subjects and stuff and that, that would be my time to deal with my frustration.
So, I would just take time to relax while looking at the students relaxing (chuckles).
Interviewer: So, it's more for you to just have your time because you're so frustrated that
you tell the students, “Okay it's free time” —
Jay: Yeah.
Interviewer: But it's also for yourself.
Jay: Yeah, it's for, basically, for the both of us because I do, I do keep in mind that the
students are quite stressed as well, and they are constantly being told to study and do
things and do things. So, usually they, they really appreciate it when I say it's free time or it's
rest time. And they're like, “Ah, thank you teacher”, so then I feel a bit better you know. I
feel like, okay you can relax, I can de-stress or decompress and it's kind of for the both of us.
Interviewer: And what would you consider an ideal work environment?
Jay: Oh wow! That's a hard question (chuckles) an ideal work environment in my current
situation or just across the board?
Interviewer: Across the board.
Jay: Uhm, wow an ideal work environment would be for me to work from home (laughs),
but uhm, as a, as a native teacher I think having a co-teacher, like one English co-teacher or
like a Korean- English teacher, that could just be with you in each class. I think that would be
the ideal setup for me because then we could, you know, split the work 50/50 and the kids
would know like, these are the English teachers and I feel like it would be more effective.
Interviewer: So, in other words you want a more actively involved co-teacher?
Jay: Yes, I think that would be the ideal situation because, uh, with the homeroom teachers,
you know, it's I appreciate them being there and you know teaching with me or teaching
while I'm there, but, uhm, I do also understand that you know the Korean teachers have a
lot on their plates. So, having a specif-, like, uh, a designated English teacher would be
amazing for everyone.
Interviewer: And what would you consider a good day at work?
Jay: A good day at work would be, uhm, I think the students enjoying class, like me providing,
I would say proper instruction or clear instruction and the kids actually understanding me,
without you know too much confusion and enjoying my activities or worksheets or games,
and just being happy overall. I would usually consider that a good class.
Interviewer: And then how would you feel in that instance?
Jay: I usually feel, uh, (pause) good about myself. And I feel proud of the students and, you
know, those good days make you feel as if you are actually doing something; you're
teaching them something.
Interviewer: And what would you consider a bad day at work?
Jay: A bad day? Oh, let me see (pause). I would say, a bad day at work would be when, you
know, when the students are very tired and stressed, maybe because of something. And
they just, don't want to study, and you know, like there are days where you feel like you,
you're pulling teeth. You need to tell them like, “Oh, come on you need to study it'll be fine”.
Usually, those kinds of classes or days make me feel kind of bad.
Interviewer: And when you're having a bad day at work how does it impact your teaching
capabilities or classroom environments?
Jay: My teaching capabilities, usually, I, if I'm having a bad day, I try not to to, to stress
myself out too much or do too much. Like if, if for example I usually play a game with a
certain class or something like that, and I have no game prepared, I won't stress myself out
about it. I will just do the textbook work and whatever follows, follows. So, I don't try, I try
not to stress about what I need to do with the students, and usually the students will fill the,
the class time. I don't know if I'm explaining this right? (laughs)
Interviewer: Yes.
Jay: But yeah, usually they end up, because in my mind as a teacher I would think of, you
know, like the time that I have with them, and how much I need to do to fill that time to
keep them busy. But sometimes, kids just keep themselves busy with certain activities or
certain you know, uhm, things in the textbook. And that would take up time and usually that
would ease my stress.
Interviewer: And when you are having a good day at work how does it impact your teaching
capabilities or classroom environments?
Jay: Uhm, when I'm having a good day at work, I usually, what do I do? (laughs) I usually, I
don't know, I think the, sometimes the students can sense when you're in a very good mood
or if you're just okay or if you're not quite happy with them, they can kind of sense it. So,
when I have a good day, the kids also seem to have good energy.
Interviewer: And what have you had to adopt or change about yourself to conform to
Korean standards or expectations in the classroom?
Jay: Uhm, well I (pause) I don't think I've changed much about myself, uhm, because I've
always been a person who would kind of adapt to a situation. I'm not who, I'm not very
hard-headed when it comes to how people do things. Uhm, and I always try to be, you know,
polite and, and considerate of others. So that's just my, my natural way of thinking. So, I
don't think I've had to adapt too much, uhm, except to, you know, just always be prepared
for anything, uh, because of you know what they say the Korean surprise (laughs). So, I try
to always kind of be prepared or expect some things to happen, or you know just be flexible
when schedules change or things like that. That's basically, all I try not to be a burden to my
co-teachers.
Interviewer: And when do you suppress unpleasant feelings? When do I suppress
unpleasant feelings?
Jay: Uhm, (pause) when do I suppress unpleasant feelings? I would say, uhm, (pause) maybe
when it comes to, uhm, you know, like, uh, staff interactions. Uhm, sometimes they- the
staff, would, you know, have a meeting or whatever and obviously I'm not included. I'm the
only one who doesn't speak Korean. So, I would just avoid the office when they have a
meeting or when they're having you know conversations and laughing and stuff. I can barely
understand. So, I would just sit in silence, or I would leave and stand in the sun or something
like that. Or yeah, that I wouldn't say it's unpleasant because I can understand the situation,
but I, at this point I feel like, uhm, they kind of know what my personality is like. I don't, I
don't mind not being involved. I don't feel offended by it, and I try not to make others feel
awkward about it.
Interviewer: So, you don't feel uncomfortable maybe?
Jay: Uhm, I guess just when, when they're having conversations in Korean, I feel a little
uncomfortable because I can't understand, and I can't partake. And you know, when you
walk into the office while they're having a conversation about something, and everyone just
stops and looks at you (laughs). So that kind, that's kind of unpleasant. I can't partake in
conversations, uhm, with my colleagues like I would like to, but uhm, yeah that's, that's
about the extent of it, I think.
Interviewer: And how do you react to unpleasant feelings, when you're having these
feelings? What do you do?
Jay: Hmm, to unpleasant feelings? I, I kind of just keep them to myself basically. I don't really
express outwardly. Uhm, so, I would kind of, you know, have inner dialogue with myself and
Interviewer: And how do you mitigate unpleasant feelings?
Jay: Hmm, I would say through distraction, I think. Uhm, when I try to deal with unpleasant
feelings I would rather, I think, distract myself from feeling whatever I'm feeling. So, I would
I don't know, watch videos or maybe listen to music, or do some schoolwork or take a walk,
things like that.
Interviewer: And what is the impact of suppressing these unpleasant feelings at work?
Jay: Uhm, at work (pause) suppressing unpleasant feelings at work, usually they, I would say
because I stress inwards, I don't really relieve, or I would say release my stress properly. It
usually gives me headaches when I get home, or even at school. If I'm stressing about
something or, uh, something is, you know, making me feel bad, I would usually get a
headache.
Interviewer: And what is the benefit of suppressing your feelings at work?
Jay: For me, I don't like to stir the pot so to say (pause). I don't like to, to be confrontational
or to bother people with things that I feel like I could just deal with myself. But I usually just,
you know, sweep things under the carpet or I just ignore things or I, don't know, brush it off.
So yeah, I don't like to, to mix things up.
Interviewer: So, do you see yourself as resilient towards emotion or vulnerable?
Jay: Hmm, I think (pause) it could be either or. I think I'm somewhat resilient, uhm, I try not
to dwell on, on things for too long, and I am very, you know like I said, like I don't like to be
burdensome towards my co-teachers or my homeroom teachers. So, usually I would go with
what they say or what they suggest and sometimes if I have an idea I would tell them if, I
think, you know, it's good. But wait, sorry what was the question? (laughs)
Interviewer: Do you see yourself as resilient towards emotion or vulnerable?
Jay: Oh, yeah. I think it depends on the situation, but I would see myself as more resilient
than vulnerable.
Interviewer: And what cultural differences have impacted your well-being in the workplace?
Jay: Uhm, cultural differences? Uhm, weirdly enough I think there aren't too many, uhm,
differences in culture. But I think when I arrived here it wasn't too big of a culture shock to
me, uhm, because people were not the same, but you know not as different as back home.
Uhm, but I would say the only difference is that people, uh, at work, I think, they, they want
to appear as hard workers, all the time and that is kind of stressful to me. It's like, you don't
have to work all the time, I think.
Interviewer: And do you think that you're treated fairly at work? And if not, how does it
influence your teaching and behavior at work?
Jay: Uhm, I think I, in my position, I think I am treated fairly. Uhm, my schools; both of my
schools like the management is fairly, you know, nice and relaxed. They don't micromanage
me, which is great. Uhm, and they're not very rigid when it comes to things like, you know,
sick days and things like that. So, uhm (pause) yeah, I don't know actually (laughs).
Interviewer: Oh, if you're treated fairly do you consider yourself?
Jay: I think, ah, I think from my point of view, I think so because I've heard, like, you know
my friends, be in worse situations than I am, and they always consider me lucky. So, I think
I'm being treated fairly, for the amount of responsibility that I've been given as a-, as an
assistant teacher, I think I am being treated very fairly.
Interviewer: Do you think your decision is influenced by your friends who maybe put you on
a pedestal that your position is really good and they're having a hard time. Does that maybe
influence your idea of being treated fairly?
Jay: No, I think not. I think that when they tell me about the things that they go through, I
would be shocked because (pause) I would consider that abnormal, because of how my
school has treated me and how nice they've been and, how I would say even lenient ,you
know, very relaxed they are with me. So, when my friends would tell me, “Oh my co-
teacher" is like this and like that. I would be shocked, and yeah. I think that no, like it hasn't
influenced me. I think I've influenced them (laughs) because they look at me and think why
is my school so relaxed? and theirs, you know, are not so.
Interviewer: They're questioning themselves?
Jay: Basically, yes. Bu-but I know it's different in each situation but yeah, luckily my school is
quite nice to me.
Interviewer: And do you consider yourself to be part of a team with staff at school? And if
not do you make any attempts to fit in with colleagues?
Jay: Uhm, no I don't think I would consider myself as part of a team. Like I think of myself as
being there, and working there and, you know, I'm there when they need me for whatever
they need me for. But I don't think I'm really a part of a team. I'm not that involved.
Interviewer: And do you make any attempts to fit in with colleagues?
Jay: Uhm I would say my personality is very awkward (chuckles) so I can't easily, uhm, you
know, initiate conversation and things like that. So, usually when people come to me, and
they talk to me, I will have a blast. I will speak to you and stuff but it's very hard for me to
initiate. So, my personality is very, very I would say, kind of introverted and sometimes that
would be misinterpreted, you know, as being unfriendly or not wanting to socialize but I'm
quite, I'm just introverted. So, yeah—
Interviewer: So, do colleagues not necessarily make, like the effort to involve you with like
say, team sports or something that’s a dinner, or something like that?
Jay: Hmm, they, they do to, to an extent. Last year we had, you know, company or staff
dinners and I was told to come along. They would tell me, “Oh we're playing sport at this
time or that time” but usually they would tell me like, you know, on the day and I would not
be dressed for sport. So, I would usually avoid it or, or not go. So yeah, I think I'm not as
involved because I just don't know things. I'm not told, people forget to tell me. So,I'm not
in the school chat group or whatever. So,I don't know most things that's going on and I'm
kind of fine with it.
Interviewer: Oh, we've reached the end of the interview. Do you have any questions for
me?
Jay: Oh, any questions? What, what is the the, the actual topic of your Master's?
Interviewer: The pedagogical well-being of native English teachers teaching in rural public
elementary schools in South Korea.
Jay Oh, wow. It's very specific.
Interviewer: To break it down, it's just got to do with how does emotion and identity impact
your teaching in the classroom.
Jay Oh, I see. And what made you think of, of that specifically?
Interviewer: Because I'm also an elementary school teacher (chuckles).
Jay: Ah (laughs), at the rural school?
Interviewer: Yes, so there are certain things that I've thought about and emotion actually I
came across, uhm, through reading. But it just clicked to me, something about emotion and
I was really interested with emotion. And wait, if I'm having like a bad day then how does
that actually influence my teaching at school? Or if I'm having a good day how does that
influence my teaching at school? But as, through this research going deep into what
emotion is, there's actually so many layers to emotion. It's not only positive/negative, that's
actually not emotion.
Jay: That is true. That is true. You can have like different degrees of good and bad and yeah.
Interviewer: Yes, but I will give you the results when I finish my thesis in August, so it's soon.
Jay: Okay yes please, all the best.
Interviewer: Oh, do you have any more questions?
Interviewer: No, I think that's all.
Participant 4: Tracey
Interviewer: Okay, welcome to the interview. You can withdraw your consent, or you can
skip to the next question if you wish. The interview style is semi-structured. Okay, so firstly
could you briefly tell me where you are from and for how long you have been teaching at
your current school?
Tracey: I'm from Australia. Uhm, at this particular school I've been teaching for a year and a
half.
Interviewer: And have you had any teaching experience prior—
Tracey: This is not my first school.
Interviewer: And have you had any teaching experience prior to teaching at your current
school?
Tracey: Yes, I have.
Interviewer: And was this in Australia?
Tracey: Some in Australia, some in Korea.
Interviewer: And what age group in Australia, if I may ask?
Tracey: Elementary age group in Australia.
Interviewer: And why were you interested in applying to teach in a public school in South
Korea?
Tracey: Because I like Korean culture. I have friends that are Korean in Australia and I like
teaching too. So, I wanted to combine the two and teach in Korea.
Interviewer: And what is your relationship like with your co-teacher?
Tracey: My co-teacher? Ah, very good. I have two co-teachers. One that looks after, that is,
uh, that is in the room with me. But I teach by myself, but she is in the room. And I have
another one that looks after my admin things, I suppose you could say.
Interviewer: So, your co-teacher is not involved in the dynamics of the classroom? What is
her role in the classroom?
Tracey: Well, she is usually doing her own work basically. She is doing her own work. I teach
basically by myself.
Interviewer: Oh, okay. So, you are teaching English to the students by yourself?
Tracey: Yeah
Interviewer: Without the help of the co-teacher?
Tracey: Yeah, mostly. Occasionally I have trouble explaining something, very rarely. Uh, I can
pretty, I can translate the whole curriculum pretty much, except for a few. The occasional
time where I have trouble and she will step in and help. But uhm, there's a few phrases that
I can't translate out of the kid, uhm, curriculum. But maybe, I'd say maybe two, three maybe
phrases in the whole curriculum I can't translate other than that, uhm, so she might help
with some of those sometimes. But it's very rare.
Interviewer: So, you translate, uhm, from Korean to English for the students?
Tracey: I do, yeah. Because they have to understand. Understanding is, is first priority.
Interviewer: And do you —
Tracey: They can't learn anything unless they understand.
Interviewer: And do you translate phrases or words?
Tracey: Both.
Interviewer: Oh, also phrases?
Tracey: Yeah, well, uh, phrases. Sometimes you can't translate directly into a word. You
need to translate the phrase. So, uhm, I translate both. I make sure my students understand
exactly what every word and every phrase means.
Interviewer: And what is the reaction from students when you speak Korean?
Tracey: Uh, they understand me. They understand me, uh, quite well. They’ve, I've never
had puzzled expressions where they don't understand me. When I first started, it was more
difficult. But now my students understand what I say. So, it's no problem.
Interviewer: So, it's positively received?
Tracey: Yeah, yeah, it's positively received. They hear me. My Korean is not perfect
(chuckles) by a long shot. My Korean is very imperfect. And they hear me making mistakes in
Korean, which I think is valuable too. So, that means that if I can make mistakes in Korean,
and they laugh at my Korean sometimes if I make mistakes, then, they, uh, they're free to
make mistakes in English. I think that's very important.
Interviewer: So, you think it gives them the confidence?
Tracey: Absolutely, I think it does. I want them to make mistakes in English. It's not a case of
I, I, uh, you have to be perfect. I want them to understand that they don't have to be perfect
and that they can make mistakes. And if I can make mistakes in Korean, even if I write,
sometimes I write translations on the board in Korean, and I spell things wrong, they say,
“Teacher, no!” and they stand up and they take the pen off my hand and they correct me.
And that makes it more of an exchange sometimes, because it gives them the freedom to
make mistakes of their own. I can correct them now.
Interviewer: So, you —
Tracey: So, they can correct me.
Interviewer: So, I can assume that you take the central role in the classroom?
Tracey: Yeah, I do all the teaching. Yeah.
Interviewer: And can you describe your usual daily routine at work, in terms of teaching
English?
Tracey: Uh, my daily routine? You mean for each class?
Interviewer: Yes, in a class, for example—
Tracey: Yeah, okay well I have. How I teach my classes?
Interviewer: Yes.
Tracey: I have a whiteboard and I write all the English expressions on the whiteboard. It's
the same every day. Uhm, I have, of course, I have the curriculum up, so we, we, I use YBM
and I use Chongje. I use both. Uhm, I have two different schools. And I also have my own
PowerPoints. I don’t, I teach with the Korean curriculum, but I teach the phrases and words
first before they listen to anything else. So, I pre-teach everything before I, before I teach
with the curriculum.
Interviewer: And you mentioned that you teach at two schools. Is there a difference
between teaching at one compared to the other?
Tracey: In terms of teaching, no. I teach them both the same. The students, in my opinion,
the students learn, uh, understand things better if they have them fully explained first. So, I
teach the words and the phrases. Uh, the younger ones, I teach the words and the older
ones, I teach the phrases because they're, they’re incoming phrases, uh, first. And I get so
that they know, I pull them out of all the curriculum, pull all the words. So, if I'm teaching, I
have a pencil. One of my books has: I have a pencil; I have a ruler. Do you have a pencil? Do
you have a ruler? So, they learn: Do you have...? and they learn, I have, and I don't have.
And then on PowerPoint, I have all my words. So, I have pencil, eraser, ruler, notebook, uh,
these are, I teach all those words first. And I teach the expressions, and then I teach them to
put all those words into the expression. So, we go through and learn the words, and then I
teach the expression, and then they add the words to the expression.
Interviewer: And throughout this, the co-teacher does not assist you?
Tracey: No. She can, she's right there in the room, but, uh, she will come over if she, if she
hears me struggling. I'm sure she's listening. She will come over if she hears me struggling,
but it's, it’s rare. My students can understand. So, uh, that's the most important thing.
When I first started, I had the teacher, the teacher definitely did all the Korean explanation,
but now I'm capable of doing it, so I do it. And my students understand.
Interviewer: So, you have taken over that role? To introduce you to the teaching—
Tracey: Uhm, yeah, and I make sure they understand, because with the stories in the
curriculum, I get them to repeat in English (chuckles). So, they listen to the story twice; they
listen to it once, they just listen once; then they have the words at the bottom the second
time, the subtitle, and the third time we go through it, uh, sentence by sentence, and they
repeat in English, and then they translate for me in Korean. So, I know that they understand.
So, I know they understand everything.
Interviewer: So, do you think that the English curriculum in Korea has enabled you to be an
independent teacher in the classroom?
Tracey: If you, well, if you speak Korean, yes, if you don’t, I think it’s, I don't think you can be
an independent, because the kids have to understand. So, you can teach them, you can
teach some things by not translating to Korean, but maybe you could teach seasons-you can
show them pictures, but you have to, they have to understand what the sentences are
saying. So, if you're teaching: I can run, I can jump, I can sing, you can demonstrate run,
jump, sing, so they understand those words, but how do you demonstrate can? (chuckles) I
can. So, you need to translate that. So, you know, I translate that as halssu-itda which is
Korean for can. So, then they, at least they understand what the whole sentence means.
Interviewer: And how do you usually translate?
Tracey: How do I translate? Well, I translate word for word. I tell them what every part of
the sentence means. So, I translate can as halssu-itda and then I translate run, and I don't
really need to translate run; they understand run. I make sure they understand. I get them
to tell me what run means.
Interviewer: And do you—
Tracey: And then I, they know that what I mean. So, they know what all three of those mean.
And then I get them to say the whole sentence together and translate the whole sentence.
So, individual words and then whole sentence, both.
Interviewer: And do you use any apps or technological devices to translate or the
dictionary?
Tracey: Okay, I, I do sometimes use Papago because my Korean is, I'm still upper beginner.
Uhm, I'm kind of upper beginner heading towards intermediate. So, my Korean is not
particularly high. But uhm, and sometimes if I need to explain something to students that,
that is not just simple translation, then sometimes I need to use Papago. So, uhm, let me
think. Just trying to think of something I had to explain, uh, recently. It's not often, uh
(pause). Please, maybe please. My, my students thought please meant just, uh, jebal, but, i-
it it's kind of juseyo, most of the time. We, in English we use please to ask for things, so I had,
I explained that in Papago. I said, “Yes, it sometimes means that. But most of the time when
we use English, it means, it means juseyo, similar to juseyo. So, we use it as a polite word
when we're asking for things.” So, those sort of things I can't explain in Korean. My Korean, I
can explain in Korean, but it's not, it's not as good, so I use Papago for things like that.
Interviewer: And throughout this translation process, your Korean co-teacher is not involved,
or is she involved?
Tracey: (Pause) She's mostly not involved. She, she can't, she's listening the whole time I
suspect, that she, and because occasionally if I have trouble understanding, she will come
over and help to explain. So, she's listening, but she's not directly involved, no.
Interviewer: And would you consider yourself to be an English teacher or a teacher
assistant?
Tracey: English teacher, I'm a qualified teacher from Australia. I have a, I have a teaching
degree. I taught in Australia as well, elementary school. So, I'm, I have a similar qualification
to what the Korean teachers have here. So, uh, I definitely consider myself a teacher. And I, I,
I care about my students as if I would, as if they were Australian or any other, other country.
I don't, I don't differentiate if I was teaching in Australia, in, I teach, I care about my
students as much as I would if I was teaching an Australian class.
Interviewer: And how do you think you would feel if you were considered a teacher
assistant?
Tracey: I would feel less happy (chuckles), because if, look, if, if I was not a qualified teacher,
if I was someone who had just done an arts degree and come over to teach here and had
not, and really wasn't a teacher, then, then that wouldn't worry me at all. But it only worries
me because it, because I'm a qualified teacher. So, I'm not qualified in Korea as such, but I'm
a, I'm a teacher. I've been trained to be a teacher and I am a teacher. So, that's the reason
why. I-if that wasn't the case, then it wouldn't worry me so much.
Interviewer: And we spoke briefly about the English curriculum. And my question is, when it
comes to decision making regarding the English curriculum test or lesson planning, are you
actively involved?
Tracey: Uhm, the curriculum, I don't get to choose. Uh, I get to choose what I teach in
afternoon class. Uh, the curriculum is given to me. So, I have to teach the curriculum. Uh,
whether, whether I, whether I like it or not, whether it doesn't matter, I have to teach
what's on the curriculum. And I, and we had, you know, my students get tested too, uhm, at
the school level. So, I have to teach towards, make sure that they can do the test. So, I don't
have input into the curriculum. I don't get to choose which books our curriculum comes
from, but I get to choose how I teach it. And that's important to me.
Interviewer: And in terms of your after-school classes, how do you lesson plan for that?
Tracey: I take, I take things that are not actually taught in the curriculum, and I teach them
in afternoon class. So, the curriculum doesn't really teach kids to read. It really, it really
doesn't. So, I teach kids to read in afternoon class. I teach them the alphabet, the alphabet
sounds, and how, and learning to read is learning how to put those sounds together and join
them together. And that's how we teach in English countries. We teach three letter words
and that teaches kids how to put sounds together because they sound differently, different,
uh, the sound, individual sounds sound different to how they're sounding words. So, you
actually have to teach them how to read. So, I do that in afternoon class. I teach them, uh,
lots of English rules. English has a lot of rules, and the curriculum doesn't teach that. So, I
teach Magic E. It's very important because at a, for example, the A has two major vowel
sounds. The O has two major vowel sounds, U, I, E. They all have two major vowel sounds.
They have a short one, which is A, E, I, O, U. And they have a long one, A, E, I, O, U. That's
the long sounds. And some of them have more, it gets more complicated, of course,
particularly with A. But I teach short and long vowels with Magic E.
Interviewer: So, you touch on all of the components of the EL? Grammar, reading, writing,
communication...
Tracey: Exactly. The curriculum only teaches part of that. It doesn't teach all of that. And I
teach the rest of it in my afternoon classes. I also teach word, uh, patterns. Uh, the double O
sound so, look, hook, book, uhm. All, so the kids learn ball, uh, they don't learn all, but I
show them all, ball, small, tall, uh, wall. They learn those words, but it's a pattern, so I teach
them those word patterns. So, then when they see another word that has all in it, they
know it makes that sound, the vowel sound.
Interviewer: And do you think that the English curriculum is conducive in enhancing
communication in Korean students?
Tracey: I think it could be better (laughs). I think it could be better. Let me put it that way.
Interviewer: And in what way would you critique it? How would you critique it?
Tracey: Uh, I think they could teach students more words that I could use. So, for example,
they teach: Do you have a pen? Do you have a pencil? Do you have an eraser? That's a
great, uh, unit. I can use that. But they don't teach right here (chuckles). Uh, they don’t
teach, neither of my curriculums teach the words right, read, right here, uh, listen, the word
listen. I either have to teach the English one or it doesn't teach me words that I can use to
teach very well. It could do that better. So then, if they know the English words, then I can
use them better.
Interviewer: And do you think that you have contributed positively to the end goal of
enhanced English communication among students in the classroom? If yes, how so?
Tracey: Uh, sorry, can you say that again?
Interviewer: Do you think that you have contributed positively to the end goal of enhanced
English communication among students in the classroom? If yes, how so? Have you
contributed positively to the end goal of English communication?
Tracey: Well, yes, in terms of they understand at least what they're learning in the
curriculum. So, at least they understand, and I try to get them to use the English when they
can. And once they've learned the English, I try to use the English because I want them to
hear it. Uhm, English is a lot, learning language is a lot about listening. So, they have to hear
the words as many times as possible. So, in that way, yes.
Interviewer: And how do you think the subject English is perceived by colleagues and
superiors at your school?
Tracey: Uh, I think it's mixed (chuckles). At one school, they really like, they really like my
teaching, and they see that I work very, very hard. So, uh, it's perceived very positively, and
they can see that my students from a year and a half ago have improved a lot. When I went
there a year and a half ago, none of them had any reading (chuckles). Now they can read
and understand (chuckles). It's a big difference. So, they're seeing a big difference in the
students.
Interviewer: So, do you think they respect English more now that you're there, the subject?
Tracey: I think they respect it more when they see it taught well, I suspect (chuckles). I, I
don't know whether they lose respect if they see it taught badly, whether it works the other
way around, that I know, I know that I get respect when they know I'm teaching it well.
Interviewer: And how do you think students perceive English?
Tracey: If they understand it, they perceive it easily. If they don't understand it, they hate it.
And literally hate it. If you can make them understand what the English means and that so
that when they see English or they hear English, they can understand it, it's not so hard for
them. It's easy and they, they quite like it. But if they don't understand, they hate it.
Interviewer: And how do you encourage the students to enjoy English?
Tracey: I teach, I make sure they understand it. It's the most important thing. If they
understand it, then they like it better. It's, it’s that simple. Uhm, and I encourage them all
the time. I tell them they've done great! I get very enthusiastic. So, uhm, I have one student
that is, when I first went there, she was very unenthusiastic. Recently she's gotten a lot
more enthusiastic because she's really starting to understand. This is her, she's in Grade 4.
So, uhm, her attitude has changed. And this is my experience with, uh, I've been teaching in
Korea for, uh, over six years now. So, uh, and that's been my experience with all my schools.
When you actually get them to a stage where they can understand what they're learning,
they like English. And their attitude completely changes.
Interviewer: And when do you feel frustrated at work?
Tracey: When do I feel frustrated? Ah (pause). Ah, I might feel frustrated if something is
preventing me from teaching well. Because I came to Korea because I really wanted to teach.
I love teaching. So, it's not just a, uh, it’s not just a job I do just to be in Korea. I'm, I’m here
because I like to teach. So, I want to be able to do that. Uhm, if I'm hampered in that, then I
get a little frustrated maybe.
Interviewer: And have you been hampered by barriers to teaching? Have you felt that while
teaching at your current school or the other school?
Tracey: Uhm, at one of my schools, I feel less valued (chuckles). At my, at one school I feel
very valued. And at the other school I feel a lot less valued. Uhm, at both schools I teach by
myself. At the second school there is, there is no teacher at all. I teach in the school
classroom alone. Uhm.
Interviewer: Could you explain more about the term of feeling less valued?
Tracey: Uhm, well, the way Korea teaches English and the way I teach English is a little
different I think, traditionally. So, the teachers at that school seem to think that, that
teaching English is mostly getting them to write it over and over again (chuckles). And I don't
agree with that. I think teaching them to read is all about teaching them letter sounds, so
that they can see a word that they've never seen before, and they still can read it. That's
what teaching English is in western countries, in all western countries. It doesn't matter
whether it's America, Australia, England; this is how we teach English in our countries. But I
don't know how many Korean people think that just writing it over and over again will teach
them to read. But at this school they seem to think that, and they don't agree with my
teaching method, which is to teach them letter sounds, and teach them to read slowly with
smaller words and gradually teaching them letter patterns. I don't think they agree with that.
I'm saddened by that because I'm fairly sure I'm right. But uhm, it's their school so I, I can't
convince them that I'm right (chuckles).
Interviewer: So, you follow the rules?
Tracey: Well, I. Yeah, well. Yeah, I don't teach reading much there because they, they prefer
to, you know, for example, uh, when I was teaching Grade 3, I taught the first lesson in
Grade 3 is: What's this? "What's that? So, you know, you can, you know, w-h together, you
know, my students at that stage don't, in that school didn't know all the letter sounds yet.
So, I'm just teaching them. I just started teaching Grade 3, I was new at that school at the
time and I, you know, I teach a few letter sounds every week in afternoon class. So, I'm
gradually building up so that I can teach them to read but the teacher in that class was just
getting to write: what's this?, what's this?, what's this? All the way down the page (chuckles).
He was trying to get them to read: what's this? what's this? what's this? And I'm sure that
by the time they finish writing it they could probably recognize those two words; but that's
not reading. Reading is recognizing sounds and putting them to words.
Interviewer: So, there's not really a focus on communication at that school? English
communication, speaking?
Tracey: Well, yeah, there is but not teaching them to read properly in my opinion. So, their
uh, method of teaching them to read sounds to me like it's similar to teaching people to
read characters, which is Chinese writing, maybe. I'm not sure whether it comes from that,
but English is phonetic, and we need to teach it in a phonetic way, so that they can read.
Getting them to write: what's this? what's this? all the way down the page after one English
lesson (chuckles) doesn't really teach them much in my opinion. But uhm, teaching them,
teaching them t-h together says the th sound over time, after they've learned all the
alphabet, that teaches them to read.
Interviewer: Then what is your role in the classroom? If there's not really a focus on
communication in that specific class?
Tracey: Ah, in that class, this is, this is, it's taught separately. I teach the curriculum and
that's completely communication. I teach everything in the curriculum, so that they
understand it and they do, but the classroom teacher teaches them writing separately
outside my teaching.
Interviewer: Oh, okay. So, it is separate?
Tracey: Yeah, exactly. So, uhm, you know, he's teaching them to write these words and they
don't even know the letter sounds. They don't know what they're writing (chuckles) and no
one says, “What's this?”. That's all they understand. They don't know, uh, the s sound in this.
They don't know the i sound in this. If they don't know that, so they're just writing. Uhm, it'd
be the same as someone telling me to write this, to write a certain, write: What's this? in
Chinese. I don't know what I'm writing. I don't understand Chinese and they're getting them
to do the same thing. In my opinion, you need to teach them the sounds, to go with the
words. But uhm, yeah and I don't have control over that, and I don't teach afternoon class in
that school anymore (chuckles). So, uh, i-it-it’s I don’t have control over that, and I can’t say
to them, “This is wrong, you should teach it my way” because that's their way. I don't have
any control over that, so I just teach the curriculum in that school. I teach, I teach what's on
the curriculum and they teach the reading and writing; or I hope they do.
Interviewer: Does the way that students perceive English positively or negatively affect you
emotionally?
Tracey: Uhm, it affects me a lot because I want my students to like English and the reason, I
want them to like English is because they're going to learn a lot better. If they hate English,
they're not going to learn very well. If they like English, then they're happy learning English,
then they're going to learn English much faster and much more efficiently. It's very
important to me and I care about my kids. I care about their welfare, you know, I care about
their confidence mostly. So, if they're not confident in English, they're not going to do well. I
want them to be confident, so I work really hard at making them confident. And the way to
make them feel confident in themselves-feel confident, is to make them understand English
and feel as though they're good at it. So, that’s, that’s my strategy.
Interviewer: How do you deal with frustration at work?
Tracey: Frustration? Uh, I don't really get that much frustration because I get, when I first
arrived at the school (chuckles) and they couldn't read, I thought, oh, I have to teach them
to read. I've got a whole school of kids who can't read, so I have to start again and teach
them to read. But now it's a year and a half later and all my kids, not all of them, but
because I have very low-level students too; who are not good at any of their subjects, you
know, their learning level is very low. But they're all learning at capacity now and the ones
that can, could, that can learn to read have, have learned to read and they all find, they all
find, well I wouldn't say they all find it easy, but they all understand what they're learning
now. Because they can read it off the page too and they can understand it when they hear it,
so their confidence is much higher. I have my Grade 4 girl I mentioned before, she's gone
from really hating English to being really confident. She comes in and she's a different girl
than she was a year ago, completely different girl. So that's, that’s where I get the joy from
teaching from.
Interviewer: And what would you consider an ideal work environment?
Tracey: Ideal? Uh, an ideal work environment? Uhm, I don't know whether there is an ideal
work environment. I think there is, uhm, lots of things that have to match. So, for me,
personally, an ideal work environment is happy, is kids that come in that are, uh, learning
well and the people around me, uhm, are supporting or supportive at least, not
unsupportive. And, and everyo-, I feel that everyone is friendly. So, when the teachers are
friendly; they often bring in cake, they bring me cake, the teachers say hello to me every day,
they have little conversations with me, all the teachers from various, uhm, parts of the
school, uh, admin staff too, have little conversations with me wherever I go. So, I'm treated
like a normal teacher, the same as I would be in my country. So, uh, that's an ideal
environment for me.
Interviewer: And what would you consider a good day at work?
Tracey: A good day at work? Uh, most of my days are good days at work really (laughs). I
enjoy teaching, I really love it, that's why I'm still here. A good day at work is when: when
my students have learned well, when I've had an enjoy-enjoyable time with some of the
staff as well, uh I've gotten what I wanted to get done, you know, preparation as well, you
know, I do a lot of preparation, I make new games. Sometimes I look at the games that are
coming up and I think, ah this isn't going to work for this particular child because they have
this problem or uhm, ooh this one is doing really well, I need to make a game that challenges
them because I haven't got a game for this particular thing that challenges. So, I make a new
game, I make a lot of games for my students. Uhm, you know, if I get all those things done,
then it's a good day and most of my days are like that.
Interviewer: You mentioned, uhm, in your ideal work environment that when you are
treated as an equal, as a teacher, you feel happy. Are there times when you feel you do not
get treated as a teacher?
Tracey: Yes, that's, that’s the key. I want to get treated like a teacher because that's what I
am, I'm a qualified teacher and, and, you know, to my, to my knowledge I behave like a, like
a qualified teacher. I care about the kids, I put a lot of effort in, and I try to teach them well.
So, I (pause) should, I should feel, you know, I should be an equal teacher in those ways,
because I am, I feel like I am.
Interviewer: Are there instances where you feel that uhm, your teaching qualification gets
questioned?
Tracey: Uhm, at the, at the school that doesn't, that doesn’t, uhm, agree with my teaching
method to teach them to read, yes. I don’t think, I think they think that they can teach the
kids better than what I can (chuckles), maybe. I'm not sure. They certainly don't agree with
my teaching the kids to read with, uhm, letter sounds. So, uh they just want the kids to
write the words over and over again. Uhm, I, I feel as though my teaching isn't wonderfully
respected there. I don't think it's disrespected, but, uh, they certainly don't respect teaching
them to rea-, like I, you know, my methods of teaching them to read, let me put it that way.
Uhm, which kind of annoys me a little bit because, well, I got trained at university on how to
teach kids to read in an English University as an English person. So, I kind of feel as though I
have some authority on that (chuckles). Uhm, and I'm not saying Korean people, teachers
are bad because I actually quite admire a lot of Korean teachers. I think Korean teachers are
wonderful, but I would hope that they would at least listen to, uhm, someone who does
have a background in, in that kind of background.
Interviewer: What would you consider a bad day at work?
Tracey: A bad day at work? Ahh, I don't really have bad days at work. Uhm, the worst day I
think I've ever had in a Korean school at work was when I was told at my last school that I
had to move schools. That wasn't a happy day (laughs) because I love my students and my
students were doing really well. I had gotten them to a stage where the teaching was
effortless. They would come in and see the, see the new lesson they'd never seen up on the
board and they'd know most of the words and there'd be one or two words they didn't
know, and I would translate those words for them, and then they would know what the
whole sentence meant. They were just awesome. So, I had them to that stage. Uhm, for
example, my Grade 3, 4, I think they were Grade 4 at the time, they came in and I had,
What's your favorite subject? My favorite subject is... on the board and they didn't know
the word subject (laughs). So, what's your favorite? and subject, what's subject? and I
explained subject, uh, guamuk is subject and they said ah! and then they translated it
completely and they understood (laughs). Lesson taught (chuckles) and they were only
Grade 4. So yeah, so that was, (pause) that's, uhm...
Interviewer: A bad day at work.
Tracey: I forgot what the question was now, I'm sorry. I ramble on. I ramble (laughs).
Interviewer: And when you are having a bad day at work, how does it impact your teaching
capabilities or classroom environment, if you're not having a good day?
Tracey: If I'm not having a good day, uhm, I try, I try not to let it affect my teaching if I'm not
having a good day. Uhm, (pause) I don't really have bad days (chuckles) Uhm, as such. Other
than being told that I have to move schools, oh that's right, sorry, that was where I was,
yeah. So, I had, yeah, so I had my students at that level and I, and I had to move schools and
I was disappointed about that, because I had gotten, I had, I had built up this school so that
the kids were reading well and learning well. And then, I had to move to a new school. So,
uhm, and I, and they didn't tell me why? So, I, uh, I found out since that it's because they
just move us around, uhm the same, they try to move us around the same as they move
other people around; other, you know, Korean teachers around. So, uhm, and they could,
and there was a school that I could move to, so they moved me.
Interviewer: And when you're—
Tracey: That’s what they told me.
Interviewer: And when you're having a good day at work, how does it impact your teaching
capabilities or classroom environment?
Tracey: The teaching probably gets a bit inspired (laughs). I probably teach a bit more
inspirationally if I'm having a good day at work. My days are kind of fairly similar these days.
I don't have good and bad days as such. Most of my days are pretty, pretty good days. Uhm,
I get, I, uh, I teach by the seat of my pants sometimes. You know, I-I-I have less, I have my
lessons all prepared always ahead of time, so I know exactly what I'm teaching. And
sometimes I look at a lesson, I think, you know, I could do it, I could do it better if I do this
today (laughs). And I change it. And sometimes I get halfway through a lesson, and I think,
you know, I could do it better this way, and I change it halfway through. So, uhm, maybe I
do that better when I'm, uhm, when I'm having a good day, maybe. And maybe I do that less
well when I'm having a bad day. Uh, as I said, I don't really have bad days as such, much
anymore. Yeah, I think it might affect, affect my, my teaching efficiency because as a
teacher, you can't always just follow a plan (chuckles). You can make a plan, but you
shouldn't be stuck to it. You should be able to, you should be very flexible so you can change
it. If your students aren't understanding, then you have to change something to make them
understand. So, I'm probably better at that if I'm, uh, if I’m feeling good about myself, I
guess.
Interviewer: And what have you had to adopt or change about yourself to conform to
Korean standards or expectations in the classroom? If so, please explain.
Tracey: Ooh, do I have to change? Uh, about myself?
Interviewer: To conform to Korean standards or expectations in the classroom?
Tracey: To conform to Korean, uhm, there are things that are different. Like I give out little,
little, I give out little gifts and things for my students when they've done their homework
well, and, uh, they've remembered their homework well. I give them a test. They have a, a
sihom (chuckles) a test at the beginning of every class. Their homework, I give them
homework at the end of every class, and they come in the next day, and they have to have,
uhm, done their homework. So, a sentence usually, uhm, uhm, do you have a ruler? maybe
might be the sentence for Grade 3. So, they have to write that. And then the next day,
sihom so I give them a blank piece of paper and I dictate to them, Do- you- have- a- pencil?
And they have to get that perfect. If they do, then they get five stamps. So, I give out those
sorts of things. I don't do that in Australia.
Interviewer: So, you haven't had to change your behavior or attitude?
Tracey: Uhm, not really. I think Korean people and Korean students might be a little, a lot
more sensitive than what Australian kids are. Australian kids, I discipline much harder, I
think, than Korean kids. Uhm, I don’t, I try not to discipline them here, if I can get out of it,
uhm, because I try to teach more by, by (pause) relationship, which is what you should do in
every classroom, even in Australia, but, uhm Australian kids are more hardy, I think. Uhm,
and you can discipline the child a bit more harshly. In Korea, I don't think harshness works at
all. I think you have to be gentle at all times, I think I teach differently in that way. If I went
back to Australia, I'd have to learn to be harsh again. Uh, Yeah, in Korea, I think harshness
doesn't work with Korean kids at all. I think gentleness and relationship works very well. And
it, it certainly works in all my classes. Uhm, I don't, I never yell at the kids. I very rarely, I very
rarely speak in anything other than friendly tones to them, and I very rarely have to.
Interviewer: So, do you think you've changed in terms of, you're a bit more softer with the
Korean students compared to Australian students?
Tracey: A lot more softer, yeah. I think I've changed in that way. If I went back to Australia, if
I was as gentle as what I am now, the kids would walk all over me (chuckles). So, that does
not work in Australia. Different things work in Australia to what works here, I think that's
the point. Uhm, harsh, being harsh and strict disciplinary doesn't work in Korea, uhm, as
much as it's required in Australia because the kids are less disciplined in Australia (laughs).
Well, unless you, the teacher has to take command in Australia, whereas here it's different.
If you have a good relationship with your kids, they just give you command. It doesn't, it
works the opposite way. So, it's a different culture.
Interviewer: So, a good relationship is really important?
Tracey: Oh, absolutely. Because you can't communicate, it's very hard to build up
relationships in Korea. It's harder than it is in Australia. You can talk to kids in Australia, but
you can't here as much because of language difference. So, the first thing I do is build up
that relationship, really, really important. So, I did that at one school, I remember by, I had
Grade 2 two moving into Grade 3. So, I'd make, I used to make fun of them as they're
walking down the hallway. I'd copy their body language basically. And they could (laughs),
there's a mirror at the end of the hallway, uh, one of the toilet mirrors, so that, uh, was
directly in front. So, they could see me copying them and I knew they could. So just having
fun, making fun with them. So, you're building that relationship before you even have to
teach them. That, that worked for me, uh, just building that relationship. So, it's just
anything, funny little things in the hallway, oh, what are you doing? What's that? Oh, I like
your shirt, that sort of thing. Being interested in them, that's building relationships. And you
do that outside the classroom, more than you do that inside the classroom.
Interviewer: And just getting back to the, uhm, L1 to L2 that you do, you translate the first
language to the second language, English. How do you think that affects your identity as a
teacher translating from the first language Korean, translating it to the second language
English?
Tracey: My identity as a teacher?
Interviewer: Yes, do you think that affects your identity as a teacher or in terms of like
English is viewed a certain way and Korean, the identity and culture and things like that?
Tracey: Uhm, I don't think it affects my identity as a teacher. I think the languages are very
different. I think, uhm, the languages are very different. So, when you translate, I try to
translate literally a lot because I want them to understand what each word means. And then
I say, “Well, in Korean, you would say this, right?” So, there's, uhm, you know, uhm, you
know there’s a lot of a lot of things, oh, good in the curriculum, and in Korean they just go,
neh. So, there's, there’s what they would really say in that situation, and then there's direct
translation. And I try to do a bit of both. The direct translation is important to understand
what the words actually mean. And then they, they need to also know that this means the
same this in Korean. So, there's a lot of things that they answer, neh, instead of, oh, we say:
Oh, good, okay? (laughs) So, does that answer the question?
Interviewer: Yes. And when do you suppress unpleasant feelings?
Tracey: Suppress unpleasant feelings?
Interviewer: That you may feel in the classroom while teaching or interacting with a co-
teacher or a colleague?
Tracey: Uhm, (pause) if a student's not listening properly, then I have to suppress
annoyance, I guess. So, sometimes you have students who -and it's not that they're
misbehaving, it's just that they're not tuning in properly. And you have to, sometimes have
to re-teach. So, you have to be patient. It might be frustrating that you have to, re, re, re-
explain something. I had a situation the other day where one student, uhm, I should have,
and to be fair, I should have noticed that she wasn't listening properly. And I usually do. I'm
usually on her and saying, "Listen”, so that she's listening, because she tends to drift off.
Uhm, and then, I catch them not listening and I often say, “You translate” (laughs). And I say
that purposefully because I know they weren't listening, and it demonstrates that they
should have been listening, so that they'll listen better next time, I hope. And then I have to
explain again, because she didn't understand. So that's pretty frustrating. That's another
two or three minutes out of my lesson that I have to re-explain. That doesn't happen very
often. It just happened the other day once. So, uhm, that's annoying, but I have to, you
know, I can't take my frustration out on her. So, I have to re-explain and say, “Next time you
need to listen, right? Okay, I will tell you again.” (laughs) So, things like that, maybe.
Interviewer: And how do you react to unpleasant feelings, when you have this feeling of
annoyance or frustration?
Tracey: I always, I always try to look at it, make sure I'm looking, not just looking at it from
my point of view. So, the student, there may be a reason why the student wasn't listening.
Uh, in this girl's case, uhm, she's just not a good listener. She doesn't listen well. She drifts at
all times. She goes into her little imaginary world, I think, sometimes. But uhm, she's not a
high-level student. She's a low-level student. Uhm, but (pause) you can't, you can’t take
your frustration out on them, because if I do, then they're not going to learn as well. If they
can see that I'm frustrated with them, then that's going to upset them, and their listening is
going to be worse. So, (pause) so, I try to look at it from their point of view and think, okay,
well, maybe they're hungry. Maybe they're, you know, so if you look at it from someone
else's point of view, you can't, the frustration just disappears. You don't, you don’t harbor
that frustration because you're always making sure that you see it from their point of view
as well. And sometimes it's a 40-minute lesson. It's at the end of the lesson. They've been
listening half the 30 minutes. They're tired. So, you have to always look at it from their point
of view. And that's what teaching is all about anyway, is seeing it from a student's point of
view. Otherwise, you shouldn't be teaching.
Interviewer: And how do you mitigate these unpleasant feelings?
Tracey: Uhm, well, I don't really get unpleasant feelings much. I'm so used to doing it. I've
been doing it for over five or six years now, six years, a long time anyway. And then in
Australia before now, so, uhm, you know, it's a fleeting frustration, I think, oh, I have to
explain it again. Okay. And I know I can't get frustrated with students. So, I just think, okay,
I'll explain it again. And then I always say to her, "You need to listen” and I explain it again.
And as soon as, as soon as I have the thought then I think, okay, maybe she's tired today,
then the frustration is gone. So, it's just very fleeting. As soon as I think, okay, (laughs) this is
the situation, and then I move on. So, it's really, it’s really not that difficult.
Interviewer: And what do you think is the benefit of suppressing your feelings at work?
Tracey: Ah.
Interviewer: Unpleasant feelings.
Tracey: Unpleasant feelings. Uhm, if it's, if it’s a big frustration, if it's with the students, it's
absolutely beneficial. I have no problem, uhm, with the students ever, really. When I first
got there, it was frustrating that they didn't know English, they didn't know reading, but
that's not their fault, right? So, you have to teach them at their level, whatever level they're
at, and you have to bring them back. Uhm, It's the external things outside the actual
teaching that are more frustrating than the actual teaching. I never get frustrated with my
teaching much, really. I just teach them from where they're at.
Interviewer: And with these external factors, what are you referring to when you say these
external factors?
Tracey: Uhm, external factors, uhm, well, I don’t really (pause) well, it's frustrating with the,
uh, one school that, that, uhm, would that teaches reading with a different method, shall
we say, than the one I think, which is teaching by sounds, word sounds, rather than just
teaching them to recognize what a word looks like. Uhm, I find that frustrating. Uhm.
Interviewer: And do you suppress any unpleasant feelings in relation to work colleagues or
management?
Tracey: Uh, yeah, I have to because I can't get angry at that, because it's not in my control.
So, I have to decide whether it's in my control or not. That's not in my control, so you
basically have to let it go. And it's still a little frustrating, but uhm, it's something I can't
change, so there's no point in getting, getting frustrated. I can't take it out on the teachers, I
can't say, “You're teaching wrong” (laughs). That's not going to work. So, uhm, I just have to
think, okay (laughs), this is where my limit is, so I, uhm, I just have to let it go.
Interviewer: Okay. So,do you think in that instance, you don't have any voice when it comes
to engaging with work colleagues or co-teachers?
Tracey: Uh, well, I mean, in a lot of ways, as a, as a, you know, we are guest teachers as such.
As a foreign guest teacher, I probably have a lot of freedom, to be fair, because nobody tells
me how to teach. I've never had a single co-teacher who said, no, no, no, I think you should
teach like this, I want you to change the way you teach. Nobody has ever said that to me,
ever. Not even the first year, week I came. Every co-teacher I've had has always been very
happy with my teaching, so, uhm, to be fair, I have a lot of freedom. Nobody ever tells me
you should teach, and I change the curriculum a lot. I don't teach it in the same way that it's
presented on the page. Uh, I do, I do all the activities in a completely different order to what
they are in the book. They do a lot of the listening last rather than first. I teach all the
phrases and everything that's new first before we even look at the curriculum. So, I do, I
change a lot of things, and nobody's ever stopped me from doing that, probably because it
works (chuckles). Uhm, the students will look and listen to a story when they understand
what all the words are in the story better than just listening to a story, uhm, when they
understand what all this words are in the story better, than just listening to a story without
understanding it. So, it’s kind of, for me, it's a no-brainer. Uhm, so, I've had a lot of freedom,
but I don't have freedom over things like what the classroom, how the classroom teacher
teaches their kids to read when I'm not teaching them. So, at my other school, at one school,
I can teach them to read, so I teach them the whole thing, and I know they read. And the
two mixed together, I teach them grammar from, uh, that the curriculum doesn't teach. I
teach spelling and words that the curriculum doesn't teach, and the other school that I have
less, that I can't teach them to read- but the classroom teacher is apparently doing that,
then I just teach them the curriculum. Uh, I have no control over that. So, if it affects
anything, it probably affects my motivation a bit. I'm a lot more motivated at the school
where I get to teach what I consider the whole curriculum, uhm, the whole thing, so the kids
understand really well, as opposed to the school where I just teach the curriculum without
teaching all the extras that they need to understand behind the curriculum. Any questions?
Interviewer: Yes, thank you. And do you see yourself as resilient towards emotion or
vulnerable?
Tracey: Do I see myself as emotional vulnerable? Is that the question?
Interviewer: Do you see yourself as resilient towards emotion or vulnerable?
Tracey: Uhm, mostly resilient. I think I'm mostly resilient. Uhm, I think if I come here when I
was very young, I wouldn't be anywhere near as resilient, but I'm here by myself. Uh, I came
here not knowing a single person in this country, uhm, and, you know, if I had problems, I
sought them out myself. Uh, when I first came here, I was very unsure about a lot of the
things I did. I had taught in Australia, but I'd never taught Second Language, so here it's the
first time teaching Second Language. So, I think I'm fairly resilient, you know, things happen
sometimes, and I have to learn to get over them. Uhm (pause), so, I think I'm mostly, mostly
resilient. I think I'm, I’m a, I’m an emotional person, I'm a sensitive person, and an
emotional person. I think I'm fitting in in Korea quite well for that reason, but I'm also fairly
resilient, I think. And I'm older as well.
Interviewer: And do you think that you are treated fairly at work? If not, how does it
influence your teaching and behavior at work?
Tracey: I think that, that particular thing would influence a lot in every workplace, not just
teaching. Uh, I feel as though I'm treated very fairly. If anything (chuckles) I feel as though
I'm treated more than fairly at one of my schools. And the other school, they don't treat me
unfairly, it’s not, they don’t treat me unfairly at all. They, uhm, I, I I just have less interaction
with the teachers there. They don't treat me unfairly or not to my knowledge, but I just
have less of a relationship there. Uh, they’re not, they’re not , they don’t treat me unfairly,
or not to my knowledge, uhm, but, uh, I just have less of a relationship there. At, at the
school that I'm treated exceptionally well, I would say I'm treated at one school, uhm, I'm
really motivated, I do extras; I come home and sometimes I think, oh, I could do this with
those kids. And I make things at home sometimes, I wrote them, I can program a little bit
and I wrote them a listening app because they don't get enough listening. And, I put all of
their, it's taken me a few thousand hours (laughs), but I've taken all the listening part out of
their curriculum, and I put it into an app and they have to listen to it and then they have to
find all the words. So, it's, uh, an app that makes them listen and it helps them with reading
as well. Uhm, so I'm really motivated at that school. I do work at home for that school and
happily so, I enjoy it. At the other school, I don't. I just teach on the day (chuckles). So, I'm
less motivated at that school. But I teach them as well as I can, I don’t, because it’s how I
feel at any school, shouldn't affect how I teach the kids. But I don't do extra work at home
for them.
Interviewer: And my last question, do you consider yourself to be part of a team with staff
at school? And if not, do you make any attempts to fit in with colleagues?
Tracey: At my main school, the teachers that treat me really, really well, absolutely. They
treat me as if I'm just, I'm a staff member at ju-, the same as all the other teachers.
Absolutely they do. Uhm, at, so at that school, absolutely. At the other school, they treat me
as if I'm a visitor that they wish they didn't have (laughs), I feel. So, I have two complete
opposite schools.
Interviewer: That is quite a strong statement.
Tracey: Yeah, I don't think they hate me, to be fair. I think they, I don't think they just want
me to like me, even. I think I feel as though I'm not as welcome in that school, though. So, I
(chuckles) at my, at my comfortable school, I go in and say, “Hi, how are you?” I'm a very,
fairly vivacious sort of person, and I'm happy and everything. At the other school, I quietly
walk up the stairs and go into my classroom (laughs). So, it's a different, I feel restricted at
the other school, that I mean, I don't hate going there- I just I feel a bit less, less loved, I
suppose you could say (chuckles). But I treat, I teach the kids as well as I can, uh, in the, in
the class; I just don't do extra work for them. That's all. Yeah.
Interviewer: Thank you very much. Do you have any questions for me? About the research?
Tracey: No, not really. No. Uhm, yeah, it's, I mean, my criticism of the other school is
probably, probably sounds harsh, harsher than what it actually is. Uh, I like teaching those
kids. They're good. I just feel as though I have less control over what I'm teaching. And I can
just teach the curriculum. And, but I can't, I feel as though I can teach half the curriculum,
which is, I find frustrating, rather than the whole curriculum, which is what I do at the other
school. So, the kids understand fully. Uhm, that says most of my frustration, but I don't hate
the school as such. I just, I just, it's just a different, different atmosphere (chuckles), I
suppose you could say. But, you know, the, the staff there are lovely. There's, there’s, uhm,
a care teacher and the, and the cleaner and the cook, and those people; they're lovely. So,
uhm, it’s, they don’t treat me badly at all. I just don't feel as I, I'm fitting well in that school, I
suppose you could say.
Interviewer: Thank you very much for your time with the interview. And if you have any
questions, you can contact me.
Participant 5: Ashlee
Interviewer: Thank you for participating in the interview. You can withdraw consent at any
time or you can skip to the next question if you don't feel like answering it.
Ashlee: Okay.
Interviewer: Could you briefly tell me where you are from and for how long you have been
teaching at your current school?
Ashlee: Okay, so I'm originally from the Caribbean but I grew up and I'm also a citizen of the
U.S. and I have been in my current school since June 2016.
Interviewer: And you teach at a public rural elementary school?
Ashlee: Yes, I do.
Interviewer: And have you had any teaching experience prior to teaching at your current
school?
Ashlee: Uh, yes, for eight years, uhm, prior to that.
Interviewer: And where did you teach?
Ashlee: I taught in Korea as well as in Malaysia.
Interviewer: And was this at a public school or a private school?
Ashlee: Yeah, both publics.
Interviewer: So, you've taught at a public school in Malaysia and a public school in South
Korea?
Ashlee: Correct.
Interviewer: Before 2016?
Ashlee: Correct.
Interviewer: And why were you interested in applying to teach in a public school in South
Korea?
Ashlee: Uhm, so in 2008 when I first came to Korea, I was placed at a public school. And
then, for my first year but then I moved to one of the bigger cities my second year, and I was
placed in a hagwon, and, uh a private academy. And after that experience, I decided I didn't
want to ever do a hagwon again (laughs).
Interviewer: And what is your relationship like with your co-teacher?
Ashlee: Uhm, so, my co-teacher actually, I don't work with him because he teaches the first
grade, but I work with the other teachers; the homeroom teachers. But my co-teacher, he's
my current co-teacher; he's pretty nice, friendly and you know, we're just like professionals.
So, he helps me when I need help and so forth.
Interviewer: So, what is the role of your co-teachers?
Ashlee: So, this current co-teacher, he just really helps me like if something is from the
Education Office and I needed, I need to get information, he gives that to me. When it was
time to do my visa renewal, he's the one who gave me all the information and prepared all
those documents.
Interviewer: So, he takes on more of the administration?
Ashlee: Yeah, he's a more admin type.
Interviewer: And the homeroom teacher, they are your assistant teacher or...?
Ashlee: Basically, yeah, they help me with translation. Uhm, yeah, mostly they help with
translation if I need that or they help describe, uh, go to more description of whatever
concepts we're learning, that day in class.
Interviewer: And what is your role in the classroom?
Ashlee: So, I do the lessons. I do the planning. I, uh, carry out the lessons, uhm, make all the
activities and so forth. So, I'm like basically, I’m the main English teacher for that class. The
students, I believe, do not do other English lessons with their teachers; only with me.
Interviewer: So, you are the sole source of learning English within your —
Ashlee: Within public school, yeah.
Interviewer: Okay. And do you teach at one public school, or do you teach at multiple public
schools?
Ashlee: I teach at three public schools, one elementary, two middle school.
Interviewer: And uhm, what is the classroom dynamic like teaching with your co-teacher?
Ashlee: At the?
Interviewer: At the elementary school.
Ashlee: The elementary school?
Interviewer: Yes.
Ashlee: So, yeah, well I mean with the homeroom teachers, because I don't teach with the,
ah, my co-teacher, co-teacher, but yeah with the elementary teachers or the—?
Interviewer: The study is focusing on elementary students, elementary schools.
Ashlee: Okay.
Interviewer: So, what is the classroom dynamic like, then teaching with the homeroom
teachers at your elementary school?
Ashlee: Okay, so, yeah, no, it's pretty cool. We're, uhm, they’re all very laid-back
atmosphere, uhm, you know, if I need help with something like a quick translation, they're
there to assist. Uhm, and, yeah, so, you know, we chat about random stuff as well. Uh, last
year, my previous co-teacher, he actually taught with me. So, we did do a lot of, you know,
bouncing off of each other. Uhm, and then we would do various open classes, for example.
So, with that homeroom teacher, he transferred because after five years, he had to transfer.
But, uhm, he transferred this, or March term. Uhm, but we did do a couple of open classes
together. And I assisted him with his, uh, I forgot what it was called, but it was like a, a teach
abroad type, uh, grant that homeroom teachers, that Korean teachers were given to go to
California to teach for an entire month at a U.S. public school. So, I assisted him with that.
So, we had a pretty good relationship. And uhm, you know, he writes me my letters of
recommendations and everything like that.
Interviewer: So, the role of a co-teacher, it's dependent on their personal preference?
Ashlee: True, true. Yeah, I'd say so.
Interviewer: Would you consider yourself to be an English teacher or a teacher assistant?
Ashlee: In this city, I would say in this public school, I would consider myself the English
teacher in the elementary school.
Interviewer: Could you elaborate more on why you see yourself in this role?
Ashlee: (coughs) So, I'm sorry. In this one, I would say because I see myself, because a lot of
them are not getting outside help and a lot of them do not go to Hagwons. They just have
me as a teacher. And as I said, some of the homeroom teachers do not do English classes
with them, unless they have to, unless maybe the student is like lacking in something. But
then the teacher might do a one-on-one with them later on. But the teachers rely only on
me solely for teaching them English.
Interviewer: So, the teacher is basically more there for discipline and —
Ashlee: Translation.
Interviewer: Translation.
Ashlee: Yeah.
Interviewer: But not physically teaching alongside you?
Ashlee: Correct.
Interviewer: And can you describe your usual daily routine at work?
Ashlee: Okay. So, when I get to work, uhm, you know, after preparing the classroom and
everything, uhm, I would have maybe, depends on the day, four or six periods to teach.
Uhm, and they're about 40 minutes each lesson. So, I just prepare, you know, the
PowerPoint slides, get any manipulatives I need for my, the class. And yeah, just get the, get
everything ready for the students to teach that day, uhm, for the class. And then when they
come in, they, we have a routine because all the routines. So, I'd be like, “All right, books,
pencils, eraser, file”. So, the students would know, okay, they need their books, a pencil,
they need to get a file and, or their notebook as well.
Interviewer: And during the lesson planning stages, do you ever present your lesson plan to
your co-teacher about the lesson or any type of communication about the lesson?
Ashlee: Nope, we don't (chuckles). In the beginning, maybe my first year, the first few
months, I would show them my lesson plans, but they don't really ask me for those anymore,
to be honest.
Interviewer: And when it comes to decision-making regarding the English curriculum tests or
lesson planning, are you actively involved?
Ashlee: Yeah, I do all that on my own. Uhm, so, for the elementary school, I do all of that on
my own. Uh, actually, I did two tests for the fifth and sixth graders today, review tests. So,
I'm the one who does all of that.
Interviewer: And there's no guideline to help you with the testing?
Ashlee: What do you mean by the guideline? It's all from the material from the curriculum.
So, I use those.
Interviewer: Okay, so it's from the textbook?
Ashlee: Correct.
Interviewer: And do you think that you have contributed positively to the end goal of
enhanced English communication among students in the classroom? If yes, how so?
Ashlee: Okay, I think I have done, uhm, I have helped them a lot with their English. I'm
fortunate to have had these children from first grade, and since I work at an adjacent middle
school, all the way to ninth grade, middle school. So, I've seen them, you know, their, their
English abilities. Some of them do not go to private school. So, I've seen them, you know,
they're talking, they're communicating. So, I think I've done a good job.
Interviewer: And you're interested in the field of education and teaching?
Ashlee: Correct. I'm currently studying for my Master's in Teaching Elementary Education.
Interviewer: And before your master's, were you interested in teaching and education?
Ashlee: Yeah, so I do have a Teaching Elementary Education certificate, uhm, that I got a few
years ago. And I've actually always wanted to be a teacher, but I didn't follow that path in
university.
Interviewer: And how do you think the subject English is perceived by colleagues and
superiors at your school?
Ashlee: Uhm, so I know a lot of my teachers are, some of them are shy to speak, but I have
noticed over the years, uhm, just talking to me, a lot of them, that's helped them with their
confidence. And they talk, and they, when I'm around them, they try to speak in English.
Interviewer: And how do you think students perceive English?
Ashlee: So, some students, it's definitely not their favorite class. They prefer PE, but they do
enjoy it, especially when we have games. So, then they say, okay, they like English then.
Only when there's games or they're moving, being more physical, not studying part. They
want to do all the games and activities that we do in English.
Interviewer: And does the way that students perceive English positively or negatively affect
you emotionally?
Ashlee: Uhm, so when a student is having an off day, let's say they're not enjoying the
lesson, or they're just not getting it. They get sad or they're, you know, they get angry or
upset. And so, I'm just like, “Okay, I don't know how to, how can I help you?” You know,
“How can I change, how can I change the lesson a little bit better for you?” Yeah, it kind of
does affect me, but not as much as, like, my first early years of teaching.
Interviewer: Could you elaborate more about how it affects you in terms of, maybe you
clench your fist or breathing, or you have to give yourself a time out?
Ashlee: Uhm, so, like, let's say if a student, (pause) they just maybe throw a temper tantrum
in school or in class that day because they just- I don’t know, they couldn't get it. I've had a
couple of students who are like that. They just couldn't grasp the lesson or other students
were making fun of them because they weren't able to pronounce something correctly. So,
they shut down. And so, then I'm probably, uhm, maybe I'm gonna get, like, a headache or
something and be like, okay, all right. Then I'd have to probably just rest for maybe 20
minutes until, you know, take a Tylenol or something.
Interviewer: So, it affects you physically?
Ashlee: Arguing. Yeah. Especially because they’re arguing.
Interviewer: And when do you feel frustrated at work?
Ashlee: Hmm, I would say my most, most of my frustration might come (pause), uh, let's say
when, uhm, we call them Korean surprises, for example. So, when, in the beginning, I
would say the beginning was when, uhm, (coughs) my first couple of years teaching public
school, and I wouldn't know that there was an assembly or something. So, I'd be waiting for
the students to come, I would probably have had an entire lesson planned, and they never
show up. And then I'd come to find that, oh, they had an assembly that I wasn't aware of. So,
that would make me frustrated.
Interviewer: And as you're explaining now the scenario, do you maybe perhaps feel
sentiments of, like, exclusion as well?
Ashlee: Uhm so, my school has gotten a little bit better at that, and are letting me know
what's going on. So, now I have, like, the full calendar of the activities for the month that's
going on. So, I don't feel as excluded anymore.
Interviewer: And how do you deal with frustration at work?
Ashlee: Uhm, do you mean, like, from the students or from, in general?
Interviewer: From, in your work environment. So, from students, from colleagues- relating
to your work environment.
Ashlee: Okay. So, like, how I deal with frustration?
Interviewer: Yes. If it's coming, well, frustration is coming, well, generated from a student or
maybe a colleague at work or a co-teacher or management or even the subject English in
general; how you teach.
Ashlee: Okay. So, when that happens and I start feeling really frustrated, I would just sit
down and put on my headphones, listen to, like, some jazz music or something soothing like
that, and then just take a couple deep breaths or something. Just to reconfigure myself,
yeah.
Interviewer: What would you consider an ideal work environment?
Ashlee: An ideal work environment?
Interviewer: Yes, in your opinion.
Ashlee: Ideally (pause), okay, so, like, in Korean schools, you know, we have to do this thing
called desk warming to make our 40 hours. We're sometimes stuck at work even when we
are completely finished. Ideally, I think, I prefer that when we are finished, there's no more
classes to teach, you can go home. So, like, today, for example, Thursdays, I finish all my
lessons at 2.30, but I had to stay till 4.30. But I'm already planned all my lessons and
everything like that, so I'm just sitting there. So, ideally, I would say a good work
environment is, like, when you're done, you're done, go home.
Interviewer: And what do you usually do in that free time?
Ashlee: So, if I'm not studying, then I, as I said, make a lesson plan if I have for the next class,
making photocopies and so forth.
Interviewer: And what would you consider a bad day at work?
Ashlee: Bad day, ugh, okay (chuckles), let's say when, you know, like, technology is not
working, you know, the TV- I've had instances when the Wi-Fi was down in the entire
building, couldn't do the lessons I had prepared. Uhm, students were not cooperating
because, you know, they wanted to do, let's say, one of the games on, one of the activities
from online, I couldn't do that with them. So, stuff like that. I would say that's a bad day
(chuckles) when, like, nothing's working for you.
Interviewer: And when you're having a bad day at work, how does it impact your teaching
capabilities or classroom environment?
Ashlee: So, I do have to change stuff up a bit and I have to go back old school techniques. So,
just book and pencil or, you know, find whatever I have in a classroom that I can use other
manipulatives to, uh, help the students, to reach the students. So, yeah, that's how it
impacts me. That's why I go old school.
Interviewer: And when you are having a good day at work, how does it impact your teaching
capabilities or classroom environments?
Ashlee: So, when I'm having a good day; this is actually something that happened maybe
two or three years ago. And to me, I was doing a regular lesson, but I guess my personality,
my energy level was high up or something. And a student who seldom really participates
much in class goes, “Wow, teacher, lots of energy today”. And that made me feel happy,
you know, that, you know, my happiness was transferred to them.
Interviewer: And what have you had to adopt or change about yourself to conform to
Korean standards or expectations in the classroom? If so, please explain.
Ashlee: Hmm, oh, I've had to slow down my speaking because I'm naturally fast, obviously,
native speaker. So, I've had to slow that down a bit, even for- not just the children but for
the adults as well. And I had to make, make my words, you know, the definition smaller. So,
was in English or how to describe it, you know, do my definition and so forth, to make it
easier for them to understand.
Interviewer: And is this for work colleagues and students?
Ashlee: Both, yeah.
Interviewer: And when do you suppress unpleasant feelings in the classroom, in the work
environment?
Ashlee: Uhm, I'm more like an open book so it’s hard to suppress (chuckles). But when it
comes to that, uh, (pause) I would say that a few years ago, I had a colleague who just
didn't understand social cues and like not to do or say stuff. Uhm so, like, you know, I have
like braids or something in my hair and she would just go and just start touching my hair
without my permission. Uhm, and that's just a very Korean thing, you know. So, in a
situation like that, I have to sort of—not to seem culturally insensitive. I just have to like
move my body around her, you know, grab my hair so she can't touch it or something like
that. So, that's how I have to like suppress, I guess.
Interviewer: And relating to that question, so you usually will suppress unpleasant feelings
when it's got to do with work colleagues?
Ashlee: Yeah.
Interviewer: Maybe the rules of management and work environment—
Ashlee: Cultural experience or expectations.
Interviewer: So, while she was playing with your braids or something like that, you felt you
couldn't maybe confront her in the work environment—
Ashlee: Yeah, yeah.
Interviewer: Because it could cause maybe a bigger scene?
Ashlee: Yeah.
Interviewer: And how do you react to unpleasant feelings?
Ashlee: Uhm, you mean in general or just for that situation with that teacher?
Interviewer: When, well, as you said, you have these unpleasant feelings when it's got to do
with work colleagues. So, how do you react to those feelings that you're having?—
Ashlee: So, it's annoying.
Interviewer: It might be physically, or might you have to clear your mind or give time to
yourself?
Ashlee: Well, when that happens, you know, I would just, uhm, remove myself from the
something like that; just to remove myself in that situation. So, I don't react.
Interviewer: And how do you mitigate unpleasant feelings? Like to try and stop yourself
from having these feelings?
Ashlee: Uhm, (pause) deep breath (laughs) and just think to myself, okay, different culture.
She's older, you know, so I think she's like 60 or something at the time. So, I'd be like, oh,
she's older, different culture. And I just like try to see myself in that position and then just
think, okay, back off, don't go full-fledged South Florida on these people here, for example.
Interviewer: So, it's got to do with the rules of management or work environment?
Ashlee: Yeah.
Interviewer: And what is the impact of suppressing those, these unpleasant feelings at
work? Does it impact you in any way?
Ashlee: Uhm, no, no, it doesn't really impact me because it just becomes something like a
story I can tell someone like later on and be like, “Oh, you want to hear a crazy story?” you
know, “This is what I had to deal with some co-workers back in the past.” Uhm, so I try not
to let it get to me anymore. And I try to like evolve from that, mental state. And then I
actually, back to that lady who used to touch my hair, I actually ended up getting a t-shirt
written in Korean that says, Please don't touch my hair. And I would wear it to school, and
then it becomes like sort of a cultural lesson to the adults as well. And then they're like, “Oh,
why can't we touch it?” And I'm just like, “Oh, because, you know, A, it's a lot of money and
B, it's just a personal space thing.” And then they understand it. So, it kind of teaches them.
Interviewer: Because as you said, you said that uhm, you don't let it get to you anymore. So,
before, did it get to you?
Ashlee: Yeah, like I said, I would get annoyed. So, yeah, I would get annoyed with that and
just, especially when I was younger and be like, oh, you know, why are they acting this way,
you know?
Interviewer: And do you see yourself as resilient towards emotion or vulnerable?
Ashlee: I would say resilient. Yeah, I'd say resilient.
Interviewer: And what cultural differences have impacted your well-being in the workplace?
Ashlee: Uhm, yeah, as I said, that difference was like with that teacher, you know, don't
touch me, don't, uh, come into my personal space, which is something that's different here
in this country. Uhm, they're very close-knit in a way, especially this school I work at. We
have a lot of siblings, sibling groups. So, they all act like siblings (chuckles). So, yeah, I think
that's something that I've had to like mi- yeah, mitigate.
Interviewer: So, cultural sensitivity?
Ashlee: Yeah.
Interviewer: And you said that you see yourself resilient towards emotion. Can you
elaborate on that? How do you remain resilient when you're having these unpleasant
feelings?
Ashlee: Um, okay, so let's say if a student is acting up or something, I have to think of it that
I'm the adult, I'm older, you know, they're still kids, they're still kind of process feelings,
emotions and so forth. So, I should know better. And so, that's like how I try and think of
that situation. That's what I mean by resilient.
Interviewer: And do you think that you're treated fairly at work? If not, how does it
influence your teaching and behavior at work?
Ashlee: Um, yeah, I think I'm treated pretty fairly. Uhm, you know, I've heard a lot of horror
stories from other teachers. We have like a Kakao teacher chat group, for example. And, you
know, I would say my school does, they help me out a lot. Uhm, when I had an issue with
my old housing situation and I was ready to just leave Korea, they worked really hard to try
and find me a suit- suitable housing so that I can bring my pets with me, for example. So, I
think they, they treat me pretty fairly, yeah. And they give me a lot of respect for, uhm, that,
I think.
Interviewer: So, the work environment with your principal and colleagues, you would
consider it to be quite good?
Ashlee: I would say, yeah. It, it actually, it just depends on who is in charge, who is the
principal in charge, because it really goes from top down. If there's a principal that gets on
everyone's nerves, you can feel that tension. And we've had a principal like that in the past.
But then when she left, everyone else, they became more open and less, they didn't feel as,
uh, stressed out. You can see the stress on people, you know? She had a lot of demands.
Interviewer: And do you consider yourself to be part of a team with staff at school?—
Ashlee: Yeah,
Interviewer: If not, do you make any attempts to fit in with colleagues?
Ashlee: Yeah, yeah. So, they do try, uhm, to invite me to places. Uhm, so I've gone to a
couple of the Hweshiks with them. But because of the schedule and, you know, we all live
different places; some live in Jinju, some live in Daegu. It's really hard to get anything sorted
together. But, you know, when we have school events, they do try to invite me to come
along with them. Like, they had Sports Day a few weeks ago. I couldn't do it because I had to
do my medical, but they had wanted me there as well. But I was like,” I can't, have to do my
medical.” So, they do try to involve me.
Interviewer: I think we've reached the end of the interview.
Ashlee: Oh, wow. Okay, that's great.
Participant 6: Sammy
Interviewer: Thank you for participating in the interview. You can withdraw consent at any
time, or you can skip to the next question if you feel uncomfortable. So, could you briefly
tell me where you are from and for how long you have been teaching at your current
school?
Sammy: I am from South Africa, and I have been teaching at my current school for one
month.
Interviewer: Have you had any teaching experience prior to teaching at your current school?
Sammy: No.
Interviewer: So, this is your first-time teaching?
Sammy: Correct, yes.
Interviewer: And why were you interested in applying to teach in a public school in South
Korea?
Sammy: I've always wanted to teach at a school since 2019 but then COVID hit, the COVID
pandemic hit and then I was unable to pursue my dream of teaching overseas abroad. At
first, I wanted to do it in China and then I did further research and I gained more positive
pros than cons of teaching in South Korea, uh, compared to teaching in China.
Interviewer: And where did this interest in teaching come from, the root of it?
Sammy: Oh, so when I was young, I've always babysat like people's kids like on weekends.
Uhm, so I did it like, as a side like as a side job. So, people would pay me to take care of their
kids. So that's where my love for children began. And then my sisters also had kids and then
I practically raised them by the time that I was still in South Africa. I raised my sister's kids so
I thought maybe teaching would be fit for me because I was good with children. If that
makes sense.
Interviewer: And what is your relationship with your co-teacher like?
Sammy: My relationship with my co-teacher? So, with my co-teacher, I don't teach with her
on a daily basis. So, she is a Grade 4 homeroom teacher and I only get Grade 4’s on a Friday.
Uhm, my relationship with her is very professional. I must say, I'm still getting to know her,
and I haven't been teaching for a long time with her if that makes sense. So, I'm still building
that relationship with her.
Interviewer: So, your co-teacher isn’t necessarily the homeroom teacher in each class. They
are acting as your co-teacher in the classroom?
Sammy: Yes, correct.
Interviewer: And what is your relationship like then with the homeroom teacher?
Sammy: Okay, so homeroom teachers, some of them are, some of them, uhm, take charge,
like to take charge majority of th-the lesson. And then some of them, which are younger
teachers, so teachers that are older would like to take more charge in controlling the
classroom. And what I mean by older teachers, those are teachers with probably like 20
years plus teaching experience. So, they are more hands-on, and they like to take control of
like the classroom and the lesson while teaching. And then the younger teachers who have
less than 10 years teaching experience, uhm, they are able to give me room to actually
teach the class. And actually, they step in if they see probably the students don't understand
the instruction in English. And then they would step in. And other instances they would step
in is when I give, uhm, the students a task to do. And then we'd work hand in hand in trying
to help the students that are struggling with the work.
Interviewer: And what is your role in the classroom when it comes to the older teachers or
more experienced teachers?
Sammy: So, my role in the classroom is to actually reiterate or to repeat like the instruction
in English. It's either they instruct the learners in Korean and I do it in English or vice versa,
where I will instruct the learners and they would, uhm, explain it in Korean.
Interviewer: Is it more like the parrot style of learning where you have to repeat the word
and then they listen and repeat?
Sammy: Yes.
Interviewer: And with the younger co-teachers, what is your role in the classroom then?
Sammy: So, my role with-within the classroom is I actually teach a lesson according to the
curriculum, and they would actually step in if they see that maybe there is confusion or
maybe there are learners that the level of English is not what the same with the other kids,
then they would step in and assist.
Interviewer: And what is the classroom dynamic like teaching with your co-teacher? I think
we touched on that a bit now but if you could elaborate more what is the classroom
dynamic like teaching with the homeroom teachers?
Sammy: What do you mean by dynamics? Can you elaborate?
Interviewer: The classroom dynamic for example, the older teacher will do the listen and
repeat, and then you would have to read it and the students repeat, and then the game for
example they will explain in Korean and then you will explain it in English. It's more of like
feeding off each other but parrot style, or for example the classroom dynamic with the
younger teacher is that they will be at the back, and you are the main teacher; you take the
initiative as a teacher. You instruct students and they are more there just for supervision.
Sammy: So, with the younger teachers I could say 50 percent are there for supervision and
the other 50 percent are there to actually work hand- in- hand with me. And then with the
older teachers, who have much more teaching experience, like 20 years, plus it's more of a
parrot style. I've asked this as to why and then the response I've received from one of the
teachers that has had 20 years plus teaching experience was that the, the level of English of
the students it's so low that they have to we, have to balance teaching in Korean as well as
English translating it in English or translating English into Korean sorry.
Interviewer: And would you consider yourself to be an English teacher or a teacher
assistant?
Sammy: Majority of the time an English teacher.
Interviewer: And why would you consider yourself to be an English teacher?
Sammy: Uhm, I'd consider myself to be an English teacher because I actually planned for my
lessons that are in the curriculum. And then also with the planning; so, I would plan the
actual lesson that I will be teaching and how I will be teaching the lesson. As well as
planning the games or activities for the children and carrying it out on the lesson with the
students.
Interviewer: And can you describe your usual daily routine at work?
Sammy: Uhm, from the morning to when I leave?
Interviewer: Yes.
Sammy: So, in the morning I come to school and then I have 20 minutes before my first
lesson begins. So, if I, if my first lesson begins at nine, so I have 20 minutes to actually, uhm,
prepare, uh, like: switch on my computer, switch on the screen, make sure that the sound is
working, uhm, any materials that I might need, put up posters if I need to put up posters for
the lesson prior. Uhm, any materials that they might need if we're going to do an activity
that needs materials or supplies like glue, paper, pens, get that ready and then I'll carry on
when it's time to teach. I invite my students into the classroom and then I teach my lessons.
Uhm, so I teach about four to five lessons a day, so that equates to, uhm, 22 hours of
teaching time in a week. Uhm, so once I've taught maybe like four to five lessons in a day,
uhm, the balance of the day I use to plan for my other classes or upcoming classes.
Interviewer: And when it comes to decision making regarding the English curriculum test or
lesson planning, are you actively involved?
Sammy: So, with the lesson planning for — so I teach Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, Grade 4,
Grade 5, not Grade 1, sorry, I teach Grade 3, Grade 4, Grade 5, Grade 6. Uhm, so with Grade
3, Grade 5, and Grade 6, I do the planning myself, all the planning I do that for the lesson.
And with Grade 4 because it's more experienced teachers with 20 plus years of teaching
experience, uhm, I am guided through how to teach the lesson for the kids, for the children.
Interviewer: And do you think that you have contributed positively to the end goal of
enhanced English communication among students in the classroom? If yes, how so?
Sammy: I think I have contributed positively, because uhm, most Korean teachers when
they teach English; what I've observed is that they use materials that is readily available
which is the textbook, the teacher's guide, and as well as the audio, uhm, to actually teach
the lesson. Uhm, and I want to emphasize on the audio because, uh, since they are not
native English speakers or teachers, uhm, many of the teachers are not confident in the
pronunciation, or in constructing sentences, or explaining the lesson to the learners in
English. So, they rely on audio and visuals for the learners’ majority of the time. So, as for
me, I actually read, uh, to the learners, give instructions to the learners using my own voice
so that the students can also pick up that, they don't actually have to say it in that particular
accent that they hear from the audio book, and they can pick up from my accent.
Interviewer: And what is the accent of the audio book?
Sammy: So, the accent of the audio book is westernized by the– so by westernized I mean
it's American, it's the American accent.
Interviewer: And do you feel like there is a heavy influence of American culture and the
accent?
Sammy:I think there is a big influence because the English curriculum at the school is taught
in American English. By American English the audios are in an American accent, the spelling
of words are in American. So, American spelling, uhm, applies and the pronunciation of
words or construction of sentences is done in the American accent.
Interviewer: And so how does this make you feel as a South African? When you see
everything is American, then do you feel any sort of pressure or how does it make you feel
in the classroom?
Sammy: Currently, I don't feel any kind of pressure because, uh, the homeroom teachers
have motivated me to speak more with the learners as to, uh, relying on the audio that is
the American accent. So, I am supported to use my accent or to speak in my accent as much
as possible with the students.
Interviewer: And how do you think the subject English is perceived by colleagues and
superiors at your school?
Sammy: Uhm, (pause) I'm not exactly sure because we've never had that conversation with
my colleagues.
Interviewer: How do you think students perceive English?
Sammy: So, there is a balance, I think. So, you get students that think English is just a
classroom where we play games, and you get students that actually are interested in
learning the language.
Interviewer: So, do you think students perceive English, uhm mixed? Some see it as just a
class for games and some see it as, oh, this is actually where we are going to learn?
Sammy: Yes.
Interviewer: And does the way that students perceive English either positively or negatively,
affect you emotionally?
Sammy: Sorry, no it doesn't affect me negatively because I feel like I'm able to, uhm, I’m
able to teach on both ends. Like, I'm able to balance it out in terms of, I will teach what's in
the textbook and then provide time on when the students will play an educational game,
that relates to the topic. So, I balance it out to keep both students or both groups of
students interested in learning the subject or the language.
Interviewer: So, if a student had to say a harsh remark about English, would it affect you
emotionally or no?
Sammy: I don't think it would, as much as I'm a native English teacher. It wouldn't because I
understand probably, they're young and they still have a lot to learn about, maybe different
languages, cultures, and about the world in general. So, I think as time progresses, they will
have the knowledge to understand that there's more out there besides, uh, the Korean
culture and the Korean language.
Interviewer: And when do you feel frustrated at work?
Sammy: Oh, when do I feel frustrated? I think I feel more frustrated when, uhm, I especially
with the teachers that have more teaching experience. Uhm, English, the English lesson is
carried out majority of the time in the Korean language as opposed to the EL, which I feel
limits the opportunity for the students to actually learn the language.
Interviewer: So, do you feel like the English classes are actually focused on communication
then?
Sammy: Uhm, yes. So, it's focused on communication and knowing how to actually write in
English. So, there's a balance. So, I'd say 50-50.
Interviewer: And how do you deal with frustration at work?
Sammy: So, I've, I will have conversations with maybe the homeroom teacher on how we
can balance it out, but it's not always easy, as I'm a new teacher coming in. And they have
had experience in teaching for a number of years, and also the culture is different. So, they
might see it fit as Korean, as a Korean teacher to teach students in Korean for better
understanding.
Interviewer: And what would you consider an ideal work environment?
Sammy: An ideal working environment would be an environment that is professional, and
an environment where you are able to do the work that you are hired to do, which is in my
case teaching English.
Interviewer: You spoke about the frustration that you feel when you're trying to balance the
lesson. The frustration that you feel, do you maybe feel that because you're speaking to
somebody with like so many years of experience, that maybe you feel a bit small or
something like that?
Sammy: Uhm (pause) not small. I wouldn't say I feel small but there's a frustration on them
not understanding what we are trying to achieve, which, is, uh, for the students to be able
to actually communicate in the EL and to be able to understand the language, and to be able
to write in the language.
Interviewer: So, you feel like the end goal of the class differs?
Sammy: It does differ because, uh (pause) it does differ because maybe the game's part of
the lesson is, the game's part of the lesson, that's why students think maybe English is the
game, is a game class instead of a learning class. Because maybe, uhm, some teachers
emphasize the game part as opposed to the learning part of teaching.
Interviewer: And what would you consider a good day at work?
Sammy: So, a good day at work for me is if I had a plan to teach an actual lesson and to
carry out that lesson to its fullest potential, like having a plan, lesson plan, teaching the
lesson plan to the kids and having the students understand the lesson and interacting while
I teach the lesson. So, I consider it to be a good day because I perceive it as that the learners
have, the students have learned something that day.
Interviewer: The successful execution of a lesson plan.
Sammy: Yes, yes.
Interviewer: And what would you consider a bad day at work?
Sammy: I would say a bad day at work would be challenges that I experience with getting
like, communicating with the students because I teach, uhm, a big group of students in a
classroom. So, it's not, uhm, it's not the same as in many schools because many schools in
Korea have very small classes and I deal with the big class. And sometimes the, the students
are rowdy and it's very difficult to get students to actually concentrate on the actual lesson
being taught.
Interviewer: And what are some of the techniques that you try to implement to deal with
discipline?
Sammy: So, when I arrived at the school, uhm, so my co-teacher; so the teacher that helps
me around with getting settled in Korea, getting my foreigner card, getting my bank card ,so
we've had a discussion about discipline and I was told— so we've had a discussion about
discipline but I did not bring up the conversation, so I was told that I am not allowed to
discipline students. So, in a way that I'm not allowed to correct students or to intervene in
any way or form. So, I have to go through the homeroom teacher in order to make sure that
the student, uhm, misbehaving is being disciplined. So, I go to the homeroom teacher and
the homeroom teacher deals with the situation.
Interviewer: And this would be the case, if the homeroom teacher is not present in the
classroom?
Sammy: So, I would actually communicate it with the student and say that, “If you don't
listen, then I will report you to the homeroom teacher.”
Interviewer: Okay and in this case, is there no Korean teacher in the classroom?
Sammy: So, there was an incident where there was no homeroom teacher in the classroom,
uhm, in this week for the first time. And that happened where a student was misbehaving
and I had to use a translation app, so that the student would understand that if he does not
stop misbehaving, he would be reported.
Interviewer: And when you're having a bad day at work how does it impact your teaching
capabilities or classroom environment?
Sammy: So, I don't think I've had a bad day that would actually, uhm, have a negative
impact on the way that I actually teach, because I try to not take anything personal.
Interviewer: And when you are having a good day at work how does it impact your teaching
capabilities or classroom environment?
Sammy: So, I'm able to create an environment that is fun and that is more informative on
the lesson that I'm teaching for the students, and I'm able to, uhm, get through the
curriculum as quickly as possible. So, that I can afford the students to play a game or to have
fun, so I reward, uhm, students for being well-behaved.
Interviewer: So, your emotion feeds off on the students?
Sammy: Yes.
Interviewer: Do you think that’s correct?
Sammy: Yes, yes.
Interviewer: And what have you had to adopt or change about yourself to conform to
Korean standards or expectations in the classroom?
Sammy: Uhm, I think one of the things that I've had to learn, I don't think it (pause) has to
do with the Korean standards for me, but one of the things that I've had to learn is patience
when dealing with children, if that makes sense. So, I have to have the patience of, uhm,
explaining the work to the students, having to have patience, uhm, waiting for the students
that haven't completed the task at hand, uhm, to complete it before we move on to the, uh,
next section of the lesson.
Interviewer: And do you think that uhm, “patience” that you've mentioned is because you
have pressure put on being patient, because it's a second language and it's not their first
language?
Sammy: Correct.
Interviewer: And when do you suppress unpleasant feelings?
Sammy: When do I suppress an unpleasant feeling?
Interviewer: Yes, unpleasant feelings that you may experience in the classroom.
Sammy: Oh, so the thing about patience, it's not that I'm, I’m very agitated but then I have,
uhm, I have to bring my mind back and think what if I was in the student's shoes, how would
I feel?, how would I want the teacher to conduct the lesson?, how would I want the teacher
to be patient with me? because the teacher can see that I am trying my best as a student.
Interviewer: And how do you react to unpleasant feelings?
Sammy: What do you mean by an unpleasant feeling?
Interviewer: Unpleasant feelings for like for example feelings of annoyance, frustration or
anger. And you have this feeling and then you think okay, I cannot act like this because you
have to act in a professional manner, so I try and suppress it by perhaps focusing on
something else or like clenching my fist.
Sammy: Oh no, so when I go to work, I think like that applies to even, uhm, that applies to
even, uhm, when I even started teaching. So, for me when I go into a work environment, I
try not to have, uhm, any negative feelings that would lead me to feelings of anger, agitated
or being agitated because then in my mind I've already programmed myself into thinking
that you are at work, be professional, don't take anything personally, uhm, because at the
end of the day the people that I'm working with are not family or they are not friends. So, I
wouldn't want them to, uhm, to bring up any negative feeling that would make it ruin my
day, if that makes sense.
Interviewer: So, you prepare yourself mentally?
Sammy: Yes.
Interviewer: For going into the work environment, and conforming to like the rules of a
work environment where you keep things professional?
Sammy: Correct.
Interviewer: And what is the impact of suppressing these unpleasant feelings at work? Do
you think that there is an impact?
Sammy: I don't think there's a negative or positive impact because I've had, uhm, work
experience in a professional environment, even though it was not teaching prior to this, and
I've worked in that industry for six years. Uhm, so I try not to take any kind of feelings
negative feelings back home, if that makes sense.
Interviewer: And what is the benefit of suppressing your feelings at work?
Sammy: So, the benefits of suppressing my feelings at work is that I'm able to, to move on
from things very quickly, and carry on with my day. So, I don't leave any negative things that
have been said, I don't leave it to linger on me or on my life.
Interviewer: And do you see yourself as resilient towards emotion or vulnerable?
Sammy: In the workplace, I think resilient.
Interviewer: Is this due to the, uhm, work rules of the work environment?
Sammy: (pause) It could be because of the rules of the work environment, but it's up to the
individual to decide what impacts them emotionally.
Interviewer: And what cultural differences have impacted your well-being in the workplace?
Sammy: So, there aren't any major— there aren't any cultural differences that are have
impacted my, my work on a daily basis or me being in Korea. Because I feel like the (pause),
I feel like the rules in the workplace are actually rules that are normal, that would apply in
any other country if that makes sense.
Interviewer: And do you think that you're treated fairly at work? And if not, how does it
influence your teaching and behavior at work?
Sammy: Currently, I do think that I'm treated fairly.
Interviewer: And do you consider yourself to be part of a team with staff at school? If not do
you make any attempts to fit in with colleagues?
Sammy: I wouldn't say in my workplace there is like an actual team. Uh, but I am able
because like everyone does their own thing at work, so everyone keeps to themselves the
majority of the time. Uh, but for instances where these interactions in groups and people at
the workplace like, for example with volleyball, uhm, so I am encouraged to join the
volleyball team on days that I can't play due to my wrist injury. Uhm, I am encouraged to
come and watch and to like, feel like I'm part of the team. And then also besides when it's
like volleyball, during lunch times at the cafeteria there are like groups of teachers', Korean
teachers that would come and have conversations with me in the— like when we're sitting
and eating our lunch, during lunch time, I guess.
Interviewer: Thank you, we've reached the end of the interview. Do you have any questions
for me?
Sammy: Currently, no I do not have any questions.
Participant 7: James
Interviewer: Okay, you can withdraw your consent at any time, and you may skip to the next
question if you wish. So, could you briefly tell me where you are from and for how long you
have been teaching at your current school?
James: I am from Cape Town; South Africa and I've been teaching at my, uh, current school
for three years.
Interviewer: And you work at a public rural elementary school?
James: Yes, I do.
Interviewer: And have you had any teaching experience prior to teaching at your current
school?
James: Yes, I taught at a middle school in the same, uh, city for five years.
Interviewer: And was this at a public school?
James: Yes.
Interviewer: And why were you interested in applying to teach in a public school in South
Korea?
James: Uh, public schools, uhm, the contract is more binding than it is working at a Hagwon.
So, your contract, it just stands longer. Hagwons are businesses, public schools are
education centers. So, uhm, that's the main difference, is a Hagwon is going to be run like a
business, a public school is going to be run like a school. And therefore, also my contract, it
holds up. I can bring my contract; I can show them. I heard a lot of horror stories about
Hagwons, about people not being paid on time and that kind of thing and just not being
treated well. And being very disposable. So, like if you're sick or something happens, they're
easy to fire you. Where I can go with my contract and be like to my public school, hey, look,
it says in the contract I did nothing wrong. And yeah, they're a lot more, it's a lot more
humanized, you're not just labor.
Interviewer: And what is your relationship like with your current co-teacher?
James: Uh, my relationship is very good, very kind. Yeah, just we talk. We haven't got a deep
personal bond or anything like that, but it's very nice. It's friendly. It's perfect. She's helpful.
She's kind. Everything is perfect.
Interviewer: And what is your role in the classroom?
James: My role in the classroom is to encourage students to speak as much English as
possible and help build them their confidence, while speaking English.
Interviewer: So, your focus is on communication?
James: Yes.
Interviewer: And how do you teach communication? Is it through reading? Is it through
listening and repeating?
James: Uh, listening and repeating and then cultivating exercises, which allow them to also
use, uhm, their own thinking to speak English. Because listening, I, I find when I do a lot of
listen and repeat, they're just waiting to listen and repeat. And then they (chuckles), when
it's later on, when you try to have a conversation with them, they don't know what's going
on because they're just parroting. They're not, yeah, learning properly. They just listen and
repeat.
Interviewer: So, what is your pedagogy in enhancing communication?
James: Could you please define pedagogy to me?
Interviewer: Pedagogy is how you teach, how you convey meaning, how you teach learners,
the strategies you use, the concepts, the teaching concepts that you use.
James: Mostly with a lot of visual aids. So, they’ll know like they can associate a picture or
video to the conversation or, or grammar that they're learning.
Interviewer: And what is the classroom dynamic like teaching with your co-teacher?
James: It's very good. Uhm, I teach and if they really don't understand, she comes in and
explains to them in Korean and then they get a better understanding. So, yeah, it's very
good. They, I do most of the teaching and then they do most of either helping those who
are—really don't understand or they also do the disciplinary role.
Interviewer: So, your teacher is actively involved in your class?
James: Yes.
Interviewer: And would you consider yourself to be an English teacher or a teacher
assistant?
James: An English teacher.
Interviewer: If so, why would you consider yourself to be an English teacher and not a
teacher assistant?
James: Because I take command of the classroom when teaching my English. I don't assist,
it’s not—I'm the leader. Then the role reverses with my co-teacher. My co-teacher becomes
a teaching assistant, I teach and then they assist. But I'm governing the classroom, I set the
activities and everything for the day and what we're going to do. So, yeah, so I do feel like
I'm a teacher.
Interviewer: Can you describe your usual daily routine at work?
James: Uhm, my daily routine? (pause) I usually get to work around 40 minutes to an hour
early before we start, and then I prepare all my lessons. Uhm, and then I relax a little bit,
you know, calm the mind, have some casual conversation with other colleagues when they
walk in, have a cup of coffee and then I go teach my first lesson. And then, uhm yeah, I'll
usually teach around three or four lessons in a row, lunchtime and then one or two, and
then I'm finished. I teach around five lessons a day.
Interviewer: And when it comes to decision making regarding the English curriculum, test or
lesson planning, are you actively involved?
James: I'm actively involved in my lesson planning and what I plan for the lesson, yeah. I-I
I'm not involved in test making, but I am involved in setting out my lesson plan and what I
want to teach in my class. I have that freedom. They don’t—like I have a textbook and then I
must cultivate my own curriculum around those chapters.
Interviewer: And do you think that you have contributed positively to the end goal of
enhanced English communication among students in the classroom? If yes, how so?
James: Yes, because I can see it because I've been teaching them for, I teach them for
multiple years. So, I can see how they've improved and how they, I can see how they change
from how shy they are in the beginning and then how much more confident they become
speaking English. Uhm, I get voted quite a lot as like the favorite class when it comes to like
the end of year, like, what's your favorite class? A lot of students vote that English is their
favorite class because of me. Uhm, on teacher's day, I got given around 20 letters thanking
me and telling me how much I enjoy English. And this is not forced by the teacher.
Otherwise, I would have gotten, you know, a whole bunch from every class. They’re literally
told like, go give your favorite teacher a, a card if you want. And I got around like 20 cards.
Interviewer: And how do you think the subject English is perceived by colleagues and
superiors at your school?
James: They're very jealous. They always tell me they're very jealous I can speak English
because speaking English, uh, provides a lot of opportunity.
Interviewer: And as a subject English at school?
James: Uh, as a subject English?
Interviewer: You get, uhm, an amount of like respect towards your subject?
James: Definitely, like teachers come and tell me the whole time like, “Wow, James, how do
you make your classes so fun? How do you make them so interactive?” I get a lot of
compliments from other teachers regarding my, uhm, English lessons. And then they have
to teach the grammar section of the English class, and they're always asking me for help to
like, you know, help them make their lessons better or tips or something like that. Or they'll
tell me like, “Wow, you do it so well”. So yeah.
Interviewer: So you will focus on the communication section and your, the English teacher
will focus on the grammar section?
James: Yes.
Interviewer: And does this happen in one lesson that you do communication, and the
English teacher teaches grammar or are those two separate lessons?
James: Those are two separate lessons. So, I have my English class and they have their
English class that they teach.
Interviewer: And how do you think students perceive English?
James: Uh, it varies on their level. Some really love it and think it's really fun, and then some
are just like, it's too difficult. And that's because in the foundation phase, they really didn't
pay attention. And then, you know, when you barely know your ABCs, when we're learning
sentences, it's hard to catch up. So, I can see how your passion for the language is really low.
But they love like English movies. They love English songs. So, they are, they are part of like
the Western culture. They really enjoy.
Interviewer: And does the way that students perceive English positively or negatively affect
you emotionally?
James: Uhm, (pause) No, no, no, not really. What affects me emotionally is just the behav—
the, the the, the disrespect sometimes, I would say, affects me emotionally. And you have
to remember, they're just children, you don't know what goes on in their home life or this or
that, why they're acting out today. But like, you know, that kind of thing, just like (pause).
Yeah, just the lack of discipline being enforced in the classroom, because it's very difficult to
enforce discipline in the classroom these days. Because of, uhm, you know, making sure you
don't hurt their feelings, and there's certain ways to talk with, you know, these new studies,
and everything is very different from when we grew up. Like you have to watch out for the
child's emotions and these kinds of things. So, uhm, they don't really learn when something
is bad because at the end of the day, they'll do something bad and then they'll get like a hug.
And like they'll get— and you never know what if they're not getting hugs at home. So, like
then I'm going to be the naughtiest child because my teacher is going to tell me that's wrong
and give me a hug. So, I think it's the discipline aspect.
Interviewer: And when do you feel frustrated at work?
James: Uh, when do I feel frustrated at work? When I see students bullying other students
and then there's nothing much you can do about it. Oh yeah, it's just that makes me feel
really frustrated. Uh, I also feel frustrated just that the, sheer amount of how big the classes
are. So, they're very noisy and loud and it's hard to calm down 25-30 students. Uhm, to like
calm down and then the co-teacher who's teaching with me will like raise their voice, and
yeah. I think it’s— that does make me feel, just frustrated is the sound pollution.
Interviewer: And how do you deal with frustration at work?
James: Uhm, in my free time, I just go and I sit down on like; we have like a small little
recliner that's like hidden off, and I'll just lay there and calm my mind for a little bit. And
yeah, that's it.
Interviewer: And what would you consider an ideal work environment?
James: Uh, an ideal environment would be smaller classes. I don't think proper education
can happen with 25-30 different students and then, they're all at different levels. So, it's
very difficult to give individual attention. So, I think smaller classes with around like 12 to 15
students would be better. And then you can give everyone like, the same amount of
attention and help them.
Interviewer: So do you feel that because you have such a big class, you're not able to give
100% of yourself to each student?
James: Yeah, of course. I don't think you can.
Interviewer: And what would you consider a good day at work?
James: A good day at work, uh when students are very engaged in the lesson, and it runs
smoothly. And yeah, that's all. And they're very engaged, understand, have fun and they're
respectful. They don't shout or be rude or anything like that.
Interviewer: And what would you consider a bad day at work?
James: Uh, when students are just bad, they're disrespectful, they don't listen to the teacher,
they just don't want to do work. Then, maybe it's too hot or something like that. So, they
just don't like have the respect to just keep quiet when I'm talking, because I don't talk
much in my lessons. I do about 15 minutes of talking and then we start getting into more of
a student-centered learning where they have to do an activity or something, you know, to
get involved. So, it's just like, yeah. And also, I don't enjoy it when students talk to me like
I'm on their level. You'll have like kids who are like eight years old trying to talk to you like
you're their friend. I'm not your friend, I'm your teacher, you know. They don't have
manners and they don't have respect for people who are older than them. They just—uhm
yeah. What really annoys me is when I walk in the class and they just start shouting, “Let's
play a game, let's play a game, let's play a game”. That, yeah, I would say is one thing that
would constitute towards a bad day. It's like they just see you sometimes as a toy. Let's play
games, let's play games, let's play English games.
Interviewer: And when you are having a bad day at work, how does it impact your teaching
capabilities or classroom environment?
James: Depends on the next class. Because if you're going to from a bad class to another
bad class, then it's not going to be a good time. Then you like, have to think on your feet of
like, okay, how can I teach them the lesson? And obviously, you have to shift your
methodology because you're like, okay, this kind of class does not have the attention span
for this kind of thing. So, how do I teach the same thing that kind of fits to their attention
span?
Interviewer: So, you try and adjust your lessons based on how you were feeling concerning
the previous lesson?
James: Yes. Or just I have a, I know like, okay, if this class had a bad time with it, this class is
definitely going to have a bad time with it, you know, kind of thing.
Interviewer: And then how does it make you feel, being on your toes?
James: It's okay. It's not really a problem.
Interviewer: And when you're having a good day at work, how does it impact your teaching
capabilities or classroom environment?
James: It's nice. It makes, obviously, you know, it makes teaching feeling like it's going by
faster. And, yeah, it's — I would say it's, yeah, it's okay.
Interviewer: So, your teaching capabilities, do you teach better? Are you more engaged?
James: Yeah, you do. You teach better. You're more engaged. Yeah.
Interviewer: And the classroom environment, are they receptive?
James: Yeah.
Interviewer: Can you elaborate a bit more on what makes a good day in terms of the
classroom environment or teaching capabilities?
James: Uhm, just everyone; students are engaged in the lesson or the activity. Uhm, they're
very respectful, they listen when you speak, and then when it's time to do the activity, they
all take part in it. And yeah, then it just feels like your idea was successful and you're happy.
Interviewer: And when you're going through the motions of having to deal with the
discipline aspect in the classroom, does your co-teacher assist you?
James: Yes, they do assist me.
Interviewer: And, okay, next question. What have you had to adopt or change about
yourself to conform to Korean standards or expectations in the classroom? If so, please
explain.
James: Hmm, I don't conform to the (pause) —
Interviewer: To Korean standards or expectations.
James: Yeah, it's just like — but I teach really young students. So, it's like, I think it's kind of
the same. They're not going to show anything too liberal or like, you know, that kind of
thing. You just stick to very things that are very conservative, nothing too obscene or that's
going to, you know, shake the mold or anything like that. You know, you're not like, you just
stick to like fun colors, animations, you know, very, that kind of thing.
Interviewer: Sorry, I’m just rephrasing the question. What have you had to adopt or change
about yourself personally? So, would you consider yourself to be more of a liberal person in
a conservative society?
James: No, I think I haven't had to change much (pause). Especially at my new school, like I
don't think I've had to change much. I'm very much myself, which is fine. Uhm, I think it's
because my work quality is so high. Uhm, I mean, I have like tattoos and they've seen it and
they compliment it and say it looks nice. And I think the only thing that I do that's not in line
with Korean culture, is I have tattoos that they see at work. But I think that's becoming
more of a OK thing with, uhm, older Koreans. I think it's only like, really old Koreans or in
their 70s and 80s who disapprove.
Interviewer: And when do you suppress unpleasant feelings?
James: Uh, all the time (pause). But I think that's got nothing to do with the teaching and
that's got more to do with my personal endeavors in life.
Interviewer: Suppressing unpleasant feelings, is this in the classroom? Because the study is
about your well-being, teaching.
James: Yes, I would say it's in the classroom because I mean, you can’t— Korea is not really
the society where you can go and, uhm, say like, “I need a mental health day.” You know,
like something bad happened at home etc. It really can only be like, oh, someone passed
away and my family died. Then you can like take a day off for your mental health and
there's like stipulations for that. But they don't see mental health as like a sickness or
anything like that. So, if you're just having a tough day and like, you know, some people get
upset like with their love life or this or that. And then, you know, maybe you just need some
time to yourself. But yeah, in Korea, that's not really a thing.
Interviewer: How do you react to unpleasant feelings?
James: (pause) Uhm, in school?
Interviewer: Yes.
James: Ah, just keep it suppressed until you can get home, and you can go deal with it.
Interviewer: And how would you suppress it? Maybe clenching your fist or breathing,
counting to three...
James: Yeah, just go like we have 10-minute intervals in between. I'll just go close my eyes,
do a couple of breaths, a couple of visualizations about like, life can be good, don't worry.
It's just your opinion on the situation, It's not actually the situation. You'll be OK. And then,
yeah.
Interviewer: And how do you mitigate unpleasant feelings?
James: (pause) By making sure I exercise in the morning and eat healthy and, you know, do
my journaling, my meditation and those kinds of things. I try to set the tone in the morning
before I go to work; that it's going to be a good day.
Interviewer: And what is the impact of suppressing these unpleasant feelings at work?
James: You could lose your temper easily, so you have to really be vigilant.
Interviewer: And what is the benefit of suppressing your feelings at work?
James: You don't lash out at a child unnecessarily.
Interviewer: And do you see yourself as resilient towards emotion or vulnerable?
James: Oh, it fluctuates in between.
Interviewer: Could you elaborate more, please?
James: Uh, some things are harder to deal with, so sometimes it's hard (pause) and some
days it's easy. Some days you realize like, like there's going to be good days and bad days.
It'll be OK. But when the bad—
Interviewer: So, when you are... Sorry, can I continue?
James: Yeah.
Interviewer: So, when you are feeling vulnerable towards emotion, then how does that
impact your classroom environment?
James: (pause) Uhm, not much. I'm really like, I'm here to do a job. Let's go.
Interviewer: So, in what aspect would you find yourself feeling vulnerable to emotion?
James: At work.
Interviewer: And what cultural differences have impacted your well-being in the workplace?
James: (pause) None.
Interviewer: Do you think that you are treated fairly at work? If not, how does it influence
your teaching and behavior at work?
James: Am I treated fairly at work?
Interviewer: Do you think that you are treated fairly at work? If not—
James: Yes, I think I am.
Interviewer: How are you being treated fairly at work? Are things going according to the
contract or...?
James: Yeah, things are going according to the contract. Everything's perfect. I have no
complaints.
Interviewer: Do you consider yourself to be part of a team with staff at school? If not, do
you make any attempts to fit in with colleagues?
James: Yeah, I do feel like I'm part of a team and I make an effort to, yeah, I talk to a lot of
my colleagues and everything's good. I have good rapport with my colleagues.
Interviewer: Okay, that's all. Thank you very much for participating in the research.
James: No problem.
