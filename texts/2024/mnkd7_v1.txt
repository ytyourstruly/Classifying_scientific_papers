Abstract
Tracing the stories people have read may help us understand their beliefs and social attitudes. In
this study, we develop and validate a scale to measure racial diversity in people’s fiction reading:
the Heterogenous Author Recognition Test (HeART). To validate the scale, participants
completed the HeART alongside vocabulary, reading comprehension, and self-reported reading
habits. Our results suggest that the HeART is a valid measure of 1) how much people read
overall, and 2) the racial composition of people’s reading habits. Initial results also suggest that
more diverse reading habits are associated with lower anti-Black prejudice. Together, these
findings validate the HeART as a measure of the racial diversity in individuals’ long-term
reading habits that may facilitate research on the relationship between habitual race-specific
reading and interpersonal attitudes.

Introduction
Any avid reader will tell you how easy it is to lose yourself in a compelling story. When
immersed in fictional narratives, readers are transported from their current moment into the
world of the story–they come to suspend their disbelief (Escalas, 2007), experience the mental
states and emotions captured within the narrative (Bal & Veltkamp, 2013; Johnson et al., 2013),
and connect with the book’s characters (van Krieken et al., 2017). Fiction reading may also
impact individuals beyond the moments in which they are actively reading, influencing their
social attention, acuity, and attitudes (Buttrick et al., 2023; Katz, 2006; Mar et al., 2009; Peterson
et al., 2016; Tamir et al., 2015). To better understand this relationship between reading and social
attitudes, it is important to examine the stories that people habitually read–and, more specifically,
the diversity of the narratives they habitually encounter. Here we develop a tool designed to
capture these characteristics of long-term fiction reading habits.
Recent evidence suggests that reading fictional stories by authors and about characters
from different social groups (i.e., outgroup members) can reduce prejudice. Lab studies and
short-term interventions have demonstrated that after reading stories about stigmatized groups,
including disabled children, Muslim-Americans, and transgender individuals, majority-group
readers exhibit less prejudice toward those groups (Cameron et al., 2006; Johnson et al., 2013;
Orellana et al., 2020). This reduction in prejudice is largely attributed to the psychological
impacts of reading fictional narratives–the suspension of disbelief and identification with the
main character that readers experience (Escalas, 2007; van Krieken et al., 2017). Some
researchers even posit that reading narratives about outgroup characters functions as a form of
intergroup contact, allowing readers to form simulated “connections” with individuals from other
social groups, thereby reducing their animosity towards those groups (Johnson et al., 2013).
Reading about outgroup members impacts attitudes towards those groups in the short
term (Paluck & Green, 2009; Paluck et al., 2021; Orellana et al., 2020; Johnson et al., 2013).
However, we know less about the long-term relationship between habitual reading and attitudes.
Does regular exposure to diverse narratives sustain the observed effects of momentary prejudice
reduction (Hill & Augoustinos, 2001)? Past research has been limited in its ability to consider the
relationship between regular, ongoing exposure to outgroup narratives and individuals’ beliefs
and behaviors because, to date, no validated measure exists to assess individuals’ long-term
exposure to stories about specific outgroups.
The most established measure of long-term reading behavior–the Author Recognition
Test (ART)–was developed in 1989 and refined in 1992 (Stanovich & West, 1989; Stanovich &
Cunningham, 1992). The ART assesses an individual’s reading habits based on their ability to
recognize real author names among decoy names from a list of 130 names (Stanovich &
Cunningham, 1992). An individual’s score on the ART corresponds to the number of real authors
they select minus the number of foils they incorrectly select. ART scores reliably correspond
with how much an individual reads fictional literature (i.e., narratives), and correlate highly with
vocabulary, reading comprehension, and self-reported reading volume (Stanovich &
Cunningham, 1992). However, the authors that comprise the items on the original ART are
almost entirely White men who primarily wrote about White male characters. Out of 65 names,
only four are neither White nor male, and 40 are both White and male (Stanovich &
Cunningham, 1992). Thus, while the ART is a robust indicator of how much an individual reads,
it cannot quantify the racial diversity of whom readers are reading about.
In the following studies, we introduce the Heterogeneous Author Recognition Test
(HeART), a modified version of the ART designed to capture racial and gender diversity in
individuals’ long-term reading habits. Like the original ART, the HeART measures an
individual’s general reading volume. In addition, unlike the ART, the HeART is composed of
equal numbers of authors from four different racial groups, known for primarily writing about
characters of their own race. This makes it possible to measure the diversity of characters and
narratives participants have encountered. This updated measure should enable future research on
long-term exposure to stories about different racial groups, and their relation to social attitudes
and behaviors.
This study has two primary aims. The first is to validate the HeART as a reliable measure
of overall reading volume. If HeART scores correlate positively with established covariates of
reading volume (i.e., vocabulary, reading comprehension, self-reported reading habits), then we
can infer that the HeART is a valid measure of participants’ general long-term reading habits.
The second aim of this study is to validate the HeART as a measure of the racial diversity of
participants’ reading habits. If HeART racial subscores (the number of authors of each racial
group that they correctly identify) correlate positively with participants’ self-reported
consumption of books that are by/about people of that racial group, then we can infer that the
HeART is also a valid measure of participants’ exposure to stories about specific racial groups.
By validating the HeART in these two ways, we hope to provide a measure that may be utilized
to effectively explore the connection between long-term fiction reading habits and wider social
or group-based attitudes.
Methods
These studies proceeded in three parts. First, we developed the HeART scale by
compiling a list of author names and foils. Second, we ran four independent validation studies
(Studies 1a-d). These studies investigated whether the HeART accurately captures overall
reading behavior (Studies 1a-c) and race-specific reading habits (Studies 1b-1c). Third, we
explored whether race-specific reading, as captured by the HeART, correlates with participants’
racial prejudice (Study 1d).
Scale Development
The HeART was built to contain 64 authors (closely matching other ARTs), evenly
distributed across four racial groups (Black, White, Latinx, and Asian) and two genders (male
and female), with 16 authors in each race-gender subgroup.
Authors were selected from online compilations on Goodreads, Wikipedia, and the
Barnes & Noble website. Authors were selected who largely write about characters of their own
race. This ensures that the HeART captures readers’ exposure to diverse racial characters while
only estimating exposure to authors (see Appendix A for an explanation of how author
recognition tests effectively capture print exposure).
In choosing the items on the HeART, we ensured that the selected authors represented a
range of popularity levels, to minimize floor and ceiling effects and to promote variability in
participants’ results. To measure each author’s popularity, their names were entered into the
Google Books Ngram Viewer–a tool that charts the occurrence of a particular phrase (in this
case, the author’s name) in the corpus of English-language publications over time (Adams,
2015). In other words, the Ngram viewer is a measure of the public recognition that each author
garnered annually. At the time of scale development, data was available for each author up to the
year 2020. Based on the search results of approximately 100 published authors, we determined
the range of Ngram percentages that could be expected for most authors (see Appendix B).
Authors were selected belonging to each racial group who represented a range of popularity
levels, as roughly estimated by their Ngram percentage (see Appendix C for the full list of
HeART author names).
After selecting the 64 authors, we generated 64 decoy names (foils) that we ensured did
not belong to any published author. Half of these foil names were borrowed from the 2008
Martin-Chang & Gould list of ART foils (Martin-Chang & Gould, 2008), and the other half were
pulled from baby-naming websites (Céspedes, 2011; Khoo, 2017; Su, 2021). Foil names were
balanced by gender and selected to match the four racial groups present in the study. Because the
foil names were fabricated and do not correspond to real individuals, we used Namsor (an online
AI tool that relies on U.S. census data) to generate likely racial identity for each foil name. See
Appendix D for the full list of foil names.
Validation Procedures
We conducted four independent studies (Study 1a through 1d) to validate the HeART.
Each study was administered through Qualtrics surveys containing the HeART alongside a
battery of other measures. The other measures included established correlates of overall reading
volume (e.g., vocabulary, reading comprehension skills) and self-reports of race-specific reading
populations and procedures used in each of the four studies.
HeART. Participants began each study by completing the HeART. The instructions
informed subjects that they would see a list of names that included both real authors and foils.
Participants were instructed to select the names they recognized as authors, and they were
warned that they would lose points if they selected any foils (to discourage them from selecting
names randomly). The order of the names on the HeART was randomized for each participant to
avoid ordering effects. True author names and foil names were randomly interspersed.
Participants received one point for each author they correctly identified, and lost one
point for each foil they incorrectly selected. The racial HeART subscores corresponded to the
number of authors of each race that participants correctly identified (out of 16 total authors for
each race), minus the number of foil names belonging to each racial group that they incorrectly
identified.
If the HeART is calibrated at a level of difficulty similar to that of previous ARTs, then
we should observe a mean HeART score that is relatively low (i.e., between 9 and 15 points).
Additionally, item response analysis should reveal that the individual items on the HeART
represent a range of difficulty (i.e., the easiest item recognized by more than 50% of participants
and the hardest item recognized by less than 1% of participants).
Overall Reading Volume Validation. If the HeART is a valid measure of reading
volume, we should see robust correlations between overall HeART scores and literacy. We
assessed literacy level with vocabulary tests, reading comprehension tests, and self-reported
reading habits. In previous studies validating the original ART, researchers typically observed
weak to moderate positive correlations (ranging from 0.2 to 0.6) between participants’ ART
scores and participants’ scores on vocabulary tests, reading comprehension tests, and self-reports
of reading volume. As such, we considered a correlation of at least r = 0.20 between HeART
scores and reading comprehension, vocabulary, and self-reported reading volume as evidence
that the HeART is a valid measure of overall reading volume.
Vocabulary Tests. The original ART validation included the Nelson-Denny Reading and
Vocabulary Test (Brown, 1960) to establish a link between scores on the ART and vocabulary
skills (Stanovich & Cunningham, 1992). In Study 1a and 1c, we replaced the Nelson-Denny test
with the 2022 Princeton Review GRE vocabulary practice test as a more up-to-date measure of
college-level vocabulary skills. Participants had 10 minutes to answer 16 vocabulary questions
that involved choosing the best word to complete a sentence and identifying synonyms from a
list of six choices. Following the GRE’s scoring practices, participants earned one point for each
correct answer and lost no points for wrong answers.
In Study 1b, we used the Wechsler Vocabulary Test (Weschler, 1999), chosen because it
more closely approximated the Nelson-Denny test (Ready et al., 2013). This allowed us to
maintain as much fidelity as possible to the original validation procedures, while also using an
accessible measure. This test presented participants with 28 words of increasing complexity, and
asked them to choose the best definition from three options. Participants earned two points for
selecting the best definition, one point for selecting a partial/incomplete definition, and zero
points for incorrect answers.
Reading Comprehension. The original ART validation included the comprehension
subsection of the Nelson-Denny Reading Test to establish a link between ART scores and
reading comprehension abilities. In our studies, we again replaced the Nelson-Denny test with
the 2022 Princeton Review GRE reading comprehension practice test as a contemporary measure
of college-level reading comprehension skills. Participants had 20 minutes to read four passages
and answer 10 questions gauging their comprehension of the passages. True to the GRE scoring,
participants received one point for each fully correct answer, and lost no points for incorrect
answers.
Self-Report General Reading Habits. Participants answered questions about their general
reading habits. These questions were adapted from the original ART validation’s Reading and
Media Habits Questionnaire to be relevant to both college students and the wider adult
population. The questions asked how many hours participants spent each week reading books
(both fiction and overall), and how many books (both fiction and overall) they read in the past
month (See Appendix E for full list of questions). Participants were instructed to respond with a
single number for each question. We calculated a “nonfiction books per month” score from the
difference between their number of overall books and their number of fiction books per month.
This nonfiction score was used to test whether the HeART was primarily predictive of fiction
reading over other forms of print exposure. In Studies 1a and 1c, participants were also asked to
report how often they read for pleasure (Likert scale from never to very frequently, modeled after
previous validation studies).
Raven’s Matrices. Cognitive ability is a known correlate of literacy level. Thus, we
expected a positive association between HeART scores and Raven’s Advanced Progressive
Matrices scores, a task that measures analytical intelligence and general cognitive ability.
Following the procedures of the original ART validation, we used Raven’s Matrices as a control
measure to determine whether the HeART predicts reading habits beyond participants’ cognitive
abilities. Participants were given six minutes to solve nine problems from Raven’s Matrices that
asked them to identify an option (from six choices) that best completes an abstract visual pattern.
In Studies 1c-1d, we also included self-report measures of education (‘What is the highest
level of education you have received?’) and income (‘What is your annual household income?’)
as additional control variables.
Race-specific Reading Validation. If the HeART is a valid measure of race-specific
reading habits, we should see robust correlations between HeART racial subscores and the racial
composition of their self-reported reading habits. We measured the racial composition of
participants’ reading habits by asking participants to estimate the percentage of their books by
and about Black, White, Latinx, and Asian individuals, and to provide a list of the actual books
they had most recently read as an indirect measure of these racial patterns. As no ART has
previously attempted to capture racial patterns in participants’ reading behavior, we had no
pre-established benchmark for this validation. Following the expected values of the overall
reading volume validation, we anticipated small (r > 0.2) but reliable correlations between
participants’ HeART racial subscores and their reports of the proportion of their books that are
by/about people of that racial group.
1. Self-Reported Race-specific Reading. Participants answered two questions to gauge the
racial diversity of the characters and authors in their fiction reading: Think about the
fiction books that you read, and the [author/main character] of each book. What
percentage of those [authors/characters] are of the following races? Participants recorded
responses on a sliding scale from 0 to 100 for the percentage of their reading that was
about/by someone who was Black, White, Asian, Latinx, or Other. The purpose of
including both the character and author question was to examine whether there were any
nuances in how each of these two factors related to an individual’s HeART score. In
addition, we could test the strength of the correlation between the two questions. Since
authors were selected for the HeART if they specifically wrote about characters of their
own race, we expected that recognizing an author of a particular race would also signify
exposure to characters of that race.
2. Self-Reported Recent Reading. As an additional measure of reading behavior,
participants reported the titles of the 10 most recent books they had read. If they could
not remember all 10 books (or had not read 10 books), they were instructed to report as
many as they could remember. Researchers manually coded the race of the author of each
reported book, allowing us to calculate how many books each participant had recently
read by authors from each racial group.
Racial Prejudice. In Study 1d, we explored whether participants’ reading habits were
linked to their racial prejudice. Participants completed two anti-Black prejudice measures, one
explicit and one implicit. We expected to observe a correlation between both explicit and implicit
anti-Black prejudice measures and participants’ Black HeART subscore specifically.
For the explicit prejudice measure, participants rated Black and White people on a scale
from 1 to 7 on the following traits: trustworthiness, violence, and intelligence (Peyton & Huber,
2021). They also rated their warmth toward Black and White people on a scale from 1 to 10, an
item adapted from Project Implicit (Nosek et al., 2007).
For the implicit prejudice measure, participants completed the Race Implicit Association
Test (IAT) adapted from Project Implicit (Nosek et al., 2007) to capture implicit anti-Black bias.
In this task, participants were presented with a series of faces, both Black and White, and a series
of words, both positive and negative. Participants sorted the faces and words in two conditions:
one where Black and positive words were sorted together, and one where Black and negative
words were sorted together. The difference in reaction time (in milliseconds) between the two
conditions was calculated and converted into a scaled score of implicit anti-Black prejudice.
Higher numeric IAT scores indicate less anti-Black prejudice.
Population and Procedures
Studies 1a through 1d were largely similar, with slight variations in populations and
included only from participants who consented to participate, finished the entire study, and
completed an honesty check at the end of the study acknowledging that they took the test
carefully and paid close attention. We excluded participants who finished the whole study faster
than two times the standard deviation from the mean completion time. Additionally, we excluded
participants who spent less than 30 seconds on the HeART itself.

HeART Metrics
Before assessing whether the HeART effectively captures individual differences in
reading habits, we first tested the measure’s range and overall difficulty. To do so, we conducted
item response analyses and descriptive analyses on the distribution of HeART scores from
Studies 1a-d. The correct response rates for individual author names ranged from 65.4% for Jane
Austen to 0.4% for Pam Muñoz Ryan (see Appendix C for the selection rates for individual
author names). The mean selection rate for an individual author was 13.1%. The mean number of
errors per participant was 1.1, with a standard deviation of 2.5.
Overall HeART scores observed across the four studies (mean = 9.5; SD = 8.5) were on
par with the average score of the original ART (mean = 9.3, SD = 5.7) (Stanovich &
Cunningham, 1989). Across studies, the maximum score was 50 out of 64, which reflects the
overall difficulty of the test, and is in the expected range based on prior validation studies
(Stanovich & Cunningham, 1989; Stanovich & West, 1992; Acheson et al, 2008; Moore &
Gordon, 2015).
Across studies, participants’ average White HeART subscores were slightly higher than
their Black, Latinx and Asian subscores. In order to determine whether individual differences in
participant’s’ overall HeART scores were driven primarily by any one racial subscore, we
performed four separate linear regressions to determine the extent to which each racial subscore
accounted for the overall HeART score variance. All R-squared statistics were approximately
equivalent, ranging from 0.75 to 0.80. As such, it was determined that each subscore was equally
important in predicting an individual’s overall HeART score.

1989 ART was out of 50 points, while all others were out of 64 or 65 points.
Overall Reading Volume Validation
The first goal of our studies was to evaluate whether the HeART serves as a valid
measure of participants’ overall reading volume. If valid, HeART scores should positively
correlate with vocabulary test scores, reading comprehension test scores, and self-reported
reading habits, even when controlling for overall cognitive ability using Raven’s Matrices. Based
on the effect sizes observed in previous ART validation studies, we expected to find weak to
moderate correlations (approximately r=0.25 to r=0.45).
In all studies, we observed moderate positive correlations between HeART scores and
(r’s= 0.39 [CI 0.28, 0.49], 0.21 [CI 0.22, 0.32], 0.25 [CI 0.14, 0.36], and 0.32 [CI 0.20, 0.44], all
cognitive ability, income, and education where the measures were available in Study 1c (r=0.12,
p=0.001) Further, as measured in Studies 1a and 1c, we observed significant positive correlations
between HeART scores and self-reported frequency of reading for pleasure (r=0.27 [CI 0.16,
0.38], r=0.31 [CI 0.20, 0.41], p’s<0.001). In each study, the correlation between fiction books per
month and HeART score was stronger than the correlation between nonfiction books per month
and HeART score, suggesting that, as intended, the HeART is primarily predictive of fiction
reading habits.
Across the three studies that included vocabulary measures (Studies 1a-1c), we found a
significant and positive association between HeART scores and vocabulary test scores (r’s = 0.43
association remained when controlling for cognitive ability, income, and education, where the
measures were available in Study 1c (0.24, p<0.001).
Finally, in the study that included a reading comprehension measure (1a), we observed a
significant and positive association between HeART scores and reading comprehension scores
cognitive ability, which was available in Study 1a (r=0.28, p<0.05).
While correlations between HeART scores and our chosen validation metrics were
numerically slightly weaker than those reported on the original ART validation (r=0.36 [CI 0.26,
0.45], 0.60 [CI 0.52, 0.67], and 0.54 [CI 0.45, 0.62), (Stanovich & Cunningham, 1992), they
were comparable to or higher than more recent ART retests and updates (0.16 [CI -0.04, 0.35],
0.44 [CI 0.32, 0.54], and 0.29 [CI 0.10, 0.46]) (Acheson et al., 2008; Moore & Gordon, 2015).

Race-specific Reading Validation
The second goal of our studies was to evaluate whether the HeART serves as a valid
measure of participants’ exposure to books written by authors of different racial groups. If valid,
we would expect to see a positive correlation between participants’ self-reported reading habits
for each racial group, and the corresponding racial subscore on the HeART. For Black, Latinx,
and Asian authors, this is exactly what we found (Study 1b)– the more participants reported
White authors, however, there was no significant correlation between reported reading and
HeART subscore.
We also expected to see a positive correlation between participants’ HeART racial
subscores and the number of books from their ten most recent titles that were written by authors
from the four racial groups. As expected, in Study 1c we found significant positive correlations
between participants' Latinx HeART subscore and the number of Latinx authors in their recent
reading.
In both studies, we see that the HeART racial subscore was best predicted by the
self-reported reading habits and books listed for that racial subgroup. For example, the Black
subscore was best predicted by self-reported reading of Black authors and recently read books by
Black authors. This lends further discriminant validity to the measure.
As a convergent analysis, we tested the correlation between the percentage of books
participants reported reading by authors of each racial group and the percentage of books
participants reported reading about characters of each racial group. These correlations were
strong and significant (r’s > 0.64, p < 0.01, implying that race-specific author recognition
corresponds to race-specific character exposure (see Appendix F for a detailed description).

Reading and Prejudice
Finally, in Study 1d, we conducted exploratory analyses to investigate whether White
participants’ Black HeART subscores were inversely related to their anti-Black prejudice. If
higher Black HeART subscores reflect greater exposure to books by and about Black individuals,
we would expect higher scores to be associated with lower anti-Black prejudice.
As expected, we found a significant negative correlation between White participants’
Black HeART subscore and their explicit anti-Black prejudice (r=-0.20, p=0.003). Higher Black
HeART subscores also marginally predicted reduced implicit prejudice (r=-0.12, p=0.06). We
also found a significant correlation between White participants’ overall HeART score and lower
implicit (r=-0.15, p=0.02) and explicit (r=-0.22, p<0.001) anti-Black prejudice, suggesting that
more frequent reading overall, in addition to reading about Black characters, is associated with
lower prejudice. These relationships persist even when controlling for level of education. See
Appendix G for detailed statistics on these relationships, including a breakdown of the composite
explicit prejudice measure.

Discussion
Four studies aimed to validate the HeART as a measure of both overall reading volume
and race-specific reading habits. HeART scores correlate positively with established predictors
of reading volume (i.e., vocabulary, reading comprehension, and self-report reading habits),
demonstrating the HeART’s validity as a measure of overall reading. Additionally, HeART racial
subscores were positively associated with participants’ self reported consumption of books by
authors of corresponding races in most cases, supporting its utility in capturing exposure to
stories by and about specific racial groups. Black HeART subscores were negatively correlated
with anti-Black prejudice, providing preliminary evidence for a connection between race-specific
reading habits and social attitudes. Together, these findings establish the HeART as an effective
tool for measuring both general and race-specific reading habits.
The HeART is a valid and inclusive measure of overall reading volume. Across studies,
HeART scores significantly and positively correlated with vocabulary, reading comprehension,
and self-reported reading habits, even after controlling for cognitive ability, income, and/or
education. Thus, just like earlier ART iterations, the HeART captures reading behavior above
and beyond other influential factors. Unlike earlier ART iterations, which were heavily skewed
toward White male authors (Stanovich & Cunningham, 1992), the HeART includes equal
representation of Black, White, Latinx, and Asian authors, and male and female authors, making
it a more representative tool for capturing reading habits. This inclusivity enhances its relevance
as a contemporary measure, and strengthens its generalizability to a broader population. While
mean HeART scores were slightly lower than those reported in past ART iterations, these
differences may reflect shifting media consumption trends: as individuals increasingly engage
with non-literary media, lower average author recognition scores may be expected (Clark &
Teravainen-Goff, 2020). Furthermore, it’s possible that our samples– which included mostly
White participants– would have performed better on a traditional, mostly-White ART, as White
authors continue to remain centered in academic and popular spaces, and even within our
measure, participants performed best on the White author subsection (Reed & Rodick, 2023).
Nevertheless, the fact that the HeART demonstrates convergence with other predictors of reading
volume while maintaining gender and racial balance in its items establishes it as an effective,
reliable, and broadly representative measure of long-term fiction exposure.
Further, the HeART broadly captures racial patterns in reading habits. Each HeART racial
subscore was best predicted by participants’ self-reported reading habits for each corresponding
racial subgroup, though the strength and significance of these relationships varied across studies.
In Study 1b, participants’ self-reported percentage of books read by Black, Latinx, and Asian
authors correlated with their corresponding HeART racial subscores, though there was no
significant correlation for White authors. One explanation is that White participants (who
comprised the majority of the sample in Study 1b) may be less aware of when they are reading a
book by a White author or about White characters, as Whiteness often operates as a “default”
(Moreton-Robinson, 2004). In Study 1c, participants’ self-reported list of recently read books by
Black, Asian and White authors correlated with their corresponding HeART racial subscore,
though there was no significant correlation for Latinx authors. It’s possible that this is due to the
fact that rates of reading Latinx authors were lower than the other groups (especially Black and
White authors), meaning there may be less variance available to detect a correlation.
Additionally, it is worth noting that Study 1b asked participants to report what percentage of the
books they read were by authors of each race, while Study 1c asked participants to directly report
their most recent titles. It is possible that the different patterns in race-specific reading
correlations that were observed between these two studies was due to these different collection
methods. Still, these findings together suggest that the HeART provides a general picture of
race-specific reading habits. Additional validation efforts with objective metrics of individuals’
long-term reading habits, such as reading journals or Goodreads data, would further bolster the
precision of our measure of the HeART’s race-specific validity.
Finally, our results provide compelling preliminary evidence for the connection between
fiction reading habits and wider social attitudes. The HeART’s Black subscore was negatively
correlated with anti-Black prejudice. Overall HeART scores (i.e., the extent to which participants
generally read a diverse range of authors) were also negatively correlated with anti-Black
prejudice. Both relationships persisted even when controlling for education. This initial evidence
of a relationship between reading and social attitudes could reflect several interesting
possibilities. First, social attitudes may influence reading habits– People with lower prejudice
might choose to read more diverse authors. Second, a common factor (e.g., political orientation
or geographic location) may lead to both diverse reading habits and lower prejudice. Third,
long-term reading practices may shape social attitudes. Prior work examining the relationship
between fiction reading and social cognition indicates that any interventional effect of reading on
attitudes is very small (Dodell-Feder & Tamir, 2018) at best (Dodell-Feder et al., 2023). For this
reason, any causal shift in attitudes would likely require long-term, intensive change in the
literature consumed by individuals.
The HeART may serve as an important tool for future research into the relationship
between long-term race-specific reading behavior and social attitudes, or for exploring the
emotional and psychological mechanisms that might mediate this relationship. Future research
might also explore the relationship between reading habits and broader social beliefs and
attitudes, such as awareness of systemic racism in different social institutions. Furthermore,
though the above studies focused on race-specific reading, the HeART was also designed with
gender balance across items. As such, the HeART may provide an opportunity for future research
to consider the relationship between gender-specific reading behavior and relevant social
attitudes.
While promising, the HeART is not without limitations. First, validating race-specific
reading habits relied on self-reports, which require both honesty and memory, and may not
always capture long-term reading trends. Second, the racial composition of the participant
samples, which were predominantly White, limits the generalizability of findings to other racial
groups. In validating the HeART, it may be pertinent to account for how race impacts one’s
score, and to control for race in assessing individual differences. Unfortunately, there was not
enough power to sufficiently analyze these questions in the current studies. Future research
should explore how participants’ demographics (e.g., race, gender, socioeconomic status, etc.)
impact their HeART score and predictive validity to ensure that the HeART is a broadly
accessible and valid measure.
Conclusion
Author recognition tests present a fast and easy way to assess lifetime exposure to
fictional narratives. As a contemporary and more representative author recognition measure, the
HeART may serve as a useful tool in future research. Additionally, the HeART offers a potential
avenue through which to explore race-specific reading patterns, and their potential relation to
social attitudes and behaviors. Given emerging evidence on the relationship between exposure to
fictional stories about outgroup members and outgroup prejudice (Cameron et al., 2006; Johnson
et al., 2013; Orellana et al., 2020), the HeART may lay the groundwork for future research that
assesses the long-term psychological correlates and consequences of regularly reading fictional
narratives about multiple racial groups.
