SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 3
Abstract
To expand their knowledge and satisfy their intellectual curiosity, people need to engage in self-
directed information seeking. However, curiosity research often relies on experimental tasks that
explicitly prompt information seeking instead of capturing participants’ self-initiated exploratory
behaviors. The present study aimed to combine aspects of experimental curiosity research with more
naturalistic exploration methods by introducing a novel experimental set-up that captured self-directed
information seeking as a more naturalistic behavioral measure of curiosity. In a preregistered online
study (N = 799), participants freely explored a hypertext on a historical topic while their self-directed
information seeking (i.e., clicks on hyperlinks and reading time) was captured with log files.
Participants then completed a knowledge test in which they also reported their confidence in their
answers and their curiosity about learning the correct answers, similar to commonly used curiosity
tasks. Additionally, participants’ trait curiosity was measured with a questionnaire before they read the
hypertext. Using mixed-effects regression models, we found that simply choosing to seek additional
information (click on a hyperlink) did not predict subsequent curiosity ratings, whereas the extent of
engagement in information seeking (reading time) did. Moreover, trait curiosity moderated the
relationship between confidence and state curiosity, with highly trait curious individuals maintaining
higher state curiosity under low confidence, unlike those with low trait curiosity. This study presents a
promising way to assess self-directed information-seeking behavior as a manifestation of curiosity and
provides a comprehensive perspective on the dynamic ways in which curiosity is sparked and
satisfied.

SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 4
From Clicks to Curiosity: Exploring Self-Directed Information Seeking as a Behavioral
Manifestation of Curiosity
Intellectual or epistemic curiosity can be defined as a “desire to know,” which drives people to
engage in information-seeking behaviors (Litman, 2005; Loewenstein, 1994). It can be captured as a
general dispositional tendency to desire new knowledge (i.e., trait curiosity) or as a momentary
experience that motivates people to acquire a specific piece of information (i.e., state curiosity).
To study state curiosity, researchers often use the trivia question task (Baranes et al., 2015;
Brooks et al., 2023; Dubey & Griffiths, 2020; Fastrich et al., 2018; Gruber et al., 2014; Jach et al.,
2022; Kang et al., 2009; Ligneul et al., 2018; Marvin & Shohamy, 2016; Spitzer et al., 2024). In this
task, participants are first presented with a set of trivia questions (e.g., “What is the only country with
a national dog?”) and are asked how curious they are to learn the answer to each question (self-
reported state curiosity). Several studies then include a second phase in which participants can decide
to either skip the answer or reveal it by investing time (e.g., 10 s) or tokens (e.g., Jach et al., 2022;
Marvin & Shohamy, 2016; Spitzer et al., 2024). This willingness to wait or pay to see the answer is
considered a behavioral manifestation of their (state) curiosity, in line with the idea that curiosity
should prompt information-seeking behavior. The two measures of state curiosity—self-reported and
behavioral—usually map onto each other, as participants are more likely to wait or pay to reveal the
answers to the questions they reported they were more curious about (e.g., Baranes et al., 2015; Dubey
& Griffiths, 2020; Marvin & Shohamy, 2016).
Whereas the trivia question task offers a straightforward and efficient way to study state
curiosity, its ecological validity may be somewhat limited. Participants are explicitly made aware of a
knowledge gap (by being asked a trivia question they likely do not know the answer to) and are then
given a convenient way to close it (by deciding to reveal the answer). By contrast, curiosity in
everyday life tends to arise more spontaneously, and people usually need to invest effort to retrieve the
information that will satisfy their curiosity (von Stumm & Ackerman, 2013). Therefore, the
information-seeking behavior in the trivia question task (i.e., the decision to reveal the answer) may
reflect a reaction to an explicit prompt rather than participants’ self-initiated exploratory behavior.
Furthermore, the answers to these trivia questions are typically one-word answers, and it is assumed
SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 5
that curiosity is satisfied and vanishes once the answer has been revealed (Loewenstein, 1994).
However, most real-world learning experiences are not as clearly defined or closed-ended, and
satisfying initial curiosity could also spark curiosity to learn more about the topic (Hidi & Renninger,
2019; Murayama, 2022). In the trivia question task, the potential development of a more sustained
interest cannot be captured, as curiosity is typically assessed only once, limiting this paradigm to less
complex tasks.
Another line of research that taps into more naturalistic exploratory information-seeking
behaviors aimed at knowledge acquisition are studies that analyze individuals’ reading behavior on
Wikipedia (Lydon-Staley et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2024). People vary in how they browse Wikipedia,
with some visiting articles that are conceptually closely related, whereas others hop between articles
that are only loosely connected. Such behavioral differences have been found to be related to trait-
level measures of curiosity (Lydon-Staley et al., 2021). These studies are highly naturalistic and
exhibit high ecological validity, as they depict how many people nowadays access information
predominantly by looking online (Gross et al., 2020). Furthermore, relying on automatically captured
log data for an unobtrusive assessment of information-seeking behavior circumvents the biases that
come with self-reports and avoids disrupting the information-seeking process (Neuberger, 2016).
Whereas the highly naturalistic nature of studies that use Wikipedia to explore real-world
information seeking is a strength, it also poses the challenge of having less experimental control.
Systematic theory testing can be difficult, and linking these findings to results from experimental
curiosity research in the lab may be challenging. Furthermore, studies have yet to test how log-file
data from information-seeking tasks can be used to study state rather than trait curiosity and how trait-
and state-level curiosity interact (Gross et al., 2020).
Another relevant aspect that has not been considered in existing naturalistic studies on online
reading behavior on Wikipedia (Lydon-Staley et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2024) or in studies using the
trivia question paradigm (Fastrich et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2009) is reading time. Reading time could
serve as an indicator of behavioral engagement (e.g., Bråten et al., 2018; Latini et al., 2019), which is a
valuable aspect to consider for curiosity research. For instance, some people’s curiosity may be short-
lived—they may click on a link out of a momentary experience of curiosity, but once the page opens,
SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 6
their curiosity might not be strong enough for them to actually invest effort in reading and engaging
with the text. In studies using the trivia question task, engagement in terms of reading time is difficult
to assess, as the answers to the trivia questions can be processed in an instant. In general, greater
engagement is likely to be associated with a higher probability of effectively integrating the
information into one's knowledge base, which is particularly important when considering curiosity as a
catalyst of long-term knowledge acquisition (Ackerman, 1996; von Stumm & Ackerman, 2013;
Ziegler et al., 2012, 2018).
In conclusion, each of the two lines of research on curiosity discussed here has distinct
strengths and limitations, prompting the question of how to best combine them. One potential way to
integrate the strengths of controlled experimental tasks (e.g., the trivia question task) with more
naturalistic exploration methods (e.g., Wikipedia reading behavior) is by using short digital texts in
experimental studies. For instance, in a study by von Stumm (2018), participants were taking part in a
lab study where they had to complete cognitive tests on a computer. During an alleged study break, a
webpage about lakes in Croatia appeared on their computer screens. The website included a few
hyperlinks with additional information on certain aspects, for example, climate or local customs. For
the participants, it was not evident that this was part of the study, so any exploration of the website
was intrinsically driven. This type of experimental set-up (i.e., including a text with hyperlinks), which
we also employed in the present study, allows researchers to maintain experimental control because
the potential knowledge space for information seeking is well-defined while still allowing a
spontaneous emergence of curiosity to guide self-directed information seeking.
Experimental set-ups involving texts with hyperlinks that spark self-directed information
seeking also lend themselves to the study of other important features in curiosity research. Because
curiosity is characterized by a desire to explore the unfamiliar or unknown, the appraisal of one’s
existing knowledge plays a role in triggering curiosity. Hence, in most studies using the trivia question
task, participants are asked to first guess the answer and rate their confidence in its correctness as a
metacognitive judgment of their knowledge level (e.g., Dubey & Griffiths, 2020; Jach et al., 2022;
Wade & Kidd, 2019). A very common finding is that the relationship between curiosity and
confidence follows an inverted U-shaped function: Curiosity is low when participants have either no
SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 7
idea what the answer could be or are certain that they know the answer, and curiosity is highest when
participants are moderately confident (Baranes et al., 2015; Kang et al., 2009; Sakaki et al., 2024;
Spitzer et al., 2024). Revisiting whether the inverted U-shape can also be found in experimental
research that combines trivia question tasks with naturalistic information seeking, as in the present
study, could yield important insights into the generalizability of the curiosity-confidence link (Sakaki
et al., 2024). Furthermore, most previous studies have focused solely on the state-level relationship
between confidence and curiosity without including a trait measure of curiosity. However, it is
plausible that this relationship could depend on an individual’s trait-level curiosity. According to
appraisal theories of curiosity, people with higher trait curiosity experience state curiosity more
intensely or more frequently because they appraise novel and complex situations differently than
people with lower levels of trait curiosity (Fayn et al., 2019; Silvia, 2008). This difference in appraisal
may also influence how people perceive situations where they feel less confident in their knowledge,
which could manifest in varying relationships between confidence and state curiosity depending on a
person’s trait-level curiosity. For example, the tendency to perceive inconclusive situations as a chance
for intellectual growth instead of as an aversive challenge should encourage approach behaviors rather
than avoidance (Litman, 2005; Rauthmann et al., 2014).
The Present Study
The aim of this study was to integrate the trivia question paradigm (Fastrich et al., 2018; Kang
et al., 2009) with research on more naturalistic exploration methods (e.g., studies on Wikipedia
reading behavior; Lydon-Staley et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2024) to investigate self-directed information
seeking (i.e., information seeking that participants could engage in at their own pace and according to
their preferences) as a more naturalistic and intrinsically motivated behavioral manifestation of
participants’ curiosity. To gain a comprehensive understanding of how curiosity emerges and is
satisfied, we examined the relationship between self-directed information seeking, trait curiosity,
confidence, and self-reported state curiosity. By introducing an innovative experimental set-up to
study the dynamic interplay of trait curiosity, information seeking, confidence, and self-reported state
curiosity, the present study represents a key step toward a more integrated and nuanced perspective on
curiosity.
SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 8
Specifically, we adopted an experimental set-up in which participants were presented with a
hypertext on the history of the Panama Canal, a topic many people are not too familiar with (see
information on relevant geographical locations or historical figures). Participants were instructed to
read the text but were explicitly informed that they could freely navigate it for as long or as briefly as
they wished (free exploration phase). Participants were also unaware that a knowledge test would
follow. During the free exploration phase, participants’ log-file data were tracked to capture their
information-seeking behavior. After reading, participants were given a surprise knowledge test on the
content of the text with one question for each of the hyperlinks. They rated their confidence in their
answers and their curiosity to learn the correct answer to each question, paralleling the trivia question
paradigm. The correct answer was shown after each question. Furthermore, to investigate how trait-
level curiosity is related to both behavioral and self-reported state curiosity, we assessed participants’
trait intellectual curiosity by administering a questionnaire before the hypertext task. We addressed the
following research questions and hypotheses, which were preregistered on the Open Science
Framework (OSF; anonymized link for peer review:
Research Question 1: Are participants with higher levels of trait curiosity more likely to
experience state curiosity, captured by both self-directed information seeking (i.e., behavioral
curiosity) during the free exploration phase and state curiosity self-reports on the knowledge test? It
has been suggested that people with high levels of trait curiosity should be more likely to experience
state curiosity (Fleeson & Jayawickreme, 2015; Litman et al., 2005). Thus, we expected trait curiosity
to positively predict self-directed information seeking, manifesting as both a higher probability of
clicking on hyperlinks (Hypothesis 1) and a longer time spent reading the text provided in the
hyperlink (Hypothesis 2). The prediction regarding the effect of trait curiosity on state curiosity ratings
was less straightforward in this experimental setting. Whereas, theoretically, we could have expected
that participants with higher trait curiosity would report higher state curiosity during the knowledge
test phase, it was also possible that these participants might have already satisfied their curiosity
during the free exploration phase. This situation could potentially lead to lower curiosity ratings on the
SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 9
knowledge test. Thus, we did not specify a hypothesis on the effect of trait curiosity on self-reported
state curiosity ratings.
Research Question 2: Do behavioral measures of self-directed information seeking (whether a
link was clicked and time spent reading it) predict later state curiosity ratings? As these measures have
not been tested in this context before, our suggestions for their relationships were only tentative (Hidi
& Renninger, 2006; Loewenstein, 1994). Whereas we predicted that behavioral curiosity would
significantly predict later state curiosity ratings (Hypothesis 3), we did not specify the direction of the
effect. Clicking on and reading the hyperlinks could lead to reduced curiosity ratings for the respective
questions, as participants may have already satisfied their curiosity during the free exploration phase.
Alternatively, participants might also remain curious and may want to confirm their responses to the
topics they had just learned about. We further tested whether trait curiosity predicts state curiosity
ratings above and beyond the effects of self-directed information seeking.
Research Question 3: Does confidence predict state curiosity on the knowledge test? On the
basis of previous research (Baranes et al., 2015; Dubey & Griffiths, 2020; Kang et al., 2009; Spitzer et
al., 2024), we expected an inverted U-shaped relationship such that curiosity ratings would be highest
when participants were moderately confident in their answers (Hypothesis 4). We further investigated
whether trait curiosity predicts state curiosity ratings above and beyond the effects of confidence.
Exploratory (Preregistered) Analyses: In exploratory analyses, we investigated all predictors
collectively, first assessing their main effects and then exploring potential interaction effects between
the variables.
Additional (Preregistered) Analyses: Do confidence and behavioral curiosity predict
performance (whether an item was answered correctly) on the knowledge test? These analyses served
as validity checks to determine whether participants could accurately assess their knowledge levels
1 In our preregistration, we indicated that we would further explore the addition of random slopes to each
preregistered model. While incorporating random slopes improved the fit for some models, many failed to
converge. To streamline the manuscript and maintain clarity, we report these exploratory analyses in Online
Supplement S5 and not in the main text.

and to verify whether information-seeking behavior during the free exploration phase contributed to
knowledge acquisition.
Study Procedure
Method
Participants
Data were taken from a project that investigated information-seeking behavior and knowledge
attainment in a hypertext learning task (for more details, see Online Supplement S1). Participants were
recruited through the online research participation platform Prolific. Participants were eligible to
participate if they were between 18 and 30 years old, native English speakers, had acquired a high-
school diploma/completed A-levels, had not been medically diagnosed with dyslexia, and were not
SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 11
from the US, Colombia, or Central America (as they may have higher prior knowledge on the topic of
the hypertext). Each participant was paid £5.40 for a study lasting approximately 35 minutes. The
study was conducted using the German survey platform SoSci Survey (Leiner, 2023). Data were
collected from N = 1,102 participants. First, we excluded participants who exhibited behavioral data
indicative of noncompliance with the task instructions, exhibited off-task behavior, or experienced
technical issues during data collection (n = 142; for more details, see Online Supplement S1). Next,
and as preregistered for this study and similar to previous studies, we excluded additional participants
who did not show any variance in their curiosity ratings across the 18 knowledge-test items (n = 160)
(Dubey & Griffiths, 2020; Spitzer et al., 2024). To ensure that the same sample was used in all
statistical analyses and that all models were comparable, we excluded one more participant who had
missing data in their confidence ratings, resulting in a final sample of N = 799 (M = 25.5, SD =
age age
3.2). We simulated post hoc power analyses for each significant effect in the models addressing the
research questions, based on 50 simulations and an alpha level of .05. Power ranged from 86% to
100%, with 95% confidence intervals ranging from 70.89% to 100%.
Of the participants, 49.4% identified as female, 48.8% as male, and 1.8% as gender
variant/nonconforming. On average, participants spent 6 min on the hypertext and clicked on 8.14
hyperlinks. One hundred sixty-four participants (20.65% of the final sample) did not click on any
hyperlinks, indicating that participants were aware that clicking on hyperlinks was not required in the
study.
Measures
For each question on the knowledge test, there was a corresponding hyperlink within the
hypertext that contained the information required to answer the question. The texts were derived from
the respective Wikipedia articles and modified so that they were similar in length and readability
(ranging from 139 to 190 words). For each of the 18 items on the knowledge test, we considered the
following variables: whether the corresponding hyperlink was clicked (click), time spent reading the
hyperlink (reading time), participants’ confidence in their answer (confidence), their curiosity to learn
the correct answer (state curiosity), and whether the question was answered correctly (performance).
Click was a binary variable, with 1 indicating that the respective hyperlink was clicked and -1
SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 12
indicating that it was not. Reading time was recorded through the log-file data and was measured in
seconds. We considered total time spent on a hyperlink, meaning that if a participant visited a specific
hyperlink multiple times, the times from each visit were added together. Confidence was assessed for
each question on the knowledge test with the item, “How sure are you about your answer?” Responses
were rated on a scale ranging from 1 (very unsure) to 5 (very sure). State curiosity was assessed for
each question with the item, “How curious are you to know the answer?” with a response scale
ranging from 1 (not curious at all) to 5 (very curious). The questions on the knowledge test were
sample item and Online Supplement S2 for the complete knowledge test). Performance was evaluated
on the basis of whether the correct answer was selected, coded as 1 for correct answers and 0 for
incorrect answers. Trait curiosity was measured with the Ideas facet of the Openness to Experience
scale from the NEO-PI-R questionnaire (Costa & McCrae, 1992; Cronbach’s alpha: α = .80). This
scale included eight items (sample item: “I like to solve complex problems”), and its response scale
ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
Analyses
To account for differences in reading speed, we centered reading time within participants
using only the trials where a link was clicked and reading time was therefore > 0. Confidence was also
centered within participants. In additional analyses (not preregistered), we re-ran all analyses using
confidence values that were centered between participants and raw confidence values when interaction
terms were not included (see the Results section for details).
To address our research questions, we specified mixed-effects (logistic) regression models
model that contained only random intercepts for participants ( ) and items ( as a baseline model
1𝑖𝑖 2𝑗𝑗
𝑢𝑢 𝑢𝑢 )
for comparison (McGillivray et al., 2015; Murayama et al., 2014). To compare nested models, we
relied on likelihood ratio tests (LRTs). For further model comparisons, we considered the Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), with smaller values indicating
better model fit (Burnham & Anderson, 2002).
SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 13
For Research Question 1, we specified (logistic) regression models with click (Model 1a,
M1a), reading time (M2a), and state curiosity ratings (M3a) as the outcome variables, and random
intercepts for participants and items. For each model, we added trait curiosity as a Level 2 predictor
(there was no within-participant variance because each participant had only one trait value; M1b-M3b)
and tested whether model fit improved in comparison with their respective baseline models.
To address Research Question 2, we sequentially tested how our indicators of self-directed
information seeking (click, reading time) predicted state curiosity. We ran the analyses for the
variables click and reading time separately. When testing the effects of click, all trials were included
in the analyses (N = 14,382 trials), whereas only the trials in which a link was clicked were considered
when testing the effects of reading time (N = 6,381 trials; 44.37% of overall trials). First, we specified
a model that included click as a predictor (M4a) and compared it with its baseline model (M3a). Next,
we set up a model with reading time as a predictor (M5b) and compared it with its baseline model
(M5a). To account for the possibility that the relationship between reading time and state curiosity
ratings might not be linear, we added a quadratic term in the next step (M5c). Lastly, we added trait
curiosity as a Level 2 predictor to both M4a and M5c and tested for improvement in model fit (M4b
and M5d).
To address Research Question 3, we specified a model with state curiosity ratings as the
outcome variable and confidence as both a linear and quadratic predictor (M6a) and compared it with
the baseline model M3a. In a second step, we added trait curiosity as a Level 2 predictor and tested for
improvement in model fit (M6b).
As exploratory analyses, we considered all predictors (behavioral curiosity, confidence, and
trait curiosity) jointly in a stepwise approach. We first specified a model predicting state curiosity
ratings with click and confidence (both linear and quadratic terms) as predictors. Then, for all trials in
which a link was clicked, we included reading time and confidence in one model. We added trait
2 In the preregistration, we had planned to include both the click and reading time variables in a single model to
assess the predictive power of reading time beyond the click variable. However, when reading time is used as a
within-person-centered variable, 0 has a different meaning for each variable (average reading time vs. a link not
being clicked; see Online Supplement S3 for more details), so they could not be included in the same model.
SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 14
curiosity to both models to test for improvement in model fit. Lastly, for both sets of models (click vs.
reading time), we specified full models that included all main effects and interaction terms. We then
employed backward regression analysis, with the BIC as the deciding criterion, to systematically
reduce model complexity and determine the final model.
Lastly, as additional analyses, we tested for predictors of performance (i.e., whether an item
was answered correctly) on the knowledge test. First, we tested for accuracy in participants’
assessments of their knowledge levels by setting up a mixed-effects logistic regression with
performance as the outcome and confidence as the predictor. Next, we tested whether self-directed
information seeking predicted test performance by specifying two models with click and reading time
as predictors, respectively. All models were compared with a baseline model that included only
participant and item as random intercepts.

Self-Reported State Curiosity as a Function of Behavioral Curiosity
We first investigated whether clicking on a hyperlink predicted later curiosity ratings for the
respective item (M4a). Results showed that click was not a significant predictor of curiosity ratings (b
= -0.002), t(13981.06) = -0.16, p = .871. Although the LRT was significant, χ²(1) = 6.97, p = .008, the
AIC and BIC did not support the model over the random intercept baseline model (M3a). Adding trait
curiosity (M4b) improved the model fit as indicated by the LRT, χ²(1) = 26.72, p < .001, and trait
curiosity was a significant positive predictor of self-reported state curiosity (b = 0.28), t(798.09) =
5.61, p < .001.
Next, only considering read trials, we investigated the effect of reading time on curiosity
ratings. In the first model (M5b), we specified a linear term for reading time, which showed a
significant and negative effect (b = -0.003), t(5589.87) = -3.06, p = .002. However, none of the
measures—LRT, χ²(1) = 3.00, p = .083; AIC; or BIC—favored this model over the baseline model
(M5a), which included only random intercepts for participant and item. Adding a quadratic term for
reading time (M5c) showed both a significant negative linear effect (b = -2.90), t(5577.40) = -3.18, p
= .002, and a significant positive quadratic effect (b = 2.86), t(6048.21) = 2.93, p = .003. The LRT,
AIC, and BIC all favored this model over both the model that included only a linear term and the
baseline model. Adding trait curiosity as a predictor (M5d) further improved the model fit, indicated

The results from the mixed-effects model (M6a) that included both linear and quadratic terms
of confidence in predicting state curiosity revealed a significant negative effect for only the linear term
highest for trials with low confidence in the answer and lowest for trials with high confidence, failing
to provide support for Hypothesis 4. When trait curiosity was added as an additional predictor (M6b),
the model failed to converge.
The nonsignificant quadratic term of confidence (i.e., no support for an inverted U-shaped
relationship) was surprising and contradictory to prior research. We found that previous research that
SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 19
fit regression models to analyze the relationship between confidence and curiosity within the trivia
question paradigm varied in how confidence was scaled. On the one hand, as discussed in Sakaki et al.
(2024), centering or standardizing within participants allows within-person effects to be disentangled
from between-person effects. On the other hand, raw confidence values retain the original scale,
allowing low values to reflect “objectively” low knowledge and high values to reflect high knowledge,
independent of an individual's general knowledge level (e.g., Dubey & Griffiths, 2020; Kang et al.,
2009; Metcalfe et al., 2023; Spitzer et al., 2024; Stare et al., 2018). To test for whether the results on
the quadratic effect of confidence on curiosity depended on the scaling method, we reran all the
analyses using an alternative approach. Because we planned to conduct interaction analyses (see the
Exploratory Analyses section), we used between-person-centered confidence values instead of raw
values to ensure the interpretability of the interaction terms. As an additional check, we used raw
values in all models that did not have interaction terms; the results were identical to the analyses run
with between-person-centered values (see Online Supplement S4). When we refit M6a using between-
person-centered confidence values, we found the expected negative quadratic effect in line with
previous research (b = -11.41), t(14015.85) = -11.14, p < .001, and a negative linear effect (b = -
2 1
revealed lower values for the model using between-person-centered values (AIC = 39577.53; BIC =
39622.97) in comparison with the preregistered model using within-person-centered confidence values
(AIC = 39680.13; BIC = 39725.57), indicating that the models using between-person-centered values
fit the data better. When we added trait curiosity to this model, it did not fail to converge but revealed
a positive effect of trait curiosity on state curiosity ratings (b = 0.29), t(792.76) = 5.75, p < .001. The
model with trait curiosity showed a better model fit than the simpler model without trait curiosity,
χ²(1) = 28.33, p < .001.

Exploratory Analyses
As exploratory analyses, we set up models that included all predictors (behavioral curiosity,
confidence, and trait curiosity) step-by-step to predict state curiosity ratings. Again, we considered two
sets of models: one using click as the behavioral curiosity indicator with all trials included and another
using reading time as the behavioral curiosity indicator, based on the trials in which a link was clicked.
SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 21
We first fit all models using within-person-centered confidence values and then using between-person-
centered confidence values.
Self-Reported State Curiosity as a Function of Click, Confidence, and Trait Curiosity
The first model included click and confidence (both linear and quadratic terms) and showed a
significant negative linear effect for confidence (b = -6.99), t(13620.79) = -7.48, p < .001. Adding
trait curiosity showed a significant positive effect of trait curiosity (b = 0.28), t(798.19) = 5.58, p
< .001, and a significantly better model fit, as indicated by the LRT, χ²(1) = 26.40, p < .001. When we
reran the analyses using between-person-centered confidence values, we found a significant quadratic
effect of confidence (b = -11.43), t(14014.81) = -11.15, p < .001, in addition to a negative linear effect
(b = -6.16), t(14082.72) = -5.67, p < .001. Adding trait curiosity again showed a significant positive
effect (b = 0.29), t(793.44) = 5.73, p < .001, and a significantly better model fit, χ²(1) = 28.06, p
< .001.
Next, we specified a full model including all possible interaction terms. To reduce model
complexity, we conducted a backward regression analysis (see Tables S1 and S2 for information on
the fitted models). The selection of the optimal model was based on the BIC, resulting in the exclusion
of click as a predictor while retaining the interaction between trait curiosity and confidence. Using
within-person-centered confidence, there were significant main effects of trait curiosity (b = 0.28),
t(797.87) = 5.61, p < .001, and the linear term of confidence (b = -6.68), t(13555.62) = -7.22, p
< .001, as well as a significant interaction between the two (b = -9.22), t(13565.64) = -6.81, p < .001.
did not differ much between participants with high or low trait curiosity. However, in trials with low
confidence, participants with high trait curiosity reported higher curiosity ratings than participants
with low trait curiosity. For the models using between-person-centered confidence, the main effect of
the quadratic confidence term (b = -11.03), t(14023.24) = -10.77, p < .001, and the interaction
between the quadratic confidence and trait curiosity term were additionally significant (b = -3.21),
t(14005.67) = -2.01, p = .045. Again, visual inspection suggested that trait curiosity influenced
differences in curiosity ratings for trials with low confidence. Participants with higher trait curiosity
SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 22
reported greater curiosity than those with lower trait curiosity in trials with low confidence (see Panel
Self-Reported State Curiosity as a Function of Reading Time, Confidence, and Trait Curiosity
We set up a model that included reading time (with both linear and quadratic terms, as the
quadratic term turned out to be informative in M5c) and confidence (with both linear and quadratic
terms). First, we entered within-person-centered confidence into the model. Again, only the linear term
was significant and negative (b = -6.37), t(5744.90) = -6.67, p < .001. For reading time, both the
linear (b = -1.96), t(5522.12) = -2.13, p = .033, and quadratic term (b = 2.26), t(6052.11) = 2.31, p
3 4
= .021, were significant predictors, although the effects were smaller in comparison with M5c, which
did not include confidence. Adding trait curiosity revealed that trait curiosity was a significant
predictor (b = 0.29), t(616.57) = 4.96, p < .001, and it significantly improved the model fit according
to the LRT, χ²(1) = 20.35, p < .001. We reran all models again, using between-person-centered
confidence values instead of within-person-centered confidence. For all models, in addition to a
significant linear term (b = -5.69), t(5923.42) = -5.41, p < .001, the quadratic term of confidence was
significant and negative (b = -8.72), t(6083.08) = -8.79, p < .001. Again, trait curiosity was found to
be a significant positive predictor when added to the model (b = 0.30), t(613.17) = 5.18, p < .001. The
other effects remained virtually the same as in the model using within-person-centered confidence.
Next, we ran a full model with all possible interaction terms. The backward regression
analysis indicated that the full model had the best fit (see Tables S3 and S4 for information on all
models). Using within-person-centered confidence values, there were significant main effects of trait
curiosity (b = 0.30), t(623.77) = 5.11, p < .001, and the linear confidence term (b = -5.63), t(5736.02)
1 2
= -5.81, p < .001. There was also a significant interaction between the two (b = -8.87), t(5942.62) = -
6.62, p < .001, as well as between trait curiosity and the quadratic confidence term (b = 3.80),
t(6119.82) = 2.48, p = .013. Again, the differences between participants with high and low trait
curiosity were most pronounced in trials with low confidence ratings. Lastly, the interaction between
the quadratic confidence term and the linear reading time term was significant (b = -169.64),
t(5901.53) = -1.98, p = .048. Using between-person-centered confidence values, we found significant
main effects of trait curiosity (b = 0.31), t(616.31) = 5.39, p < .001, the linear confidence term (b = -

4.82), t(5932.80) = -4.55, p < .001, the quadratic confidence term (b = -8.80), t(6082.31) = -8.78, p
< .001, and the quadratic reading time term (b = 2.23), t(6031.83) = 2.19, p = .028. Furthermore, the
interaction between trait curiosity and the linear confidence term was significant (b = -10.23),
t(6045.43) = -6.47, p < .001. Again, participants with low versus high trait curiosity differed most in
their curiosity ratings in trials where they had low confidence. Lastly, the interaction between the
quadratic confidence term and the linear reading time term (b = -222.79), t(5812.17) = -2.82, p
= .005, and the interaction between the quadratic confidence term and the quadratic reading time term
be an effect of reading time on state curiosity ratings for trials of average confidence. However, for
items that participants were either highly unsure or highly confident about, particularly short and
particularly long reading times seem to increase state curiosity ratings.

We ran additional analyses to investigate predictors of the probability of answering an item
correctly. First, we tested whether confidence predicted performance. The logistic mixed-effects
regression model revealed a significant positive effect of (within-person-centered) confidence (b =
centered values, with similar results (b = 0.49, z = 29.56, p < .001). Next, we tested for whether
clicking on a link increased the probability of answering the item correctly. We found a significant

Discussion
The present study aimed to contribute to a more comprehensive body of knowledge on
curiosity by focusing on the dynamic interplay of behavioral curiosity in terms of self-directed
information seeking, self-reported curiosity, confidence, and trait curiosity. To do so, we introduced an
innovative experimental set-up, combining aspects of curiosity research employing the trivia question
paradigm (Fastrich et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2009) and research on more naturalistic information
search (Lydon-Staley et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2024). Thus, in our study, participants could first freely
read a hypertext to learn about a historical topic before taking a knowledge test on the content in
which they reported both their curiosity and confidence in their answers. We captured self-directed
information seeking, offering a more naturalistic assessment of information seeking as a behavioral
manifestation of curiosity compared with traditional experimental paradigms that assess information
seeking in a more structured and prompted way. Also, the study design allowed us to study more
dynamic processes of curiosity: By allowing participants to engage in self-directed information
seeking before assessing their curiosity about specific pieces of information, we could investigate how
self-directed information seeking affected subsequent curiosity ratings. In addition, we simultaneously
considered several well-established constructs that are central to curiosity research (information
seeking, trait curiosity, confidence, self-reported state curiosity) in a large sample, allowing us to
explore their interactions and to gain a more fine-grained understanding of their interplay. Lastly, our
study makes a methodological contribution by bringing attention to methodological considerations
about how confidence is scaled, which has been implemented in different ways across previous studies
on curiosity. Specifically, we showed that some of the findings differ depending on whether
confidence was treated as a within-person variable (i.e., a person’s confidence in an answer compared
with their other answers) or a between-person variable (i.e., a person’s confidence in their answer
compared with all participants' answers). We next discuss the major findings of our study.
First, our study sheds light on whether higher trait curiosity manifested in greater levels of
state curiosity in line with personality theories that conceptualize personality traits as density
distributions of their respective states (Fleeson, 2001). As an important extension of prior research, we
tested how trait curiosity was related to both behavioral state curiosity (in the form of self-directed
SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 29
information seeking) and self-reported state curiosity (on the knowledge test). While exploring the
hypertext, participants with higher trait curiosity were more likely to click on hyperlinks to seek out
additional information and also exhibited longer reading times after clicking on a link. Participants
with higher trait curiosity also tended to report higher state curiosity ratings on the knowledge test.
Moreover, across all models, trait curiosity was a significant positive predictor of self-reported state
curiosity, beyond other (state-level) variables, and consistently improved model fit. In general, these
findings were in line with our hypotheses, underline the importance of trait curiosity for predicting
different types of state curiosity, and support the idea that people with higher trait-level curiosity
should experience state curiosity more often (Kashdan & Steger, 2007; Litman, 2005).
Next, our study uncovered whether self-directed information seeking in the free exploration
phase predicted state curiosity ratings on the knowledge test. As the behavioral measures had not been
tested before, we did not specify concrete hypotheses on their relationships with self-reported
curiosity. On the one hand, if participants had satisfied their curiosity about a topic during the free
exploration phase, they might no longer feel curious about it during the knowledge test (Loewenstein,
1994). On the other hand, the short hyperlink text could also serve as an introduction to a topic,
sparking further curiosity afterwards (Hidi & Renninger, 2019; Murayama, 2022). Importantly, we
were able to capture varying degrees of engagement within the information-seeking behavior by
measuring reading time rather than relying on only a binary variable representing whether or not
participants clicked on a hyperlink. For instance, two participants may both click on a hyperlink, but
one might read the information very thoroughly whereas the other might only skim the text, which
should affect whether they were actually able to satisfy their curiosity about this topic. Our results
showed that whether a participant had clicked on a hyperlink did not predict their curiosity rating on
the respective topic. However, once a link was clicked, reading time was a significant predictor of
state curiosity ratings. Interestingly, we found both a negative linear relationship and a positive
quadratic relationship, meaning that links with (individually) short reading times resulted in higher
curiosity ratings, but links with particularly long reading times (in comparison with that participant’s
average reading time) did too. Trials with short reading times leading to elevated curiosity ratings
could be due to a lack of understanding—the topic piqued their curiosity enough to click on the link,
SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 30
but the reading time was not sufficient to fully process the information and thus satisfy their curiosity.
Long reading times could be a sign of a very initial development of a more sustained interest in the
topic. Whereas the momentary experience of curiosity might drive someone to click on a hyperlink,
they may discover as they start reading that a situational interest has been triggered and they want to
learn more about this topic (Hidi & Renninger, 2019). This situational interest could lead them not
only to read the text more thoroughly but also to report higher curiosity when asked about the topic
again on the knowledge test. As interest is associated with perceiving greater value in the information,
participants might also feel more invested in getting the correct answer and thus indicate greater
curiosity about learning the answer (Hidi & Renninger, 2006). An alternative explanation for long
reading times could be that long reading times indicate confusion, which could also lead to increased
curiosity later. If the participant struggled to make sense of the hyperlink text, this difficulty could
result in longer reading times (Gwizdka & Spence, 2007). Consequently, they may be more curious
about learning the correct answer because they want to resolve their confusion. When we included the
interaction between confidence and reading time in our models, we found that the quadratic
relationship between reading time and state curiosity could be observed in trials with particularly high
and particularly low confidence but not for trials with moderate confidence. Thus, both explanations
(long reading times as a sign of sustained interest vs. confusion) may hold some truth. Further research
is needed to clarify why curiosity ratings were higher in these cases. For instance, the behavioral trace
data captured during the free exploration phase could be enriched by eye-tracking data, which could
help differentiate between different cognitive states, such as confusion or interest while reading
(Bardach et al., 2024; Hosp et al., 2021; Julku et al., 2023). Alternatively, adding open-ended
questions such as “Why are you particularly curious about this question?” in trials with high curiosity
ratings could shed light on the reasons for participants’ elevated curiosity.
Third, we explored the relationship between confidence and state curiosity. When following
our preregistered analysis plan of using within-person-centered confidence, we found only a negative
linear effect, meaning that with higher confidence in their answer, participants became less curious
about learning the answer. Theoretically, this finding is aligned with novelty-based theories of
curiosity that argue that we should be most curious about novel information, as it is the most
SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 31
intrinsically rewarding for us (Berlyne, 1950; Dubey & Griffiths, 2020). However, empirical findings
have consistently demonstrated an inverted U-shaped relationship between confidence and curiosity
(Baranes et al., 2015; Dubey & Griffiths, 2020; Kang et al., 2009; Spitzer et al., 2024). Different
curiosity theories offer various explanations for this relationship, with recent integrative approaches
suggesting that seeking information of moderate complexity maximizes knowledge gain because
limited gains in knowledge can be expected from information that a person is either already certain of
or cannot relate to any existing knowledge (Dubey & Griffiths, 2020; Ten et al., 2024). Dubey and
Griffiths (2020) attempted to integrate novelty-based and complexity-based theories, suggesting that
people should seek different information depending on the environmental structure. They argued that
people should be novelty-driven rather than complexity-driven in environments in which the prior
knowledge is independent of its probability of being needed in the future. This situation may apply in
our experimental set-up, as participants likely did not expect to be tested on the content of the
hypertext after the experiment ended.
However, we did observe the expected quadratic relationship when we used between-person-
centered confidence (and also raw confidence values) instead of within-person-centered confidence.
Most studies that identified the quadratic relationship used raw or linearly transformed values (Dubey
& Griffiths, 2020; Kang et al., 2009; Metcalfe et al., 2023; Stare et al., 2018) or values that were
scaled within persons (Lyew et al., 2023), but many studies did not report detailed information on their
scaling approach. As discussed by Sakaki et al. (2024), raw values provide a closer approximation of
absolute levels of knowledge, meaning that higher values indicate greater (absolute) knowledge, and
lower values indicate less knowledge. By contrast, within-person-centered values in this study reflect a
participant’s confidence in an item compared with their confidence in all other items on the knowledge
test, thereby removing information on the absolute response scale. In contrast to our findings, Sakaki
et al. (2024) found no significant differences between within-person-centered and raw confidence
values when reanalyzing data from multiple studies that used the trivia question paradigm. One
potential reason for this lack of difference could be that the trivia questions were developed and
sampled so that most people would not know the answers, resulting in generally low confidence
ratings. In our study, however, the distribution of confidence ratings was spread more evenly, with a
SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 32
skew toward higher ratings. Thus, the centering approach may have had a stronger effect due to the
difference in the distributions of confidence ratings. Another possible explanation is the point of
reference participants used when they indicated their confidence in an answer. In the trivia question
task, each question is independent. Participants thus likely evaluate their confidence in absolute terms
and assess their confidence relative to their general knowledge for each question. In our study,
however, all questions were related to the Panama Canal. The fact that we observed different results
for the different scaling approaches may suggest that participants used the other items on the
knowledge test as reference points for their assessment of confidence in a specific item. This tendency
may be particularly interesting for practical applications of curiosity research. In educational contexts,
we rarely learn many stand-alone facts, and the internal comparisons learners make between their
knowledge levels on different topics may come into play. In future research, the choice of scaling
approach should be carefully considered, as it may alter the interpretation of results and reflect
different meta-cognitive processes. Therefore, researchers should align their scaling methods with
their research objectives and report their methods transparently.
We tested how self-directed information seeking, confidence, and trait curiosity jointly
predicted curiosity ratings, and, taking advantage of the large sample size, we tested all interaction
effects. Overall, click was not a relevant predictor of state curiosity ratings. Reading time remained a
significant predictor, though its effect diminished once confidence was added to the model. This
decrease may suggest a potential mediation effect, where longer reading times may lead to greater
confidence in one’s answer. Trait curiosity and confidence consistently predicted curiosity ratings
across all models, as did their interaction. Although the nature of this relationship varied depending on
how confidence was scaled, the general pattern showed that state curiosity ratings differed the most
between participants with different levels of trait curiosity in trials where they had low confidence.
Participants with high trait curiosity were more curious about trials they had less certainty about
compared with the ones in which they had high confidence. They also displayed the strongest negative
linear relationship (for within-person-centered confidence) or inverted U-shaped relationship (for
between-person-centered confidence). By contrast, participants with low trait curiosity were least
curious in trials with low confidence but became more curious with increasing confidence. For them,
SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 33
the relationship between confidence and curiosity ratings took the form of a positive linear relationship
instead. Thus, it appears that the finding that curiosity is highest for information with moderate
complexity might not be true for everyone.
Why do participants with different levels of trait curiosity react differently to experiencing low
confidence? Higher levels of trait curiosity are associated with a greater appreciation for cognitive
effort (Cacioppo & Petty, 1982; Mussel, 2013). As a result, situations perceived as complex or
ambiguous may be approached rather than avoided (Kashdan & Steger, 2007), leading more curious
participants to report a desire to see the answers they are uncertain about. Across two studies where
participants had to rate their curiosity about poems or pictures, Silvia (2008) found that the effect of
trait curiosity on momentary curiosity was fully mediated by participants’ appraisals of whether they
were able to comprehend the object. Similar to the present findings in which the effect of trait
curiosity could be observed only in ambiguous situations in which participants had low confidence in
the answer, the mediation effect of participants’ appraisal of coping potential in the study by Silvia
(2008) was seen only with complex stimuli but not for simple stimuli. This finding has important
implications for educational practice, where teachers may try to trigger students’ curiosity by
highlighting knowledge gaps or presenting surprising facts or open-ended questions (Grossnickle
Peterson, 2020; Lamnina & Chase, 2019). Whereas this strategy may successfully spark state curiosity
in highly curious students, it could overwhelm students with lower trait curiosity (Kashdan et al.,
2018; Lavrijsen et al., in press). Thus, interventions aimed at triggering curiosity might not have the
same effect on all students and may require personalized instructional practices to be effective across
different levels of trait curiosity.
With respect to the interaction between confidence and reading time, interestingly, trials with
very high and very low confidence ratings showed similar patterns, distinct from trials with moderate
confidence. In trials with very high or low confidence, there was a positive quadratic relationship
between reading time and curiosity ratings. This finding means that, in those trials, both very short and
very long reading times were associated with higher curiosity ratings, whereas average reading times
were linked to lower curiosity ratings. By contrast, for trials with moderate confidence, reading time
appeared to have a minimal impact on curiosity ratings. We can only speculate about the reasons for
SELF-DIRECTED INFORMATION SEEKING AND CURIOSITY 34
this pattern. As previously mentioned when discussing the quadratic relationship between reading time
and state curiosity ratings, particularly long reading times could reflect either sustained interest or
confusion (Gwizdka & Spence, 2007; Hidi & Renninger, 2019). Trials in which participants reported
low confidence despite a long reading time may indicate confusion, whereas high confidence paired
with long reading times could signal greater interest. For trials with particularly short reading times,
participants likely clicked on the hyperlink but quickly returned to the main text without processing
any information. This fleeting exposure may then have sparked a desire to revisit the information
when given the opportunity on the knowledge test. By contrast, for trials with low reading time and
high confidence, participants may have already known the answer before reading the text, and their
curiosity to learn the answer might have stemmed from a desire to confirm their prior knowledge.
However, strong claims about these effects would be premature, as this type of experimental set-up
has not been tested before. Still, our findings highlight the promise of further exploring the interplay
between engagement, confidence, and curiosity in future research. It is possible that degree of success
from acquiring knowledge via information seeking (as reflected by the confidence in one’s answers)
influences subsequent curiosity. For example, a learner may demonstrate high engagement with
information, such as spending a long time reading, yet they may still struggle to successfully acquire
knowledge. This scenario could lead to increased curiosity about the topic later on or, conversely,
result in frustration and diminished curiosity (Di Leo et al., 2019).
Lastly, we tested factors affecting participants’ likelihood of answering a question correctly
(Stankov & Lee, 2008). We found that in trials in which participants reported greater confidence, they
were more likely to answer correctly. This finding indicates that participants’ metacognitive awareness
of their knowledge levels was fairly accurate. Notably, when predicting performance, the scaling
approach for confidence did not affect the results. Furthermore, we tested for whether self-directed
information-seeking behavior during the free exploration phase affected performance. Both click and
reading time positively predicted performance, validating these two variables as meaningful indicators
of information seeking aimed at knowledge acquisition.

Limitations
Several limitations should be acknowledged. The knowledge test we administered mirrored
the trivia question task in that, for each question, participants were asked to indicate both their
confidence in their answer and their curiosity to learn the correct answer. However, there were also
several differences. First, we used multiple-choice rather than open-ended questions. The answer
format may have influenced participants’ behaviors (e.g., how much they deliberated on their answers)
and potentially their curiosity to learn the correct answer. Furthermore, whereas the knowledge test
questions covered various aspects of the topic, and some were only loosely connected (e.g.,
information on the Pacific Ocean vs. Dwight D. Eisenhower), they were all related to the overall topic
of the Panama Canal. This approach is in contrast to the trivia questions, which are often drawn from
standardized pools and are not related to each other (Fastrich et al., 2018). We assume that the direct
effect of this interrelatedness on the curiosity and confidence ratings during the knowledge test was
likely to be minimal. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that reading one hyperlink during the
free exploration phase may affect the selection of the next, something that cannot be fully controlled
for experimentally. As a result, some links may have been read together more frequently, indirectly
affecting the confidence and curiosity ratings. Nonetheless, learning about a coherent topic better
reflects real-world learning situations, highlighting the trade-off between using clearly separated items
and more naturalistic materials.
Whereas we included many well-established constructs from curiosity research, there are
several additional variables that have been considered in previous studies using the trivia question
task. Some of these constructs are assessed before the answer is revealed, for example, a feeling-of-
knowing (Litman et al., 2005) and tip-of-the tongue states (Metcalfe et al., 2017), or the perceived
importance of knowing the answer (Spitzer et al., 2024). Others pertain to how a person evaluates the
answer once it has been revealed, with previous research assessing reactions such as surprise (Baranes
et al., 2015; Ligneul et al., 2018), interest in the answer (Fastrich et al., 2018; McGillivray et al.,
2015), relief and pleasure (Jach et al., 2022), or confusion (Vogl et al., 2020). Future research could be
enriched by additionally considering these variables and investigating how they interact with one
another and with the variables included in our study.

Lastly, we measured only short-term knowledge acquisition, as the knowledge test was
administered immediately after participants finished reading the hypertext. However, many studies
have demonstrated that curiosity enhances memory retention, even after time delays (Fastrich et al.,
2018; Kang et al., 2009; Lyew et al., 2023; Marvin & Shohamy, 2016; McGillivray et al., 2015;
Murayama & Kuhbandner, 2011; Stare et al., 2018; Swirsky et al., 2021). Thus, incorporating a
follow-up knowledge test in this experimental set-up could be valuable, especially for examining how
reading time, as a proxy for engagement, affects both short-term and long-term knowledge acquisition.
Furthermore, reassessing participants’ curiosity to learn the answers during the follow-up could
provide additional insights into how curiosity evolves over time and how it is related to knowledge
retention. For example, one might intuitively expect a participant to be particularly curious about a
question that they used to know the answer to in the first knowledge test but they cannot remember in
the follow-up.
Conclusion
How did the Pacific Ocean get its name? What was the Panama conflict? Who was Ferdinand
de Lesseps? To learn something new, people must often be intrinsically motivated and must engage in
self-directed information seeking to satisfy their curiosity. In an online study, we investigated the self-
directed information seeking of participants who read a hypertext and the interplay of information
seeking with trait curiosity and subsequent self-reported confidence and curiosity. We found that the
degree of engagement in information seeking—measured by reading time—was a significant predictor
of later curiosity ratings, whereas the mere decision to seek additional information (i.e., click on a
hyperlink) was not. Furthermore, the relationship between confidence and curiosity about a specific
piece of information was influenced by a person’s trait curiosity, especially in instances of low
confidence. This study introduced a promising experimental set-up for studying intrinsically motivated
information seeking as a more naturalistic behavioral measure of curiosity while maintaining
experimental control and provides new insights into the dynamic processes of how curiosity emerges,
evolves, and is satisfied.
