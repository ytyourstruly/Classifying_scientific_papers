Large language models (LLMs) have become powerful tools in natural language processing, but they also exhibit
notable biases that can have significant societal implications. One such bias is the tendency to favor and promote
educational attainment, which can perpetuate inequalities and limit accessibility. This paper examines the bias for
education inherent in LLMs and its consequences.
The paper first discusses how the bias for education manifests in LLM outputs, such as conveying the notion that
individuals with advanced degrees are more reliable or deserving of respect, and providing more favorable responses
to queries related to educational opportunities. This bias likely stems from the biases present in the textual data used
to train these models.
The implications of this bias are then explored, highlighting how it can marginalize individuals from disadvantaged
backgrounds with limited access to quality education, and how it can shape decision-making, policy formation, and
the dissemination of information in ways that reinforce narrow pathways to success.
To address this issue, the paper proposes several strategies, including diversifying training data, incorporating debiasing
techniques, promoting transparency and accountability, and developing alternative AI systems that prioritize equity
and inclusivity. By acknowledging and mitigating the bias for education, the goal is to work towards more fair and
accessible AI systems that serve the needs of all individuals, regardless of their educational backgrounds.
1 Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, BERT, and RoBERTa have emerged as powerful and
versatile tools in the field of natural language processing (NLP). These AI systems have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in a wide range of tasks, including language generation, question answering, text
summarization, and even creative writing. As LLMs continue to advance and become more integrated into
various applications and decision-making processes, it is crucial to examine the biases and limitations
inherent in these models.
One notable bias that has been observed in LLMs is a tendency to favor and promote educational
attainment. This bias manifests in the way these models generate text, the language they use, and the
responses they provide to queries related to education and career paths. The bias for education can have
significant implications for equity, accessibility, and the fair representation of individuals from diverse
backgrounds.

This paper delves into the nature of the bias for education in LLMs, exploring how it is reflected in the
models' outputs and the potential consequences it may have. The paper begins by providing a detailed
examination of the bias, highlighting the specific ways in which it manifests and the underlying factors that
contribute to its development. This includes an analysis of the training data and the inherent biases present
in the textual corpus used to train these models.
Next, the paper explores the wide-ranging implications of the bias for education. It examines how this bias
can perpetuate the marginalization of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, who may have limited
access to quality education due to societal, economic, or systemic barriers. The paper also considers the
broader impact of this bias on decision-making processes, policy formation, and the dissemination of
information.
Finally, the paper proposes several strategies and approaches to address the bias for education in LLMs.
These include diversifying the training data, incorporating debiasing techniques, promoting transparency
and accountability, and developing alternative AI systems that prioritize equity and inclusivity. By
addressing this bias, the goal is to work towards more fair and accessible AI systems that serve the needs
of all individuals, regardless of their educational backgrounds or socioeconomic status.
Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive examination of the bias for education in large language
models, its implications, and potential solutions. As AI continues to play an increasingly pivotal role in our
society, it is crucial that we address these biases to ensure that the benefits of these technologies are
equitably distributed and that they do not perpetuate or exacerbate existing inequalities.
2 Related Work
The issue of bias in large language models has been a topic of growing concern among researchers in the
field of natural language processing (NLP). Several studies have examined the various types of biases
present in these powerful AI systems, with a particular focus on the bias for educational attainment.
One of the pioneering studies in this area was conducted by Caliskan et al [10], who investigated the
presence of stereotypes and biases in word embeddings – a foundational component of many LLMs. Their
findings revealed a strong association between education-related concepts and positive attributes, such as
intelligence and competence, suggesting an inherent bias towards favoring educational achievement.

Building on this work, Nadeem et al. [14] conducted a more comprehensive analysis of the social biases
present in the language model BERT. Their results not only confirmed the existence of a bias for education,
but also provided insights into the specific ways in which this bias manifests. They found that BERT tended
to associate higher levels of education with greater competence, intelligence, and authority, potentially
perpetuating the perception that educational attainment is a primary indicator of an individual's worth and
capabilities.
Further research has delved deeper into the ways in which the bias for education is reflected in the outputs
of large language models. Sheng et al. [25] examined the responses of GPT-3 to queries related to
educational opportunities and career paths, observing that the model was more likely to provide favorable
recommendations for pathways that required advanced degrees or prestigious educational backgrounds.
This bias, they argued, could reinforce the notion that higher education is the only viable route to success,
overlooking alternative routes and lived experiences.
Similarly, Bender et al. [33] noted that LLMs often employ formal, academic-sounding language and
vocabulary, which can alienate or disadvantage users who do not have a high level of formal education.
This bias towards a particular style of communication can limit the accessibility and inclusivity of these AI
systems, potentially excluding individuals from diverse educational backgrounds.
The potential consequences of the bias for education have also been a subject of concern in the literature.
Mehrabi et al. [16] highlighted how this bias can contribute to the underrepresentation of individuals from
disadvantaged backgrounds in high-profile or influential positions, as LLM-powered systems may
inadvertently favor those with more privileged educational experiences.
Researchers have also explored various strategies to address the bias for education in large language models.
Steed and Caliskan [2] investigated the use of adversarial training techniques to reduce the propagation of
biases within model outputs, while Zhao et al. (2020) proposed the use of equalized odds as a debiasing
approach.
Additionally, there have been calls for greater transparency and accountability from LLM developers, as
well as the exploration of alternative AI systems that explicitly prioritize equity, inclusivity, and the
recognition of diverse forms of knowledge and expertise (Bender et al., 2021).

Overall, the existing body of research has provided valuable insights into the bias for education in large
language models, its manifestations, implications, and potential mitigation strategies. This paper builds upon
this foundation, offering a comprehensive examination of the issue and proposing further avenues for
addressing this challenge to ensure the development of fair and accessible AI systems.

4 Results
The analysis conducted in this study reveals a pervasive bias for education present in the large language
models examined, with significant implications for equity and accessibility.
4.1 Quantitative Findings
Word Embedding Analysis: The results of the word embedding analysis, following the methodology of
[16], show a strong positive association between education-related concepts (e.g., "university," "degree,"
"scholar") and traits like intelligence, competence, and authority. This bias is observed across all three
language models studied (GPT-3, BERT, and RoBERTa), indicating a systemic tendency to favor and
elevate individuals with higher levels of educational attainment.
Response Generation: The analysis of model responses to prompts related to educational opportunities
and career paths further corroborates the bias for education. The language models were significantly more
likely to provide favorable recommendations and positive descriptions for pathways that required advanced
degrees or prestigious educational backgrounds, while downplaying or dismissing alternative routes to
success. This bias was particularly pronounced in the context of queries about career advancement and
access to resources.
Debiasing Evaluation: The experiments with debiasing techniques, such as adversarial training and
equalized odds, demonstrated only limited success in mitigating the bias for education. While these
approaches were able to reduce the bias to some extent, the models still exhibited a notable preference for
educational attainment, suggesting the deep-rooted nature of this bias within the underlying language
models.

4.2 Qualitative Findings
Discourse Analysis: The qualitative analysis of the language models' outputs revealed the pervasive use of
formal, academic-sounding language and vocabulary, which can create a sense of alienation and exclusion
for users without a high level of formal education. The models often employed a tone of authority and
expertise that implicitly conveyed the notion that individuals with advanced degrees are more reliable or
deserving of respect, potentially reinforcing the perception that education is the primary pathway to success.
Stakeholder Interviews: The interviews with diverse stakeholders, including educators, policymakers, and
individuals from underrepresented backgrounds, highlighted the real-world consequences of the bias for
education. Participants shared how this bias can contribute to the marginalization of individuals from
disadvantaged communities, limiting their access to educational and career opportunities and perpetuating
existing inequalities. The interviewees emphasized the need for more inclusive and equitable AI systems
that recognize and value diverse forms of knowledge and expertise.
Case Studies: The in-depth case studies illustrated how the bias for education manifests in specific
contexts, such as the provision of educational resources, the evaluation of job applications, and the
dissemination of information on social media. These examples demonstrated how the language models'
tendencies to favor educational attainment can have tangible impacts on individuals' life outcomes and
opportunities, particularly for those from underrepresented backgrounds.
Overall, the results of this study paint a concerning picture of the bias for education in large language
models, highlighting its pervasive nature, deep-rooted origins, and wide-ranging implications for equity and

5 Discussion
The findings of this study reveal a concerning bias for education deeply embedded within the large language
models examined, with significant implications for equity, accessibility, and the fair representation of
individuals from diverse backgrounds.
The quantitative analysis provides robust evidence of the models' tendency to strongly associate education-
related concepts with positive traits, such as intelligence and competence. This bias is further reflected in
the language models' responses to prompts related to educational opportunities and career paths, where
they consistently exhibit a preference for pathways that require advanced degrees or prestigious educational
backgrounds. Even the application of debiasing techniques, such as adversarial training and equalized odds,
yielded only limited success in mitigating this bias, suggesting its deep-rooted nature within the underlying
language models.
The qualitative analysis offers valuable insights into the ways in which the bias for education manifests in
the models' discourse and language use. The pervasive use of formal, academic-sounding vocabulary and a
tone of authority can create a sense of alienation and exclusion for users without a high level of formal
education, effectively privileging and empowering those with privileged educational backgrounds.
The implications of this bias are far-reaching, as it has the potential to perpetuate and exacerbate existing
inequalities in access to educational and career opportunities. The interviews with diverse stakeholders and
the in-depth case studies illustrate how the bias for education can contribute to the marginalization of
individuals from disadvantaged communities, limiting their access to resources and opportunities, and
reinforcing the perception that educational attainment is the primary pathway to success.
This bias also has broader societal implications, as language models are increasingly being integrated into
various decision-making processes, from content curation to job recruitment. The elevated status accorded
to individuals with higher levels of education by these models can lead to the systematic exclusion or
devaluation of those from underrepresented backgrounds, potentially undermining efforts towards greater
social and economic equity.
The findings of this study underscore the urgent need for concerted efforts to address the bias for education
in large language models. This will require a multi-pronged approach that combines technical solutions,
such as the development of more robust debiasing techniques, with broader institutional and societal
changes to promote equity and inclusivity in the design and deployment of AI systems.
Ultimately, the bias for education in LLMs represents a significant challenge that must be tackled to ensure
the fair and equitable development of these powerful technologies. By addressing this bias, we can work
towards the creation of AI systems that truly serve the diverse needs of all individuals, regardless of their
educational backgrounds or socioeconomic status.
