30 Abstract
31 Purpose
32 While research shows associations between recent stressful experiences (RSEs) and perinatal mental illness,
33 potential moderators and relationships to well-being are not yet understood. The current study aimed to examine (1)
34 if sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) moderated the relationship between RSEs and prenatal mental illness and
35 well-being and (2) if results supported a diathesis-stress (i.e., high SPS individuals are more likely to have mental
36 illness when experiencing RSEs) or a differential susceptibility (i.e., high SPS individuals are more likely to have
37 less mental illness/more well-being when experiencing few RSEs) model.
38 Methods
39 Participants included 574 pregnant individuals in their first trimester recruited via social media advertisements
40 followed by videocalls who were (1) 18+ years old (2) literate in English (3) US citizens/residents, and (4) planning
41 to continue the pregnancy. Participants self-reported mental illness (depression and anxiety symptoms) and well-
42 being (life satisfaction), RSEs, and SPS. Moderated path analyses and region-of-significance analyses were
43 conducted in Mplus.
44 Results
45 A significant interaction was found between RSEs and SPS in the prediction of depression symptoms but not anxiety
46 or life satisfaction. Simple slopes showed that RSEs predicted depression symptoms when SPS was high only.
47 Region-of-significance analyses showed strong support for the diathesis-stress model, identifying SPS as a
48 vulnerability factor for perinatal depression.
49 Conclusion
50 The present study found that SPS was a vulnerability factor for depression in pregnant individuals. Screening and
51 awareness of SPS could support more precise and effective mental health care based on research showing therapy
52 can be tailored for individuals high on SPS.
54 Keywords: Recent stressful experiences; sensory processing sensitivity; perinatal mental health; perinatal well-

56 Article Highlights
57 • Experiencing more recent stressful experiences was associated with poorer mental health in pregnant
58 individuals.
59 • Recent stressful experiences were associated with both mental illness and well-being during pregnancy.
60 • The study highlights perinatal mental health as a continuum including both positive and negative facets.
61 • Pregnant individuals high on sensory processing sensitivity were found to be more sensitive to stressful events.
62 Sensory processing sensitivity (highly sensitive personality) acted as a vulnerability to stress in pregnant
63 individuals.
64 Introduction
65 Perinatal mental illness is a significant concern as rates of clinically concerning depression and anxiety symptoms in
66 pregnant individuals reach 20-30% (Dennis et al., 2017; Gavin et al., 2005). The consequences of mental health
67 disorders for pregnant individuals include lower quality of life, poor household functioning, relationship difficulties,
68 and suicidal ideation - as well as negative impacts after birth for the child, including impaired attachment, and poor
69 behavioral, cognitive, and social outcomes (Slomian et al., 2019). While the literature often focuses on the presence
70 of psychopathology, there is a lack of consideration for perinatal well-being. From a hedonic viewpoint, mental
71 well-being consists of several facets, including happiness, positive affect, and life satisfaction (Diener, 1984). It is
72 important to consider both mental well-being and mental illness as they are connected but distinct realms of mental
73 health (Badri et al., 2022; Beiser, 1974), with well-being being uniquely associated with physical health, prosocial
74 behavior, and flexible thinking (Huppert, 2009). There is an increasing emphasis on including mental well-being for
75 prevention and treatment as it can differentiate subtle intricacies of how individuals are feeling compared to
76 exclusively measuring psychopathology (Greenspoon & Saklofske, 2001). As such, understanding predictors of both
77 mental illness and well-being could help better support perinatal mental health.
78 When considering vulnerability during perinatal life transitions, the consideration of current environments
79 is important. Previous research found positive associations between recent stressful experiences (RSEs) and
80 perinatal depression and anxiety. Specifically, studies found that the prevalence of perinatal anxiety and depressive
81 symptoms was higher as the number of RSEs increased, indicating a dose-response relationship (Hou et al., 2023;
82 Salm Ward et al., 2017; Stone et al., 2015). To our knowledge the current literature has yet to consider RSEs and its
83 link to well-being within both a general adult population and pregnant population. Furthermore, while several
84 studies show a link between cumulative RSEs and perinatal mental illness, a systematic review found that within 21
85 studies, only half observed associations between prenatal RSEs and postpartum depressive symptoms (Yim et al.,
86 2015). Despite this mixed evidence, there was a lack of studies examining potential moderating factors, and
87 examining individual characteristics was recommended based on the diathesis-stress model (Yim et al., 2015).
88 Examining these moderating factors could help understand specifically who RSEs impact most, in turn helping
89 understand mixed results on main effects.
90 One individual characteristic that can moderate the effect of the environment on mental health is sensory
91 processing sensitivity (SPS), also known as highly sensitive personality - a trait capturing individuals’ perception,
92 responses, and sensitivity to their social and physical environment (Aron et al., 2012). Those with a higher
93 sensitivity detect more subtle environmental differences and respond to a lower level of stimuli (Aron & Aron,
94 1997). Positive correlations have been found between SPS and anxiety and depression (Liss et al., 2005). However,
95 research has yet to examine this relationship within the context of perinatal well-being as well as consider SPS as a
96 moderating factor between RSEs and perinatal mental health.
97 In examining such person-environment interactions, the diathesis-stress and differential susceptibility
98 models propose different interaction patterns. The diathesis-stress model (Fig 1) proposes that individuals have
99 inherent vulnerabilities (diatheses) that make them more likely to experience poor mental health when faced with
100 negative environments (stressors) (Monroe & Simons, 1991). Following this model, those high in SPS would be
101 more likely than those low in SPS to have poor mental health (high mental illness and/or low mental well-being)
102 when experiencing RSEs. In contrast, the differential susceptibility model (Fig 1) suggests that instead of
103 vulnerability, some individuals are more susceptible to both negative and positive environments, or even the absence
104 of adversity (Belsky & Pluess, 2009). For example, pregnant individuals with high SPS may be more vulnerable to
105 poor mental health when experiencing RSEs but may also be prone to high mental health (low mental illness and/or
106 high mental well-being) than their peers when experiencing few RSEs. Examining these models could contribute to
107 improving perinatal prevention and treatment options, as differences in environmental sensitivity have been shown
108 to impact treatment response (de Villiers et al., 2018).

112 Objectives
113 The current study aimed to examine (1) if SPS moderated the association between RSEs and mental illness
114 (depression, anxiety) and well-being (life satisfaction) during the first trimester of pregnancy as a key transition of
115 the perinatal period and (2) if interaction patterns supported diathesis-stress or differential susceptibility.

118 Participants are from the Experiences of Pregnancy cohort study. Detailed recruitment strategies are
119 described in the cohort’s protocol (Rioux et al., 2023) and in (Childers-Rockey et al., 2024). Pregnant individuals in
120 their first trimester of pregnancy were recruited via social media advertisements followed by eligibility Zoom calls
121 between June and August 2023. Participants had to be 18+ years of age, comfortable reading and writing in English,
122 live in and be permanent residents or citizens of the United States, and planning continue their pregnancy. Eligible
123 participants completed questionnaires through REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). 574 eligible
124 participants filled out the first trimester survey. All participants had data on at least one study variable thus the full

129 Measures
130 Mental illness
131 Depression symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (Kroenke et al., 2001).
132 Items assess depression symptoms over the last two weeks, rated on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every
133 day). Sum scores were computed, and these continuous scores were used in the main analyses. Reliability was good
134 in this sample (Cronbach’s a = .84). The scale’s established cut-off scores (Kroenke et al., 2001) are of 10 for
135 moderate depression, 15 for moderately severe depression, and 20 for severe depression.
136 Anxiety symptoms were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (Spitzer et al.,
137 2006). Items assess general anxiety symptoms over the last two weeks, rated on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3
138 (nearly every day). Sum scores were computed, and these continuous scores were used in the main analyses.
139 Reliability was good in this sample (Cronbach’s a = .90). The scale’s established cut-off scores (Spitzer et al., 2006)
140 are of 10 for moderate anxiety and 15 for severe anxiety.
141 Mental well-being
142 Life satisfaction was measured using the PROMIS® General Life Satisfaction – Short Form 5a (Vaughan et
143 al., 2020). Items are rated on a scale from 0 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Sum scores were computed,
144 and these continuous scores were used in the main analyses. Higher scores represent higher levels of life
145 satisfaction. Reliability was good in this sample (Cronbach’s a = .88).
146 Recent stressful experiences
147 Cumulative exposure to RSEs was measured using the Recent Stressful Experiences Checklist (Roos et al.,
148 2023). This measure is comprised of 10 “Yes” or “No” questions assessing the presence or absence of stressors in
150 range from 0 to 10.

Death of someone close to you 107 (18.6)
Life-threatening illness or accidental injury to you or someone close to you 77 (13.4)
Family violence or abuse to you or someone close to you 25 (4.4)
Moved to a different home or apartment 188 (32.8)

Anything else bad happened to you or someone close to you that upset you a lot 125 (21.8)
153 Sensory processing sensitivity
154 SPS was measured using the Highly Sensitive Person Scale-12 items (Pluess et al., 2023). Items are rated
155 on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely). Mean scores were computed. Reliability was acceptable in this sample
156 (Cronbach’s a = .76).
157 Covariates
158 Covariates included age, education level, marital status, and income-to-needs ratio (income divided by
159 number of people in the household).
160 Analyses
161 Moderated linear regressions (path analyses) were conducted using Mplus 8.6. Missing data rates were low,
162 ranging from 0.2% to 5.9% across variables and full information maximum likelihood (FIML) was used to account
163 for missing data. As models were saturated, model fit indices were not calculated.
164 Analyses were conducted separately for each outcome (i.e., depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, life
165 satisfaction) using the product-indicator approach (Frazier et al., 2004; Memon et al., 2019), where covariates,
166 RSEs, and SPS were included in the first model and the interaction terms of RSEs and SPS were added in the second
167 model. Predictor and moderator variables were standardized before computing interaction terms and entering
168 variables in the analysis. Testing for diathesis–stress and differential susceptibility requires the predictor and
169 moderator to be independent from each other (Belsky & Pluess, 2009). RSEs were mildly correlated with SPS (r =
170 0.12, p < 0.05), thus RSEs was regressed on SPS and the RSEs standardized residual score was used in analyses, as
171 is often done in studies testing the diathesis-stress and differential susceptibility models (Rioux et al., 2016). For
172 significant interactions, simple slope tests were conducted as a function of SPS at ± 1 standard deviation (SD).
173 The nature of the ordinal (fan-shaped) or disordinal (cross-over) interaction was formally tested for
174 diathesis–stress and differential susceptibility using three indices as recommended by Roisman et al. (2012) and
175 Giudice (2017). First, the “regions-of-significance” were identified using the Johnson–Neyman technique,
176 identifying the values of RSEs at which SPS is associated with the outcome. In other words, the regions-of-
177 significance test identifies where in the RSEs continuum participants high and low on SPS differ on the outcome. If
178 they only differ at the high end of RSEs, results support the diathesis–stress model (ordinal interaction). If they
179 differ at both the low and high end of RSEs, results support the differential susceptibility model (disordinal
180 interaction). Second, the “proportion affected” (PA) index was computed. This index represents the proportion of
181 participants who benefit from the positive environment, or the proportion of participants below the crossover point.
182 A prototypical differential susceptibility model would have a PA index of 0.50 and diathesis–stress 0.00. Within the
183 full continuum of values, a PA value below 0.16 is considered as indicative of diathesis–stress. Third and last, the
184 “proportion-of-interaction” (PoI) index was computed. This index represents the proportion of the total area of the
185 interaction that is due to the positive environment. A prototypical differential susceptibility model would have a PoI
186 of 0.50 and diathesis-stress 0.00. Within the full continuum of values, a PoI <0.20 is considered indicative of
187 diathesis-stress.
188 Results
189 Descriptive statistics
190 In the study sample, 17.5% had moderate and 11.8% had moderately severe or severe depression
191 symptoms. Anxiety prevalence was slightly lower, with 14.9% at moderate levels and 8.3% at severe levels.
192 Furthermore, 15.6% of participants had both moderate-to-severe depression symptoms and moderate-to-severe
193 anxiety symptoms (comorbid symptoms). RSEs ranged from 0 to 7. Correlations and descriptive statistics for the
195 showing positive associations with depression symptoms and anxiety symptoms and negative associations with life
196 satisfaction. Life satisfaction was negatively associated with anxiety symptoms and depression symptoms, and
197 anxiety symptoms and depression symptoms were positively associated.

210 Interaction effects
211 The interaction between RSEs and SPS was significant in the prediction of depression symptoms, but not
213 symptoms when SPS was high, but not when it was low (Fig 2). When both SPS and RSEs were high, depression
214 symptoms were above the moderately severe threshold (Fig 2).
215 Fig. 2 RSEs by SPS interaction predicting depressive symptoms in the first trimester of pregnancy.
216 The regions-of-significance analysis showed that participants with high levels of SPS had higher levels of
217 depression symptoms than those low in SPS at all observed values of RSEs, with no cross-over point. The PA and
218 PoI indexes were 0.00. Accordingly, all indices showed support for the diathesis-stress model.
219 Discussion
220 With previous literature finding mixed results when examining RSEs and its association to perinatal mental
221 illness (Yim et al., 2015), the current study aimed to examine whether SPS moderated this relationship within the
222 first trimester of pregnancy while also including mental well-being (life satisfaction) as a facet of mental health.
223 Further, a second objective aimed to test whether interaction patterns showed support for the diathesis-stress model
224 or differential susceptibility model.
225 Results for the main objective showed a significant interaction between RSEs and SPS in the prediction of
226 depression symptoms, but not for anxiety or life satisfaction. The number of RSEs experienced predicted depression
227 symptoms only when SPS was high. While SPS captures an individual’s perception of their environmental stimuli,
228 pregnancy can be an especially vulnerable milestone for individuals as it requires a high degree of adaption to both
229 physical and emotional changes (Allan et al., 2013). More specifically, while pregnancy may introduce visual, taste,
230 and olfactory sensory changes (Geurdes, 2022; Li et al., 2020), it is important to consider whether these changes
231 may be more profound or overwhelming to highly sensitive persons. Thus, the combination of high SPS and
232 pregnancy may create a “perfect storm” in which SPS is heightened during pregnancy and associated with a
233 particularly high risk for poorer mental health. This could be examined in future research where sensitivity to RSEs
234 would be compared longitudinally in predicting mental health during and before and/or after pregnancy.
235 The present study found that high SPS individuals did not have lower levels of depression when
236 experiencing few RSEs as suggested by the differential susceptibility model. Rather, this interaction supported the
237 diathesis-stress model, suggesting SPS is a vulnerability trait for pregnant individuals experiencing RSEs where high
238 SPS individuals would be more heavily impacted by the stressful experiences that they have encountered. The
239 results of the present study along with the increasing evidence for high environmental sensitivity in SPS individuals’
240 (Aron & Aron, 1997; Liss et al., 2005; Slagt et al., 2018) suggest that SPS may be a factor to take into consideration
241 in the treatment and prevention of perinatal mental health problems. It has been strongly recommended that pregnant
242 individuals should be screened for mood disorders (Khajehei, 2015) and individuals can be further screened for SPS
243 (Smith et al., 2019) to better assess risk and/or individualize treatment. In treatment, it is suggested that SPS can be
244 integrated into mindfulness therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy, where
245 individuals would learn to acknowledge their temperament, accept rather than avoid their temperament, and
246 challenge internalized societal messages surrounding their temperament, respectively (Smith et al., 2019).
247 While SPS did not moderate the effect of RSEs in the prediction of anxiety symptoms and life satisfaction,
248 main effects were significant. Indeed, RSEs predicted anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and lower life
249 satisfaction. This supports previous links found between RSEs and perinatal depression (Hou et al., 2023) while
250 extending these results to anxiety and mental well-being. Similarly, results showed associations between SPS and
251 depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and lower levels of life satisfaction. This supports that the links that have
252 been repeatedly found between SPS and anxiety and depression in general adult populations (Liss et al., 2005;
253 Serafini et al., 2017) are also present in pregnancy. As with RSEs, it further extends the literature on SPS and mental
254 illness to mental well-being. The extension of findings on the predictors of mental illness to facets of mental well-
255 being is important as both are needed to justly capture the intricacies of mental health. While psychopathology is
256 indeed an important focal point when considering mental health, it is limited in its ability to demonstrate the
257 presence, absence, and level of positive psychology of individuals. Indeed, individuals may experience low levels of
258 well-being even in the absence of psychopathology (Westerhof & Keyes, 2010), and each are vital components of
259 mental health.
260 Limitations of the present study should be taken into consideration. While the current sample included
261 diverse individuals from various sociodemographic backgrounds, our sample was less representative than the
262 general population in both racial/ethnic backgrounds and educational attainment. The majority of our sample was
263 White (77.5%) and held either a bachelors (31.4%) or masters (36.6%) degree. The use of a cross-sectional design
264 limits conclusions about the directionality of effects. All measures were self-reported, thus shared method variance
265 may account for a portion of the associations. Although self-reports have been shown to be reliable in measuring
266 SPS (Pluess et al., 2023) and mental health (Kroenke et al., 2001; Spitzer et al., 2006) as partly subjective
267 experiences, studies including clinical assessments would clarify the robustness of these findings. Further, the
268 diathesis-stress and differential susceptibility models are frequently examined without measuring positive and
269 negative outcomes (Stoltz et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2019), making the measurement of mental illness and well-being a
270 strength of this study. Still, while diathesis-stress was supported, differential susceptibility proposes individual
271 sensitivity to both a negative and positive environments, and the measure of RSEs is limited to adversity. Although
272 differential susceptibility to the absence of adversity has been found in previous studies (Bousman et al., 2017; Lei
273 et al., 2015; Lorber et al., 2013; Rioux et al., 2016; Somers et al., 2017; Xu & Cao, 2023), an environmental factor
274 that captures the full spectrum from positive to negative may have more power in detecting differential susceptibility
275 (Giudice, 2017). Thus, future research could measure positive life events in addition to stressful events. Overall, the
276 role of SPS as a vulnerability rather than susceptibility factor should be considered specific to the association
277 between RSEs and depression, as diathesis-stress and environmental sensitivity have been shown to be trait- and
278 context-specific rather than domain-general (Belsky et al., 2022; Hentges et al., 2023; Markovitch et al., 2023;
279 Markovitch & Knafo-Noam, 2021).
280 Conclusion
281 The current study found that pregnant individuals high in SPS had higher levels of depression symptoms
282 than their peers when experiencing many RSEs, in support of the diathesis-stress model. Future research should
283 consider the role of SPS in the context of perinatal mental health as it could inform SPS-focused clinical technique
284 adoption and implementation. Additionally, the current study found that life satisfaction was negatively predicted by
285 both RSEs and SPS, showing that RSEs and SPS predict the full range of mental health and not just
286 psychopathology.
