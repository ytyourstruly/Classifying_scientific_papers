Abstract This article presents a critical reinterpretation of the
concept of "drugs" in contemporary society, challenging the
traditional categorization that separates legal substances from
illegal ones. Through a multidisciplinary analysis incorporating
psychology, neuroscience, and sociology, it argues that drugs,
regardless of their legal status, are merely stimulatory
substances that serve as nutrients for both the mind and the
body. The need for stimulation is framed as a fundamental human
response to social discomfort, as described by Freud in The
Malaise of Civilization. From this perspective, both legal drugs
(such as coffee and tea) and illegal ones (such as psychedelics)
serve the same basic function: alleviating the anxiety inherent in
social and cultural tensions. The concept of soma in Aldous
Huxley's Brave New World is incorporated as a critique of how
consumer societies seek artificial pleasures to mitigate suffering.
Finally, the article offers a comparative analysis of different drugs
and their effects on the human psyche, suggesting that the future
of psychedelic drug legalization should be considered not only
from a medical standpoint but also from cultural and
philosophical perspectives. This study offers new insights into
the role of drugs in mental health and social wellbeing.

Introduction
In recent decades, the discussion surrounding drugs, particularly psychedelic
substances, has undergone a significant transformation. Once confined to the
dichotomy of legal vs. illegal, the conversation now encompasses a broader array of
perspectives, including psychological, sociological, and neurobiological viewpoints.
This shift in understanding is often referred to as "revisionism psychedelic," as it
challenges traditional narratives about the harmfulness of these substances.
Emerging research suggests that drugs, regardless of their legal status, share a
common role in addressing the universal human need for stimulation, often seen as a
coping mechanism for societal discomfort. In this light, both legal substances like
1 de 3
caffeine and illegal psychedelics serve similar functions, providing temporary relief
from the anxiety and malaise inherent in modern culture. This article aims to explore
these new insights, with an emphasis on the cultural, philosophical, and therapeutic
implications of psychedelic substances in the context of a society increasingly
reconsidering their potential for positive impact.
Methodology of the Article on Drugs
This article follows a multidisciplinary approach, integrating various fields such as
psychology, neuroscience, sociology, and criminology to explore the complex
relationships between drug use, legalization, and societal control. The methodology
includes the following key components:
1. Literature Review: A comprehensive review of existing academic research,
including studies on psychedelics, drug policy, social control, and mental
health. The review also draws from historical and contemporary literature, such
as Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and George Orwell's 1984, to understand
the conceptual and cultural implications of drugs in society.
2. Qualitative Analysis: Through a critical interpretation, the article analyzes both
legal and illegal drugs as stimulatory substances, discussing their psychological
and social functions. This qualitative approach allows for the identification of
societal patterns and cultural norms that shape perceptions of drugs.
3. Comparative Study: The article conducts a comparative analysis of different
substances (such as coffee, tea, alcohol, and psychedelics), examining their
effects on mental health and social well-being. This section compares the
therapeutic benefits and risks associated with these substances, grounded in
both scientific findings and cultural interpretations.
4. Sociopolitical Analysis: Using frameworks from sociology and criminology, the
article investigates the regulation of drugs in relation to social control. It
examines how political and economic forces influence drug laws and policies,
considering the role of legal structures in maintaining the status quo.
5. Philosophical Reflection: A philosophical exploration of the concept of
"invisible totalitarianism" is included, drawing from dystopian literature to
critique modern control mechanisms. This section discusses how societal
structures, through laws and regulations, shape individual freedoms and access
to psychological and emotional relief.

6. Empirical Data: Where applicable, empirical data from scientific studies,
including clinical trials and psychological research, are integrated to support the
claims made about the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. Data on the
efficacy of substances like psilocybin and MDMA in treating mental health
conditions like depression, PTSD, and addiction are presented.
7. Case Studies and Real-World Examples: The methodology includes case
studies of regions or countries that have legalized or decriminalized certain
drugs, analyzing the societal and health outcomes of such policies. This
approach allows for an understanding of the broader implications of drug
legalization on public health and social dynamics.
8. Critical Theory: The article applies critical theory to question the dominant
narratives around drugs, advocating for a reevaluation of their legal status and
their potential for social and personal transformation. The focus is on the power
dynamics involved in the criminalization and regulation of substances.
This methodology is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role
drugs play in contemporary society, highlighting the need for more informed, open
discussions on their legalization and therapeutic potential.

Topic of the articles
The "Invisible Totalitarianism": The Hidden Control in Modern Society
Drawing from Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and George Orwell's 1984, this article
introduces the concept of "invisible totalitarianism." While totalitarian regimes are
often imagined as overtly authoritarian, the reality in modern societies is far subtler.
Huxley's soma in Brave New World symbolizes a method of state control disguised as
a tool for pleasure and escape. In a similar vein, modern societies regulate access to
psychedelics, controlling their distribution and legal status to maintain a manipulated
version of social order. Unlike the overt repression of Orwell's 1984, where all pleasures
are prohibited, the modern system of "invisible totalitarianism" allows for selective
access to pleasure and knowledge, with the intention of preserving the status quo.
In this sense, the "invisible totalitarianism" manifests through the regulation of
substances that could potentially liberate individuals from psychological suffering,
such as psychedelics. The political and social powers that regulate these substances,
framing them as "dangerous" or "unnatural," are engaged in a covert form of control.
This regulation serves not only to maintain social order but also to restrict the
individual's access to tools that could promote personal freedom and mental well-
being.
The Role of Psychedelics in Criminology and Law
The legal status of psychedelics provides another angle for understanding the
mechanisms of control within society. From a legal perspective, these substances have
been criminalized for their perceived risks to individual and collective behavior.
However, as scientific research begins to highlight their therapeutic potential, the
legitimacy of such prohibitions is increasingly questioned. Studies have shown that
psychedelics, including psilocybin and MDMA, can be highly effective in treating
conditions like depression, PTSD, and addiction (Griffiths et al., 2016; Carhart-Harris et
al., 2012). This contradiction between scientific evidence and legal status points to a
deeper issue: the use of laws to control access to substances that could challenge the
prevailing order.
The "invisible totalitarianism" is reflected in legal systems that continue to restrict
access to these substances despite growing evidence of their benefits. The laws
surrounding psychedelics illustrate how political and social structures can inhibit
access to knowledge and healing, particularly when it threatens established power
1 de 15
dynamics. If psychedelics were to be legalized, it would not just represent a shift in drug
policy but could also signify a broader reconfiguration of social norms and personal
freedoms.
The Freedom of the Mind and the Truth Behind Psychedelic Drugs
The debate over whether psychedelic drugs are inherently "good" or "bad" overlooks the
underlying issue of control: who decides what substances individuals can use to
alleviate their suffering? As Freud suggested in his work on cocaine use, the human
instinct is to seek relief from social and psychological discomfort, and the
consumption of drugs is a natural response to this need. However, the discourse
surrounding drugs is often shaped by political and social agendas that seek to limit or
suppress the individual's access to potential remedies for psychological distress.
The "invisible totalitarianism" operates through the creation of narratives that
delegitimize the therapeutic potential of psychedelics, positioning them as dangerous
or harmful despite mounting scientific evidence to the contrary. Just as in the dystopian
worlds of Huxley and Orwell, individuals are increasingly aware that their minds hold
the power to create new realities, challenging the dominant narratives that seek to
suppress their potential. The pursuit of psychedelic therapy could be the key to
unlocking this potential and dismantling the oppressive control imposed by societal
structures.

Conclusion
This article posits that the ongoing debate about psychedelics, framed within the
context of drug legalization and criminalization, is not simply about distinguishing
between "good" or "bad" substances. The real issue is the role that these substances
play in maintaining or challenging social and political control. The concept of "invisible
totalitarianism" highlights how the regulation of psychedelics is part of a larger system
of control, one that seeks to limit the freedom of individuals to heal and expand their
consciousness. By exploring the potential therapeutic benefits of psychedelics and
recognizing the historical and cultural forces that have shaped their legal status, this
paper advocates for a more open and informed discussion about the role of
psychedelics in contemporary society.
