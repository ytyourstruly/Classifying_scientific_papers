Abstract
This study uses longitudinal data to examine the educational performance—specifically self-
reported grades in Science, English, and Mathematics—of male and female students in Ghana
whose parents have either moved within the country or abroad. The study analyzes responses
from 741 secondary school students over the years 2013, 2014, and 2015. Findings indicate that
boys with at least one parent living internationally often attain grades that are similar to or better
than those of their counterparts from non-migrant families. On the other hand, girls from
migrant families typically do not exhibit significant differences in grades compared to girls
from non-migrant backgrounds. A key risk factor highlighted in the study is the detrimental
effect of parental divorce or separation on the academic outcomes of children from migrant
families.

INTRODUCTION
Many Ghanaian parents migrate to provide better living conditions for children and other family
members who remain in Ghana (Cebotari, 2020; Caarls, 2015). Estimates suggest that
approximately 1.5 million Ghanaians reside abroad, while as many as 8 million nationals have
migrated internally since the beginning of the century (Government of Ghana, 2016; Molini &
Paci, 2015). A significant number of these migrants are parents who frequently leave their
children behind in the care of either family or non-family members. It is estimated that almost
half of all Ghanaian children live without at least one biological parent, with girls having a
higher likelihood of living without a biological parent due to internal or international migration
(Azumah et al., 2018).
Extensive scholarly inquiries into the repercussions of parental migration on children's
educationa have yielded disparate conclusions. While some empirical studies indicate that in
some contexts the absence of parents due to migration can adversely associate with children's
education (Cortes, 2015; Hu, 2012; McKenzie and Rapoport, 2011), alternative research
underscores the potential benefits derived from migration, particularly when considering the
influx of monetary, in-kind, and social remittances on enhancing children’s educational
prospects (Antman, 2012; Cebotari, 2020; Rapoport and Docquier, 2006; Levitt, 1998). The
differing results emphasize the intricate consequences of parental migration on child wellbeing.
The evidence also underscore the significance of considering context-specific and dynamic
impacts on children’s education.
Drawing upon existing empirical insights, the present study adds to the scholarly discourse in
several ways. Primarily, it leverages panel data to elucidate the dynamic effects of parental
migration on the educational performance of children who stay behind. Given the distinctive
character of the employed dataset, this investigation stands as one of the first attempts to present
longitudinal evidence on the effects of parental migration on children’s education in Ghana
(although see Cebotari, Mazzucato and Appiah, 2018). Previous research into the effects of
parental migration on child education in Ghana has predominantly hinged on snapshot evidence
(see for instance, Karpati et al., 2021; Kyereko, 2020). Nevertheless, both migratory patterns
and educational outcomes manifest as evolving constructs, which are inadequately represented
by cross-sectional evidence. The data's panel format enables a more nuanced consideration of
the effects of migration on child education, addressing the unobserved heterogeneity that might
have been missed in prior African-context studies. Furthermore, we differentiate between
internal and international parental migration, taking into account other factors that might
influence child education, like the quality of the relationship with the caregiver and the marital
status of migrating parents. Consequently, this study adds to the existing literature by
emphasizing the intricacies of migration and family dynamics in the context of assessing child
education. Moreover, by examining the education of boys and girls, this research incorporates
a gendered lens into the analysis of child education in the context of migration. Scholarly works
from diverse geographical settings underscore the importance of accounting for child gender in
assessing educational outcomes (Antman 2012; Cebotari et al., 2018; Cortes 2015; Kyereko,
2020; McKenzie and Rapoport 2011). Presently, there is limited knowledge regarding the
educational disparities between boys and girls in the context of internal and international
parental migration. Lastly, in this study, the data is derived from child-reported measures
concerning migration and educational outcomes. The prevailing body of literature
predominantly harnesses adult reports to bolster empirical and theoretical assertions of child
well-being. Research indicates that children's self-reports regarding their educational outcomes
often diverge from those of adults (Jordan & Graham, 2012).
This study employs panel data collected in 2013, 2014, and 2015 from junior and senior high
school students in two Ghanaian urban areas with high out migration rates—Kumasi and
Syniani. We incorporate objective indicators, specifically the self-reported grades in English,
Mathematcis, and Science, to quantify educational outcomes. Beyond the characteristics of
parental migration, the analysis also delves into factors related to child and caregivers, living
conditions, and other measurements that influence school performance.
BACKGROUND
Temporal and financial investments represent two primary channels through which parents
allocate resources for their children (Thomson, Hanson, & McLanahan, 1994). In this context,
the implications of parental migration for children encompass both potential advantages and
challenges. As posited by the household strategy theory, parental migration serves as a tactical
approach to optimize the well-being of children and other kin who remain in the country of
origin (Stark & Bloom, 1985). Migrating parents bolster their family's economic standing
through remittance transfers. These monetary and material contributions elevate the
socioeconomic standing of children, fostering investments that facilitate their education. In the
context of the Philippines, research by Clemens and Tiongson (2013) elucidated the beneficial
ramifications of parental migration on children's educational outcomes, evidenced by an
increased propensity to enroll in private school and win educational awards. In the context of
Ghana, research by Cebotari (2020) indicated that children's educational outcomes are
enhanced when they are recipients of both in-kind and monetary remittances, particularly when
such remittances are invested in children’s educational needs. Conversely, studies focusing on
Mexican children have posited that the school performance of children in migrant households
tends to be adversely impacted (Lahaie et al., 2009; McKenzie and Rapoport, 2011). In
Zimbabwe, a study by Manyeruke et al. (2021) revealed that children of dual-migrant parents
exhibited diminished educational performance in comparison to their counterparts residing with
both parents. Notably, the same study discerned no significant disparities between children
whose mother or the father had embarked on migration (Manyeruke et al., 2021). An empirical
analysis in China found that children’s school performance is negatively affected when both
parents migrate, when the child is under the guardianship of a non-parental caregiver, or when
parents and children are separated for longer periods of time (Zhou et al., 2014).
The lack of presence of family members, leading to reduced oversight, guidance, and control,
can be detrimental to a child's education. The extent of this vulnerability largely depends on
which parent has migrated. Research has indicated that maternal migration can adversely affect
a child's school attainment (Lu 2014), school engagement (Wen and Lin 2012), and educational
performance (Dreby 2010). However, Battistella and Conaco (1998) observed that if the father
migrated and the mother remained at home, the children’s school performance was not
necessarily affected. Various studies also suggest that a child's education might not suffer due
to parental migration if appropriate care arrangements are established or if one parent stays
behind as the primary caregiver (Cebotari, 2018; Jordan and Graham 2012). Furthermore,
findings by Henderson and Mapp (2002) indicate that when one parent is actively involved in
a child's education, the child tends to have better grades, social skills, and classroom
participation. More comprehensive research is required to fully understand the impact of
parental migration on children’s educational outcomes in specific national contexts.
Much of the current research delves into international migration, while a significant number of
studies, especially within the context of China, focus on internal migration. The comparative
impact of internal versus international migration on children's education remains relatively
unexplored. Among the limited studies addressing this, one research comparing the effects of
both types of migration in Mexico and Indonesia discovered that international migration tends
to be more harmful to children's school attendance than internal migration (Lu, 2014). In Ghana,
studies revealed a similar trend: children with international migrant parents generally show
lower educational performance and school enjoyment compared to those with parents who
migrated within the country (Cebotari 2020, Cebotari and Mazzucato 2016). Internal migration,
being geographically closer, often entails fewer administrative and financial challenges, making
regular visits between parents and children more feasible. However, the potential for higher
earnings in international migration can directly impact the resources allocated for a child’s
education.
A limited number of studies have examined the educational outcomes of children based on
whether their migrating parents remain together or divorce. Research on migration in Ghana
indicates that the absence of a parent can strain marital relationships, particularly when women
migrate alone or when both parents migrate simultaneously (Caarls, 2015). When comparing
the effects of migration in a divorce-driven context with migration in a stable relationship
setting, researchers found that migrant fathers who are divorced frequently enter new
relationships and are more unwilling to provide financial support for their children who stay
behind (Dreby, 2010; Nobles, 2011). Similarly, Abrego (2009) compared divorced mothers and
fathers who were away due to migration and found that fathers were ore likely to reduce the
amount of remittances, or even stopped sending money to their children. Younger children,
boys, or those from wealthier households tend to receive more support from their divorced
fathers than older children, those from lower-income families, or girls (Landale and Oropesa,
2001). Moreover, Dreby (2010) found that Mexican children keep in touch significantly more
with fathers who have migrated than with fathers who are divorced. Another study highlighted
that children in single-parent households are typically left behind for more extended periods
than those in two-parent households (Eremenko and González-Ferrer, 2018). In Ghana, no
effect on school performance was observed for children whose parents migrated and divorced,
when only one parent had migrated, when children were in a stable care arrangement, or when
children received remittances (Cebotari and Mazzucato 2016). This evidence suggests that
divorce can significantly influence investments in children, potentially impacting their
educational outcomes.
The impact of gender on educational outcomes among children is a significant consideration
within the context of parental migration. The prevailing discourse often suggests that girls are
disproportionately disadvantaged by such migration. In Ghana, it is more common for girls to
change residences or fill labor gaps within the household when family members migrate (Caarls
et al., 2021; Karpati et al., 2021; Whitehead et al., 2007). A study conducted by Cebotari (2020)
found that a lack of remittances from internally migrating parents adversely affected Ghanaian
girls' enjoyment of school and academic ranking, an impact not observed among boys.
Conversely, studies in other regions present a more nuanced picture. Research from Vietnam
by Behrman and Knowles (1999) highlighted deteriorating academic outcomes for girls,
attributed to resource allocation favoring boys, particularly when financial support from abroad
is limited. However, studies focused on Mexico and China indicate a divergent trend: female
children were more likely to complete more years of education when family members migrated
(Hanson and Woodruff, 2003; Lu, 2012). Antman's study (2012) supported this view, positing
that international remittances from migrating fathers positively influenced the educational
trajectories of girls. This perspective is corroborated by additional findings from Nobles (2011)
in Mexico and Bouoiyour and Miftah (2016) in Morocco. This varied landscape of research
underscores the complexities involved in assessing the gender-specific impacts of parental
migration on educational outcomes of children, suggesting that contextual factors play a crucial
role.
Building upon existing scholarly works, the present research examines the gendered effects of
parental migration patterns on children's school performance. Using longitudinal data allows
for a more nuanced understanding of the time varying effects of migration on child education.
METHOD
Data
This study uses longitudinal data collected over three years (2013-2015) from children and
youths aged 12-21 in Kumasi and Sunyani—two Ghanaian urban centers with high out-
migration rates. Given the spatial concentration of migration patterns, a national sampling
strategy was eschewed in favor of an urban focus. Employing a stratified sampling method,
eight schools—varying in quality and type (public vs. private, junior vs. senior high schools)—
were chosen based on the Ministry of Education's annual rankings. The initial sample included
randomly selected classes wherein all students were surveyed, supplemented by purposive
sampling to ensure adequate representation of children with migrant backgrounds. These
cohorts were then tracked across subsequent survey rounds, guaranteeing a minimum of two
years of participation for each child in the panel.
Children were apprised of the study's goals and the voluntary nature of their involvement. The
questionnaire was self-administered in English under the supervision of a team of trained data
collection specialists. Attrition rates in the panel stand at 83% and 96% for junior high school
participants in the second and third rounds, respectively, and 82% and 85% for participants in
the senior high schools. Major causes of attrition were school changes and dropouts. Ultimately,
the analysis included only participants who had completed at least two rounds of the survey,
resulting in a final panel comprising 405 bi-round participants and 350 full-panel respondents.
Indicators
The three dependent variables in this study comprise the grades in Science, English, and
Mathematics. These grades, ranging from 1 to 100 with 100 being the highest attainable score,
serve as indicators of school performance.
The primary variable of interest in this research identifies the parent who has engaged in
migration—specifically categorizing instances where the child lives with both parents or where
the mother, the father, or both parents are absent due to internal or international migration.
Several control variables are incorporated to refine the analysis. The child's age is recorded in
complete years, while various family characteristics are operationalized as binary variables. For
instance, the caregiver's educational level is denoted as 1 if they have at least a secondary
education. Parental marital status is coded as 1 if the parents are divorced or separated, and the
stability of the child’s care arrangement is marked as 1 if the child has changed caregivers one
or more times subsequent to parental migration. Additionally, the duration of separation
between child and parent is classified into three categories: no separation, separation within the
last 12 months, and separation extending beyond 13 months.
Furthermore, a binary variable representing socioeconomic status serves as an indicator of the
child's relative living conditions (coded as 1 for better conditions compared to peers).
Additional measures account for the household composition, specifically the total number of
children and the number of younger siblings living with the child; these numbers include both
biological and non-biological siblings. A binary family process variable has also been
introduced to gauge the quality of the relationship between the child and the primary caregiver,
with a score of 1 indicating a distant relationship.
Interaction terms have been integrated into the analysis to explore the interplay between
parental marital status and various categories of migration, allowing for a nuanced
understanding of marital-specific variations in the context of migration over time.
Analysis
In the current research, a fixed-effects modeling approach is deployed to mitigate selection bias
while estimating causal relationships, effectively controlling for unobserved heterogeneity by
eliminating between-unit variations (Allison, 2009). This analytical strategy allows for the
examination of how temporal shifts in parental migration status and associated characteristics
correlate with variations in children's performance in main school subjects. Given the focus on
the time-varying aspect of the fixed-effects model, only variables that exhibit changes over the
study period are included.
The modeling procedure introduces sets of variables incrementally to scrutinize their
cumulative impact on children's grades in Science, English, and Mathematics. Although full
models are exclusively presented and discussed in this paper for the sake of conciseness,
stepwise regressions can be made available upon request. Separate models are included for each
of the three school subjects, who are further disaggregated by the child's gender. The division
of regressions by child gender and school subjects is informed by existing literature that points
to gender-specific educational disparities in Ghana, including in the context of parental
migration (Government of Ghana, 2019; Karpati et al., 2021; Cebotari and Mazzucato, 2016).
Each regression model estimates interaction terms between parental marital status and
migration categories. In the resulting tables, only statistically significant interactions are
reported. All models employ robust standard errors, which are corrected for clustering at the
individual level. Additionally, collinearity tests were conducted for all included indicators, with
no evidence of multicollinearity discovered.
RESULTS
of children in the sample slightly varies between boys and girls: girls have an average age of
15, whereas boys have an average age of 16. Regarding school performance, boys have mean
grades of 68 in Science, 65 in Math, and 67 in English. Comparatively, the girls’ mean grades
in Science, Math, and English are 62, 60, and 66, respectively.
Approximately half of the children in the dataset live with both parents—51% for boys and
47% for girls. It is relatively uncommon for children in the dataset to have a mother who has
migrated internationally; only 2.5% of girls and 3% of boys reported that their mother lives
abroad. In contrast, a somewhat higher percentage of mothers have migrated within Ghana—
7% for boys and 5% for girls. Fathers, however, are more likely to have migrated either
internally or internationally. Around 28% of boys and 32% of girls reported that their father has
migrated in either of the two settings. Girls experience internal migration of both parents more
frequently (11%) than boys (7.5%). The proportion of boys and girls with both parents
migrating internationally is 4% and 3%, respectively.
In cases of parental migration, approximately 24% of children, irrespective of gender, reported
that a parent has departed within the last 12 months. Over an extended period of separation,
girls are slightly more likely than boys to have not seen their parent(s) for more than 13 months.
Additionally, 11% of girls have changed caregivers more than once due to parental migration,
compared to 8% for boys.
One-third of children reported that their parents are divorced or separated, although the
percentage is slightly higher for boys (35%) than for girls (31%). Generally, more boys (87%)
reported having a better relationship with their caregivers than girls (74%). Most caregivers,
regardless of the child's gender, have not completed secondary education.
Boys and girls typically have three other siblings living with them, half of whom are younger.
Almost half of the boys (49%) and girls (48%) believe that their living conditions are better to
those of their peers.
In the subsequent phase of the analysis, we employ multivariate models to examine the time
varying effects of parental migration, along with other characteristics, on children's grades in
Science, Mathematics, and Science. Tables 2 and 3 present the full fixed-effects models
emerge with respect to the role of parental migration status and boys’ education. Within the
realm of Science, the international maternal migration is associated with a significant uptick in
boys’ scores (β = 16.29, Model 1). A similar, albeit more pronounced, effect is observed for
boys whose parents have both migrated internationally (β = 23.77), as compared to boys from
non-migrant families. In the context of Mathematics (Model 3), similar to Science, boys whose
mothers or both parents have migrated internationally are more likely to have higher scores in
Mathematics compared to boys living with non-migrant parents (β = 12.76, β = 18.60,
respectively). These findings indicate that the international migration of either the mother or
both parents positively influences children's Science and Mathematics outcomes. This may
suggest targeted investments in child education made in response to parental absence due to
migration.
Turning to the English proficiency of boys (Model 2), the results indicate fewer significant
predictors. This implies that English academic outcomes of boys whose parents migrated
internally or internationally do not differ notably from the grades of boys living with both
parents.
Additionally, caregiver education level appears to have a marginal yet significant effect on
Mathematics scores. Specifically, boys whose caregivers have at least a secondary education
show an improvement in Mathematics scores (β = 4.84) compared to boys whose caregivers
have a lower level of education.
Moreover, the study includes interaction effects between divorce status and parental migration
that may affect the school performance of boys. Specifically, the interaction terms revealed that
boys were less likely to report better scores in Science and Mathematics when their mothers
had migrated internationally and were divorced (β of the interaction term = -46.21, Model 1; β
of the interaction term = -28.27, Model 3, respectively). The higher coefficient for the
interaction term between having a mother abroad and being divorced, in relation to Science
scores, may indicate greater difficulties for boys in this particular setting. Furthermore, boys
were less likely to report higher scores in Mathematics when their parents were divorced and
either the mother or both parents had migrated internally (β of the interaction term = -17.91,
Model 3; β of the interaction term = -14.45, Model 3, respectively). Notably, boys were more
likely to report higher scores in English and Mathematics when their parents were divorced and
both had migrated internationally (β of the interaction term = 11.71, Model 2; β of the
interaction term = 8.43, Model 3, respectively).
migration status on the educational outcomes of girls. After controlling for independent
indicators, the study found no statistically significant differences in the Science and English
grades of girls whose parents have migrated, when compared to their peers from non-migrant
families. The only significant finding is the negative and statistically meaningful effect on the
Mathematics scores of girls whose both parents have migrated internationally (β = -12.71,

indicate that girls are less likely to report higher grades in Science and English when their
parents are divorced and residing abroad (β of the interaction term = -28.94, Model 4; β of the
interaction term = -26.74, Model 5, respectively). Furthermore, girls are less likely to report
elevated grades in English when their fathers have migrated internationally and are divorced (β
of the interaction term = -11.20, Model 5). The larger coefficients for the interaction terms,
specifically when both parents are abroad and divorced, suggest that girls may face heightened
difficulties in these particular transnational family settings.
Child age, duration of separation, living conditions, and the number of children in the household
did not show any significant effects on child education across the models.
Taken together, these findings illuminate the intricate ways in which parental migration status
interacts with other variables to affect educational outcomes of girls and boys in Ghana. While
migration status alone may not always impact the school performance of children, its interaction
with divorce status yields more substantive effects that warrant further investigation. This
research contributes to the growing body of literature that seeks to understand the social and
economic drivers affecting children's educational outcomes in the context of parental migration.
DISCUSSION
This study is among the first to employ panel data to explore the impact of parental migration
on children's educational outcomes within an African context. The longitudinal evidence
enables us to more precisely determine the effects that have previously been examined in studies
relying on qualitative or cross-sectional data. Three key findings emerge from the analysis, as
they contribute novel perspectives to the existing literature. First, parental migration, in and of
itself, does not inherently lead to diminished school performance among children, challenging
some of the prevailing views in scholarly work. Second, the influence of parental migration on
children's education is gender-specific; boys and girls experience disparate educational
outcomes when separated from their parents due to either internal or international migration.
Third, marital separation, when occurring in the context of parental migration, emerges as a
notable risk determinant, heightening the chances of negative educational outcomes for children
of migrant parents. A discussion of these findings is presented in the following.
This research includes measurements of both internal and international migration, specifying
which parent has migrated, to offer a more nuanced understanding of how parent-child
separation due to migration impacts the education of girls and boys in Ghana. The study reveals
that for boys, the international migration of either the mother or both parents is positively
associated with higher performance in Science and Mathematics, compared to those living with
both parents. However, this pattern was not observed for girls; with one exception, the data
showed statistically neutral effects, suggesting that parental migration does not necessarily
influence girls' educational outcomes. This finding challenges previous research that
highlighted the detrimental impact of parental absence, especially that of mothers, on child
well-being (Cortes, 2015; Parrenas, 2005; Wen & Lin, 2012). In contrast, our results align with
more recent empirical studies that underscore the resilience of children against negative
educational outcomes when parents migrate, either internally or internationally (Caarls et al.,
2021; Cebotari, 2020; Manyeruke et al., 2021). Recent research has found a link between
improved well-being outcomes among children and advancements in communication
technologies in the past decades that have facilitated long-distance parent-child interactions
(Marchetti-Mercer & Swartz, 2020; Wilding et al., 2020). This suggests that modern
communication tools may play an increased role in enabling migrant parents to remain actively
involved in their children's educational decisions and support.
This study incorporates a gender perspective to analyze school performance among children of
migrants in Ghana. It operates under the premise that child education in Ghana might exhibit
gender-specific patterns (Cebotari et al., 2018; Karpati et al., 2021). The findings indicate a
more pronounced benefit in education for boys, compared to girls, when experiencing parental
separation due to migration. Notably, boys demonstrate improved performance in Science and
Mathematics when their mothers or both parents engage in international migration. This effect
is especially significant in the case of both parents migrating, as evidenced by positive
correlations with English and Mathematics scores, even when accounting for factors like
parental divorce through interaction effects. Contrastingly, for girls in comparable
transnational circumstances, the results are either statistically neutral or indicate poorer
performance in Mathematics when both parents migrate internationally. These gender-specific
outcomes may be indicative of prevailing gender norms, previously observed to affect equitable
investment in children’s education in different contexts (Behrman & Knowles, 1999; Landale
& Oropesa, 2001). Additionally, the observed gender disparities could be reflective of an
uneven distribution of workload and resources within Ghanaian households, where girls are
more likely to engage in household chores and benefit less from remittances compared to boys
(Karpati et al., 2021; Whitehead et al., 2007). While the underlying causes warrant further
investigation, it is crucial to recognize that in certain migration scenarios, girls’ education in
Ghana may not benefit as much as boys from parental migration.
Finally, this study underscores that divorce is a barrier impacting the education of children who
stay behind due to migration. It was observed that boys whose mothers were absent, either
internally or internationally, as well as cases where both parents were away internally, exhibited
a decline in their academic performance, particularly in Mathematics, in the context of parental
divorce or separation. Similarly, for girls in families where the father or both parents had
migrated internationally, divorce or separation corresponded with lower grades in Science and
English. These findings align with existing research on the intersection of divorce, migration,
and child education in Ghana (Cebotari, 2020; Cebotari & Mazzucato, 2016) and in other
contexts (Caarls et al., 2021; Nobles, 2011). The evidence from this study leads to a crucial
observation: separations involving both internal and international parental migration and
marital discord tend to have a more adverse effect on children's educational outcomes. This
outcome can likely be attributed to the unique challenges posed by this specific form of parental
absence. In scenarios where divorced parents migrate, their ability to invest in their children's
education might be hindered, particularly if they remarry and have additional children in the
new union (Dreby, 2010). Future research should delve deeper into how parental migration and
marital strife intertwine and their subsequent effects on child education, enriching this line of
inquiry.
This study is not without limitations. Firstly, its sample is not nationally representative, being
drawn exclusively from two urban areas with high rates of out-migration in Ghana.
Consequently, the findings are not generalizable to all children in the country or to any
particular region as a whole. Another inherent limitation is migrant selectivity, a common
challenge in studies utilizing quantitative data. Currently, there are no comprehensive empirical
methods to fully account for migrant selectivity over time, especially for data involving
children. Moreover, the data used in this study span three rounds of observations, capturing
only the short- to medium-term effects of migration on child education. Additionally, the data
focus on children who are enrolled in school, limiting the generalizability of the results to the
broader population of school-age children in Ghana.
Despite these constraints, the study offers a unique longitudinal insight into the effects of
internal and international parental migration on child education within an African context. It
does so by incorporating a gender perspective and utilizing child-reported data to assess the
associations of interest. This approach marks a novel contribution, as existing research on
children in migrant families largely relies on holistic evaluations of child populations and on
adult assessments of children’s outcomes. By centering the voices of girls and boys, this study
posits that Ghanaian parental migration does not inherently equate to a vulnerability in
children's educational outcomes.
