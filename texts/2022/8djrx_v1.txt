LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 2
Abstract
Objective: Few environments reliably influence mean-level and rank-order changes in
personality – perhaps because personality development needs to be examined through an
individualized, person-centered lens.
Methods: The current study used Bayesian multilevel linear models to examine the association
between 16 life events and changes in person-centered, Big Five personality consistency across
four to 10 waves of data using four datasets (N = 24,491).
Results: Selection effects were found for events such as marriage, (un)employment, retirement,
and volunteering whereas between-person effects for slopes were found for events such as
beginning formal education, employment, and retirement. Within-person changes were often
small and emerged inconsistently across datasets but, when present, were brief and negative in
direction, suggesting life events can serve as a short-term disruption to the personality system.
However, there were many individual differences around event-related trajectories.
Conclusion: Our results highlight that the effects of life events depend on how personality and its
changes are quantified – with these findings underscoring the utility of a person-centered
approach as it can capture the full range of these idiosyncrasies. Overall, these findings suggest
that life events are associated with a range of idiosyncratic effects and can serve as a short-term,
destabilizing shock to one’s personality system.

The associations between life events and person-centered personality consistency
Life events are thought to influence personality development (Roberts & Jackson, 2008;
Specht et al., 2014). While the influence of life events has been thoroughly examined with
respect to variable-centered approaches, such as mean-level change (e.g., Denissen et al., 2019)
and rank-order stability of single traits (e.g., Specht et al., 2011), fewer studies have investigated
how these environmental factors are related to person-centered personality change (c.f. Jackson
& Beck, 2021). The commonly used variable-centered approach has limitations, as it typically
does not permit a holistic view of event-associated changes, and often assumes that people
change similarly in the response to a life event, thus masking any unique responses to life events.
Person-centered approaches, in contrast, do not require comparison to other people as
variable-centered approaches often do. Person-centered approaches to personality development,
such as through the use of individual profile (ipsative) correlations, compare the relative rankings
of attributes within an individual over time, so change is defined only with respect to their
previous scores. Despite the benefits offered by this approach, few studies have looked at
environmental influences on profile consistency. Recently, Wright and Jackson (2022a)
examined repeated measures of profile correlations to investigate trajectories of person-centered,
Big Five personality consistency. They identified considerable individual differences in person-
centered trajectories. Likely sources driving these idiosyncratic patterns of ipsative consistency
are environmental factors, both broad (e.g., culture, geographical location) and narrow (e.g.,
individually experienced life events) in variety.
The current study examines the association of environmental factors and person-centered
trajectories of Big Five profile change. In doing so, we use item-level profile correlations across
four to 10 waves of Big Five personality data with four datasets (N = 24,491). Changes in
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 4
consistency will be examined as a function of life events (e.g., getting married, getting divorced,
having a child) and broad country-level effects. We will examine both within-person (i.e.,
comparing a person’s own trajectory prior to and after their reported life event) as well as
between-person effects (i.e., selection effects and comparing consistency for those who
experience an event versus those who do not).
Environmental Impacts on Personality Development
Theoretical perspectives on personality development typically propose that biological
factors, environmental factors, or a combination of both are the proponents for driving
personality change (Specht et al., 2014). Theories vary with regard to the amount of indirect
versus direct influence environments have, but all acknowledge the role that an individual’s
environment has on shaping personality. Among possible factors, life events are a common
candidate for examining environmental impacts on personality development. Life events can be
defined as “time-discrete transitions that mark the beginning or the end of a specific status”
(Luhmann et al., 2012). Life events are valuable environmental factors to study as they can occur
both through selection on behalf of the individual (e.g., applying and getting a new job) or
unexpectedly (e.g., suddenly experiencing widowhood) and can serve as a stabilizing force (such
as through a decades-long marriage) or a destabilizing force (such as job loss).
Past work has examined the impact of life events on some aspects of personality
development (Bleidorn et al., 2018), primarily using variable centered approaches with the Big
Five traits. For example, Specht et al. (2011) examined the effects of a variety of life events on
personality mean levels and rank-order stability. Life events were associated with decreased
rank-order stability (Specht et al., 2011), suggesting that their experience may be driving
individual differences. In addition, Denissen et al. (2019) examined the effect of different life
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 5
events on personality trait change across multiple waves. This study did find some average
effects of life events impacting Big Five personality trait development, as well as individual
differences around event-related trajectories.
In addition to identifying trait-level effects, key components of the effects of life events
are their timing and duration. In line with work in the well-being literature, it is possible that
following an event, any changes an individual experienced would “bounce back” and their levels
would return to their set-point after enough time passes (Lykken & Tellegen, 1996). Some life
event research has indeed found that, depending on the event, some bouncing back does appear
to occur (Denissen et al., 2019; Schwaba & Bleidorn, 2019). This possibility highlights that it is
necessary to evaluate if any observed changes endure over longer periods of time. Furthermore,
separating anticipatory changes from changes following the onset of an event is needed (van
Scheppingen et al., 2016). For example, when examining between-group differences in
personality for individuals who began using substances, the most pronounced group differences
for users versus non-users appeared to be attributable to anticipatory changes at the within-
person level, suggesting it is not always the event itself (i.e., initiating substance use) directly
leading to these changes (Wright & Jackson, 2022b).
While the effects of life events on personality development have been frequently
examined, few replicable associations are found. Associations between personality traits and life
events vary in detection, magnitude, and duration depending on the timeframes they are
examined within (Denissen et al., 2019; van Scheppingen et al., 2016) and the direction of
changes can contradict prominent predictions based on theories of personality development (i.e.,
Social Investment Theory; van Scheppingen et al., 2016). It could be that life events are
complicated to study and have many nuanced effects; alternatively, it could also be the case that
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 6
this variable-centered approach has its limitations. That is, the focus on a single trait at a time
may not permit one to obtain a holistic view of personality development at the individual level.
Person-Centered Personality Consistency
Although general trends of stability in personality emerge between- and within-people,
personality traits are also malleable qualities that can vary over time (Bleidorn et al., 2013;
Roberts & Mroczek, 2008). Of the multiple ways to conceptualize personality change (e.g.,
mean-level change, rank-order stability; Roberts et al., 2008), ipsative or profile consistency is
among the least examined. This type of change occurs at the individual level and represents the
relative consistency of the configuration of traits within a single person across time (Asendorpf,
1992; De Fruyt et al., 2006; Donnellan et al., 2007; Klimstra et al., 2009; Ozer & Gjerde, 1989).
Ipsative consistency takes into account multiple aspects of someone’s personality – as opposed
to examining a single trait at a time – and thus is referred to as a person-centered approach as
opposed to variable-centered.
Wright and Jackson (2022a) find that people tend to maintain their person-typical levels
of person-centered consistency across multiple assessments across multiple years, such that
regardless of if someone has a profile correlation value of .30 or .80, they are stable in this level
of consistency across time. Despite these mostly stable levels of consistency, though, some
people changed in their consistency – similar to individual differences in mean-level personality
change. That is, while profile consistency is mostly stable, some people increase while others
decrease in their consistency. These individual differences could occur because of dispositional
qualities whereby some people are more or less mutable, in general. Alternatively, it could be
outside forces that result in changes to one’s environment that are associated with changes in
ipsative consistency. The finding of individual differences in changes in profile consistency
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 7
opens up the possibility that outside forces shape one’s personality consistency.
Effects of Life Events on Person-Centered Personality Development
If the lack of replicable mean-level changes associated with life events is due to life
events having unique effects for each person, such that life events are impactful, but impactful in
different ways, then life events will not be associated with mean-level changes. Moreover,
environmental factors such as life events are often found to have widespread effects in more than
one domain of life, requiring an individual to adapt to (possibly multiple) new behaviors,
routines, or self-perceptions (i.e., through new social roles/titles). Due to these concerns, person-
centered approaches allow a potentially better lens by which one can examine the effects of life
events on personality development, as it tests whether someone’s entire personality system is
affected, highlighting people rather than specific variables.
Compared to the preponderance of research on variable-centered approaches to
examining the effects of life events, relatively little has been done from the perspective of
person-centered approaches. When examining the influence of life events on ipsative change,
Jackson and Beck (2021) found primarily null or small effects for all life events except for
mental health events using two waves of data and comparing groups that did and did not
experience a life event. Additionally, a study examining idiographic structural change found that
although some people showed multivariate change, these individualized points of change had
little concordance with their reported life events (Beck & Jackson, 2021).
However, it is worth noting that the past work on ipsative change was limited to two
waves. This makes it difficult to ascertain whether life events were associated with changes in
one’s profile consistency to the point if it was or was not distinguishable from their typical
patterns of change across time. Additionally, the past person-centered work was all conducted
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 8
exclusively with one sample per study, rendering the generalizability of its findings to different
contexts, groups of people, or even countries difficult.
Current Study
In contrast to standard mean-level and rank-order perspectives of personality change and
development, ipsative consistency allows for a holistic examination of each individual’s
personality configuration across time. As such, it may offer new insights into how (de)stabilizing
the experience of life events may be in the scope of one’s Big Five personality system.
We investigate the within- and between-person effects of 16 life events on personality
development through the lens of individual test-retest, item-level profile correlations for the Big
Five traits. We do this across four to 10 waves of personality data in four longitudinal panel
studies, each of which are from a different region of the world. This not only gives some insight
into the replicability of these trends, but also an indication of possible broader environmental or
cultural influences that might account for between-study discrepancies.
We aim to answer three primary questions. First, are life events associated with between-
person differences in person-centered, Big Five consistency? Second, are life events associated
with changes to within-person consistency trajectories? Third, are results consistent across
datasets, suggesting the associations of life events and personality consistency are generalizable?

conducted by the German Institute of Economic Research (DIW Berlin) collecting data on
individuals in more than 11,000 German households. Data are freely available by application at
release in 2021. Data from the years 2005-2019 were used in the current study. Through years
2005-2017, the Big Five were assessed every four years, with the latest assessment occurring in
2019. Questions regarding life events were administered annually.

LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 11
For GSOEP, all items were scored on a 1 to 7 Likert scale (1 = “does not apply” to 7 = “applies
fully”). For HILDA, all items were scored on a 1 to 7 Likert scale (1 = “does not describe me at
all” to 7 = “describes me very well”). For HRS, all items asked how well an adjective applied to
the participants and were scored on a 1 to 4 Likert scale (1 = “a lot” to 4 = “not at all”). For
LISS, all items asked participants to rate how well the description applied to themselves and
were scored on a 1 to 5 Likert scale (1 = “very inaccurate” to 5 = “very accurate”).
Life Events
We examined the effect of 16 life events1. Not all specific life events were available in
each dataset, but there was generally a high level of agreement of events across datasets (see
reported experiencing the life event at any point during their available waves of data for this
study, then they were coded 1 for this variable and 0 if not. Additionally, the timing of a life
event was split into three regions: pre-event, onset of event, and post-event. If a person was
someone who reported having the life event but had not yet experienced it, they would be in the
“pre-event” stage. To be in the “onset of event” stage, the event must have occurred between the
two waves used to calculate a profile correlation. Typically, there were more waves of life event
data than there were waves of personality data. For example, personality traits could be assessed
every four years in a dataset whereas life events are assessed annually. Thus, for someone to be
coded as experiencing a life event for a particular wave of a profile correlation (i.e., the onset of
the event), the experience of the life event must have occurred between the two waves used to
calculate the profile correlation. Lastly, all waves of profile correlations following the onset of

either did not occur in at least half the datasets or were somewhat redundant with other life events in order to reduce
complexity and length. Results from those additional five life events can be found on the study’s OSF page.

Covariates
We examined the effect of two covariates: gender and age. For all datasets, gender was a
dummy variable coded such that 0 = male and 1 = female. For each dataset, the average of a
participant’s ages across their waves of data was centered around the average age within each
dataset. Thus, the age variable represented how far a participant’s average age deviated from
their own sample’s average age.
Analytic Plan
The analytic plan consisted of first calculating intraindividual profile correlations and
then conducting Bayesian multilevel analyses to examine between- and within-person trends in
these values as a function of the experience of the life events. Using a Bayesian approach
allowed for optimal flexibility, particularly allowing for the estimation of random effects around
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 13
each of the slopes surrounding the occurrence of life events. Bayesian multilevel models
(MLMs) can be interpreted similarly to standard MLMs using maximum likelihood estimation,
with the primary difference being Bayesian models use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
based estimator. All analyses were conducted with R statistical software (R core team, 2021).
Intraindividual Profile Correlations
First, individual test-retest profile correlations for all Big Five trait items were calculated
within each study. The multicon package (Sherman & Serfass, 2015) in R statistical software
was used for calculating profile correlations. Overall profile correlations were computed; these
are “overall” in the sense that the grand-mean for each item is not subtracted out from each
person’s scores prior to calculating the profile correlations. The formula for calculating this
profile correlation (𝑄 ) is,
∑(𝑥 − 𝑥̅̅̅̅)(𝑥 − 𝑥̅̅̅̅)
𝑖𝑗1 𝑗1 𝑖𝑗2 𝑗2
𝑄 =
𝑖𝑗
√ ∑(𝑥 − 𝑥̅̅̅̅)2 ∑(𝑥 − 𝑥̅̅̅̅)2
𝑖𝑗1 𝑗1 𝑖𝑗2 𝑗2
where 𝑥 represents an individual’s score for a personality item at one wave; 𝑥̅̅̅̅ represents the
𝑖𝑗1 𝑗1
average of their scores at that wave; 𝑥 represents an individual’s score for a personality item at
𝑖𝑗2
a second measurement wave; and 𝑥̅̅̅̅ represents the average of their scores at that second
𝑗2
measurement wave.
Interindividual Differences in Profile Correlations
Next, we used a Bayesian multilevel modeling framework to examine the interindividual
trends in profile correlations within each dataset. All analyses were conducted using the brms
package (Bürkner, 2017) in R. All models were fit as linear multilevel models with
measurements nested within individuals. Age and gender were included as Level 2 variables.
The generic form of our model specification can be seen with the following:
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 14
Level 1:
𝑄 = 𝑏 + 𝑏 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒_𝑐 + 𝑏 𝑝𝑟𝑒 ∗ 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒_𝑐 + 𝑏 𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑡 ∗ 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒_𝑐 + 𝑏 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 ∗ 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒_𝑐 + 𝑒
𝑖𝑗 0 1 𝑖𝑗 2 𝑖𝑗 𝑖𝑗 3 𝑖𝑗 𝑖𝑗 4 𝑖𝑗 𝑖𝑗 𝑖𝑗
Level 2:
𝑏 = 𝛾 + 𝛾 𝐿𝐸 + 𝛾 𝑎𝑔𝑒_𝑐 + 𝛾 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟 + 𝑈
0 00 01 𝑗 02 𝑗 01 𝑗 0𝑗
𝑏 = 𝛾 + 𝑈
1−4 10−40 1−4𝑗
The outcome variable 𝑄 was the test-retest profile correlation for each individual across
𝑖𝑗
waves. The 𝐿𝐸 variable represented the between-group difference in consistency for individuals
who experienced an event versus those who did not. People who experienced an event were
coded as 1 for this variable and 0 if they did not report having the life event. The scaling of the
𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒_𝑐 variable depended on if an individual experienced the life event in the model. For those
𝑖𝑗
individuals that did experience the event, it was coded such that 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒_𝑐 = 0 at the wave of
𝑖𝑗
For those individuals that did not experience the event, 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒_𝑐 was centered around the
𝑖𝑗
average wave that was immediately prior to the onset of event for individuals that did experience
the event. For example, if the average wave of profile correlation that individuals experienced an
event in a dataset was time = 2, then time would be centered around time = 1 for individuals who
did not experience the event in that dataset. Thus, the intercept represented the average profile
correlation for individuals who did not experience the event, at the time that was the average
wave immediately prior to the onset of the event for people who did experience it. This meant
that this exact time changed per life event per dataset. The 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒_𝑐 variable itself represented
𝑖𝑗
the slope for individuals who did not experience the life event.
Next, there were three dummy-coded variables (𝑝𝑟𝑒 , 𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑡 , 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 ) that captured the
𝑖𝑗 𝑖𝑗 𝑖𝑗
effect of experiencing the life event on the slope (i.e., 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒_𝑐 ). These variables were always
𝑖𝑗
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 15
coded 0 for individuals who did not experience a life event. The 𝑝𝑟𝑒 variable indicated if it was
𝑖𝑗
pre-event for an individual (coded 0 = onset of event or after, 1 = pre-event). The 𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑡
𝑖𝑗
variable indicated if an event had its onset between the two waves used to calculate an
individual’s profile correlation (coded 0 = pre- or post-event, 1 = event had its onset between the
waves). Lastly, the 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 variable indicated if an event had already passed its onset (coded 0 =
𝑖𝑗
pre-event or onset of event, 1 = beyond the onset of event). Since each of these parameters were
included as an interaction of the 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 variable, they represented the change in slope in each
𝑖𝑗
region, relative to the slope of individuals who did not experience the event. That is, the
interaction terms indicated if there were between-person differences in each of the three region’s
slopes, comparing those who experienced an event and those who did not. However, we were
primarily interested in the difference in slopes for those who did experience the event; thus, three
linear contrasts per model were conducted to compare the slopes in these three regions to
determine if they meaningfully differed amongst individuals who did experience the event.
Example Trajectories Across the Three Event-Related Regions
The prior for the intercept was a normal distribution centered around .60 with a standard
deviation of .10, as .60 is an approximate value of the initial ipsative test-retest correlations for
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 16
these datasets (Wright & Jackson, 2022a); the prior for the standard deviation parameters was a
Cauchy distribution centered around 0 with a spread of .10; the prior for the regression
coefficients was a normal distribution centered around 0 with a standard deviation of .10; the
prior for the Level 1 residual was an exponential distribution with a parameter value of 1; and the
prior for the correlation among the random effects was an LKJ distribution with a value of 1.
Results
Average Trends of Big Five Personality Consistency
First, we examined average linear trends of person-centered personality consistency
profile correlations in each dataset, ranged from .59 (GSOEP) to .70 (HRS). These values
indicate that, although there was a general finding of moderate to large consistency in personality
profiles, people, on average, did change in their personality between the first two waves. The
random effects for the intercepts ranged from .16 (HRS/LISS) to .18 (GSOEP/HILDA),
suggesting there was great variability in the degree to which people are consistent, even across
two waves. Next, the slopes ranged from -.00 (HRS) to .02 (GSOEP). Although these values are
small, the random effects around the slope values ranged from .02 (LISS) to .06
(GSOEP/HILDA/HRS) – which are double to more than six times the magnitude of the fixed
effect values. Overall, the average lack of a perfectly consistent personality profile combined
with the variability captured by the random effects suggests there are factors that can explain the
personality change occurring and the variability around this change (see Wright and Jackson
(2022a) for more information).

Next, we sought to examine if experiencing a life event was associated with changes in
person-centered consistency and variability around these changes. To do so, we present the
findings organized by the different parameters in the model. There were never effects of age on
personality consistency and the effect of gender was inconsistent across datasets (see Tables S3-
S9). Thus, we restrict the presentation of our findings to those involving the life events only.
Selection Effects: Experiencing an Event Versus Not
For the between-person effects of going onto experiencing a life event versus not
experiencing it (i.e., the differences in intercepts), results did not always emerge across all
health professional (-.04 to -.06), unemployment (-.03 to -.05), and being a recipient of
government financial assistance (i.e., welfare; -.04 to -.09) were all consistently associated with
lower values of person-centered personality consistency. In comparison, marriage (.03 to .06),
employment (.03 to .05), and volunteering (.03 to .06) were always associated with larger values
of personality consistency. Interestingly, when present, the effects of finishing education (.06)
were opposite of those for starting to attend some form of school (-.09).

Between-Person Effects: Slopes Across Pre-Event, Event Onset, and Post-Event
Next, we examined if an event was associated with differences in profile consistency
slopes for those who experienced an event relative to those who did not. In this section, we
describe effects that emerged across at least two datasets for an event (see Tables S3-S9 for full
results). Those who started attending some form of schooling in HILDA (.01) and LISS (.02)
increased in consistency compared to those who did not. For employment, those who reported
this event had larger post-event slopes in GSOEP (.01) and HILDA (.02). Many effects emerged
for retirement. First, across all datasets, those who retired declined in consistency at event onset
compared to those who did not retire (ranging from -.02 to -.04). Second, in all datasets except
GSOEP, these decreases in consistency continued such that retirees’ slopes were still smaller
than those who did not report retiring, even after the event occurred (ranging from -.01 to -.03).
Lastly, for those who reported receiving some form of government financial assistance, their
slopes were smaller than those who did not report this event in HILDA and HRS (both -.03).
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 19
Within-Person Effects: Pre-Event vs Event Onset
For the within-person effects capturing the differences in slopes of individuals who
experienced an event for their pre-event slope versus their slope at the onset of a life event,
present, the within-person effects of the onset of a life event were always negative (i.e., the
consistency slope at onset of event decreased relative to their pre-event consistency) – suggesting
a new life event, regardless of the specific event, often serves as a disruption to the system of an
example of this finding). Compared to the slope at event onset, the slopes for individuals prior to
experiencing a health event (.06), seeing a mental health professional (.05), and retiring (.01 to
.05) were meaningfully larger in at least half the datasets containing the event.

Within-Person Effects: Event Onset vs Post-Event
Next, we tested the within-person effects capturing the differences in slopes of
individuals who experienced an event for their slope at the onset of a life event versus their slope
always positive (i.e., the slope after the event increased relative to their slope at event onset).
This indicates that people appear to “bounce back” following the onset of a new life event,
suggesting that life events serve as a temporary disruption to an individual’s personality system.
Compared to the slope following an event, the slopes for individuals at onset of experiencing a
health event and retiring were meaningfully smaller (by .02 units) in at least half the datasets
containing the event. Notable exceptions to this “bouncing back” can be seen for finding a
romantic partner and getting married in the HILDA dataset. There were no average differences
between the onset of event slopes and the post-event slopes, suggesting the effect of
experiencing these events is longer-lasting than other events, perhaps because of more enduring
and continuous personality changes that occur as a result of maintaining these relationships.

Within-Person Effects: Pre-Event vs Post-Event
For the within-person effects capturing the change in the trajectory of an individual’s
personality consistency after an event compared to the trajectory prior to the event, there were
consistent. To the degree that these effects are present, it gives insight into if these life events are
associated with long-term changes in consistency. Alternatively, it might indicate that the
experience of the life event might reduce or exacerbate pre-existing selection effects.
For instance, for seeing a mental health professional in the HILDA dataset, the pre-event
slope was larger in magnitude than the post-event slope (by .04 units). Additionally, the selection
effect for being someone who experienced this event indicated that those individuals, on average,
had .04 units lower profile consistencies than those who did not go on to experience the event.
Thus, not only did individuals who reported seeing a mental health professional start with lower
average consistencies, but following the event, they continued to have slopes that were smaller in
magnitude than what they had pre-event. This would be an example of the event being associated
with further exacerbation of pre-existing between-person differences. In comparison, starting
schooling had the opposite pattern. Individuals who went on to experience this event started with
an average profile consistency that was often lower than individuals not reporting this event.
However, the post-event slopes increased relative to their pre-event slope.

Individual Differences in Event-Related Trajectories
Lastly, for the random effects of pre-event, onset of event, and post-event within-person
for an example graph). For variability around pre-event slopes, 40/53 random effects emerged,
nearly 76% of the possible effects. For variability around the onset of event slopes, 39/53
random effects emerged, or approximately 74% of the possible effects. Then, for the variability
around the post-event slopes, 27/53 random effects emerged, or almost 51% of possible effects.
Thus, even for those events which did not have an average within-person effect emerge, these
random effects indicate the associations life events have with personality vary greatly. That is,
the mostly average null findings for life events mask the variable effect life events have on
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 23
people. These random effects suggest individual differences reign supreme, further emphasizing
taking a person-centered approach to evaluating factors influencing personality development.

Discussion
We investigated between- and within-person effects of 16 life events on trajectories of
test-retest profile correlations using Big Five trait items. We found that life events were
associated with replicable between-person effects on personality profile consistency, with effects
varying in both magnitude and direction depending on the specific event. In comparison, within-
person effects, when found, tended to be specific and did not often replicate across samples.
However, when they were present, a particular pattern of effects emerged. The onset of a life
event was always associated with a decrease in profile consistency relative to one’s prior level of
personality consistency and in the waves following the life event (i.e., the post-event slope),
increases in consistency were observed. This pattern of results indicates that although life events
were not often associated with large nor widespread within-person effects, they can serve as a
short-term disruption to the system of one’s personality coherence.
Life Events Have Many Selection Effects, Fewer Socialization Effects
In line with past work, we found many selection effects for life events (Denissen et al.,
2019; Jackson et al., 2012; Lüdtke et al., 2011; Specht et al., 2011). Compared to individuals
who did not go on to experience the life event, people who reported beginning a romantic
partnership, getting married, having a child, finishing their education, becoming employed, and
volunteering all had higher initial values of consistency. In comparison, individuals who reported
a new health event/diagnosis, seeing a psychologist/psychiatrist, smoking cigarettes, separating
from a significant other, beginning to attend some form of school, unemployment, retirement,
and receiving government financial assistance had lower initial values of consistency compared
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 25
to individuals that did not report later experiencing these events. This pattern of selection effects
is consistent with previous personality development research. For instance, past work has found
that individuals with higher levels of traits such as conscientiousness and agreeableness and
lower levels of neuroticism are typically more likely to be employed, get married, and finish
college, whereas the opposite is true of events such as divorce, unemployment, and mental health
events (Beck & Jackson, 2022a; Soto, 2019; Wright & Jackson, 2022c). Higher levels of profile
consistency are associated with these “mature” personality traits (Donnellan et al., 2007; Wright
& Jackson, 2022a). Thus, it appears individuals who went on to experience events associated
with mature social roles likely had personality profiles matching the “mature” profile – and thus
higher levels of profile consistency.
Regarding socialization effects, it is somewhat difficult to compare our findings with
most of the previous work on life events and personality development because past research
often focused on the impact of life events on changes in single traits and these changes were
quantified via mean levels rather than levels of consistency (Bleidorn et al., 2018; Denissen et
al., 2019). However, our findings suggest two main conclusions. First, life events have relatively
small effects on personality development, but quantifiable effects across different types of
change. For instance, among our events, retirement was associated with lower levels of between-
person profile consistency at onset of and after the event, which is in line with previous research
finding that the transition to retirement is associated with changes in multiple personality traits
(Löckenhoff et al., 2009; Schwaba & Bleidorn, 2019; Specht et al., 2011). If retirement elicits
changes in personality that differ from someone’s typical pattern of personality development,
then their profile consistency understandably decreases relative to individuals not experiencing
this event. Furthermore, across the periods of retirement, within-person changes in consistency
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 26
were sometimes found such that people decreased in consistency during its onset and then began
to increase in consistency following retirement. This pattern of results is also in line with past
research finding both that a) some changes in personality traits following retirement continue to
persist in years following the event, thus leading to increases in consistency as these changes are
stable and b) the traits that change after retirement are consistent with increases in levels of
profile consistency (i.e., increases in agreeableness, decreases in neuroticism; Schwaba &
Bleidorn, 2019). As such, these findings complement and extend previous findings, showing
different types of change are influenced by the same life events.
Second, within-person effects are short-lasting and relatively small in magnitude. When
effects did emerge, the onset of a life event always had average effects of disrupting this
consistency, such that it subsequently decreased from its previous level. This suggests that,
regardless of the typical personality development for a person (i.e., their own person-specific
levels of and changes in these items across time), life events disrupted these characteristic
developmental patterns and were associated with atypical changes to their personality – thus
resulting in decreased consistency. This disruption is typically brief, such that “bouncing back”
occurs whereby an individual again approaches their pre-event level of consistency rather than
there being a scarring effect as the result of the life event. A similar phenomenon has been found
in studies examining mean-level changes in traits (Bollich-Ziegler et al., 2021; Denissen et al.,
2019; Schwaba & Bleidorn, 2019; Wright & Jackson, 2022b). This “bouncing back” could occur
for a few reasons, such as people returning to their normal set-points for certain personality
attributes (Diener et al., 2006; Headey & Wearing, 1989; Lucas et al., 2003), which is in line
with past work examining mean-level changes elicited by life events and their often-short-lived
nature. Alternatively, event-associated changes could become incorporated into one’s personality
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 27
structure and long-term effects are then less evident (Schwaba & Bleidorn, 2019). Note that this
bouncing back does not necessarily mean individuals return to their previous personality profile.
The slight increases in consistency that are observed post-event relative to onset of the event
simply indicate that the changes in each trait indicator are more similar again. That is, there is a
brief time where greater change occurs, then the change into the next period is similar to the
amount of change pre-event. Furthermore, this destabilizing shock to one’s personality system
can have both positive and negative effects. For instance, it could be adaptive to be flexible in
one’s personality and adjust one’s traits to better fit their current environment.
Event- and Study-Specific Associations
In addition to the broad pattern of many selection effects paired with few socialization
effects, there were certain trends that emerged for associations in our study based on qualities of
the life events and across datasets. For the between-person selection effects, in general, those that
eventually experienced “negative” or loss-based events had lower levels of consistency whereas
“positive” or gain-based events were associated with higher levels of consistency. It could be
undesirable for an individual to always have a shifting personality, which sets them up to
experience life events where some constancy in who you are is beneficial, either to others (e.g.,
interpersonal relationships) or yourself (e.g., periods of poor mental health). Unpredictable shifts
in behavior that contradict people’s expectations for how you think, feel, or behave could
perhaps be unsettling or reveal tendencies that are not appealing in the long run, thus making it
less likely to continue encountering positive events in the future.
Whereas thematically similar life events showed certain patterns of effects across
datasets, some specific life events also had replicable patterns within our study. Notably, these
study-wide patterns mostly occurred for selection effects, which again highlights the robustness
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 28
of these findings also shown in past work (Denissen et al., 2019; Jackson et al., 2012; Lüdtke et
al., 2011; Specht et al., 2011). For selection effects that were positive in direction, such that
individuals with higher levels of consistency were more likely to report experiencing this event,
marriage (3/4 datasets), employment (3/4 datasets), and volunteering (4/4 datasets) were the life
events with replicable effects. Similarly, for selection effects that were negative in direction,
seeing a mental health professional (2/2 datasets), receiving government financial assistance (3/3
datasets), and unemployment (4/4 datasets) were the life events with replicable effects. The life
events with positive selection effects are all associated with “mature” personality trait profiles,
whereas opposite associations occur for those that had negative selection effects (Beck &
Jackson, 2022a; Soto, 2019; Wright & Jackson, 2022c). Importantly, the replication across
datasets suggests the attracting traits associated with these events are consistent in different
environments. The maturity principle is a phenomenon that has been replicated across different
cultures (Bleidorn et al., 2013). While this is an average trend, there are still individual
differences (Schwaba & Bleidorn, 2018) – indicating not everyone shows this developmental
pattern. If the people that do show this pattern, or have already experienced these increases in
line with it, accordingly have higher levels of profile stability due to their elevated levels of these
traits (Wright & Jackson, 2022a), then it appears to be a robust indicator of being more likely to
go on to experience certain life events associated with these social roles. Indeed, events such as
marriage and employment are among the more prototypical “mature” roles discussed in the
personality development literature (Caspi et al., 2005), and the universality of these events (at
least in WEIRD countries) perhaps bolstered the robust findings within our study.
Then, although within-person effects emerged for select life events in some datasets, the
final noteworthy pattern is that these had poor replicability across each of the four studies. This
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 29
could occur for a few reasons. First, it could be that the effects of life events are dependent upon
the environment one is in, such that the typicality of the life event, the importance or emphasis
placed on it, or the age at which it is normally experienced in that environment could have
implications for its subsequent associations with personality development. For example, for
divorce, an effect was only found in the HRS dataset. Considering HRS had by far the greatest
average age in our study relative to other datasets, this suggests that experiencing divorce during
a non-normative period of life is particularly impactful and thus disruptions to one’s personality
consistency are observed to a greater degree than if the event occurred at a more normative time.
Second, it could be a measurement artifact, such that the items used to assess personality
in each study differed in their lability and/or the average level of consistency of people using one
measure affects the degree to which changes in it are more likely to occur. For instance, items
asking about one’s engagement in a behavior associated with a trait may be differentially subject
to change relative to items asking about how well an adjective associated with a trait applies to a
person. To the degree that the item types have an effect on how much profile consistency
changes, it could be related to how personality is changing in association with a life event (i.e.,
bottom-up or top-down). Overall, the most within-person effects were found for HILDA and
HRS datasets. The items used in these datasets were adjective lists, which is in comparison with
the behavior descriptions more often used in GSOEP and LISS (File S2).
Third, the lack of replicable within-person effects could be due to life events simply not
having large nor widespread effects on personality development (Jackson & Beck, 2021). When
examining past work examining mean-level changes, the culmination of this work suggests
similar conclusions as there are few replications across studies (e.g., Bleidorn et al., 2018;
Denissen et al., 2019; Specht et al., 2011; van Scheppingen et al., 2016). It is possible that all
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 30
three explanations for small and inconsistent within-person effects are at play, suggesting future
work should continue to incorporate methods and data that allow us to address under what
conditions life events may be associated with personality development.
Individual Differences in Associations
One reason for why life events may not have effects at the population level is that they
are specific to individuals, with some people being more or less impacted by life events. When
examining the individual differences around these average effects, it becomes clear that the
associations life events had did not emerge for all individuals similarly. Individuals who went on
to experience a life event differed the most in their pre-event slopes, which could speak to both
varying initial levels of consistency and differences in anticipatory changes associated with the
event. Anticipatory changes related to a life event have been documented in past research
(Denissen et al., 2019; Wright & Jackson, 2022b). To the extent that these vary in presence and
magnitude across individuals and life events, it could reflect the predictability of the life event
(e.g., sudden family death versus retirement), the extent that qualities of the individual strongly
attracted them to that event (i.e., such that these attracting traits are more likely to be the ones to
change in response to the event; Roberts & Wood, 2006), and the degree to which an event might
require preparation or adjustments in one’s daily life before its onset (e.g., a new child).
The slopes around the onset of the life events also evidenced large amounts of individual
variability. Reasons for variability in the effects of event onset can be dependent upon the
individual themselves, such as their expectations of the event, attitudes about the event, and pre-
existing personality characteristics (Lodi-Smith & Roberts, 2007; Lüdtke et al., 2011; Rakhsani
et al., 2021). Basically, an event could mean different things for different people. Importantly, if
an event does not bring forth new situations or necessary adaptations to one’s typical lifestyle,
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 31
then subsequent alterations in state or behavioral expressions of personality seem unlikely to
follow (Wrzus & Roberts, 2017). For example, starting new employment for the first time (i.e.,
just finished school) might affect someone differently compared to starting a new position within
the company they have been with for over a decade.
Additionally, the variability around the onset of an event could be dependent upon the
timing of the event in the individual’s life, such that it may occur at a non-normative time, which
has been suggested and found to lead to stronger effects compared to normative events
(Neugarten, 1976; Luhmann et al., 2012). Or, it could be an atypical event for the environment or
culture one is in, resulting in them lacking a guide for appropriate future behaviors in that
situation. This could instead strengthen their pre-existing characteristics rather than lead to
event-specific changes (Caspi & Moffitt, 1993; Beck & Jackson, 2022b). It may be the case that
these atypical events are the ones associated with personality change, emphasizing the
importance of examining the context and broader environment one is in when considering the
effects of various life events.
Lastly, individual differences around the post-event slopes had the relatively fewest
number of effects but still emerged for half of the possible total effects. Interestingly, the smaller
number of effects around post-event slopes might reflect the counterintuitive finding that life
events may make people more similar (Jackson & Beck, 2021), such that individuals show
similar patterns of personality development following a life event. This could occur for a few
reasons. First, life events could bring people within an optimal range for certain personality
characteristics, such that, for example, moderate levels of conscientiousness may be most
beneficial for some events (e.g., partnership, marriage). Being responsible and able to stick to
commitments is important in a relationship but being too rigid and inflexible may be detrimental
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 32
to the reality of maintaining that relationship. Thus, individuals who are low or high might be
changed in the according directions to reach an optimal level of this trait – thereby reducing
variability. Second, it could reflect that, on average, there are just fewer disturbances in one’s
personality system associated with the time following a life event. This could occur because any
changes associated with the onset of the event then become typical for individuals, such that the
changes were reinforced as the roles associated with the life event were maintained across time,
and people integrated these changes into their own characteristic personality development. Third,
the event-related changes could have dissipated in intensity across time, such that disturbances to
their personality system became less pronounced and thus there are now less prominent changes
occurring. In any case, it appears that, on average, the effects of life events after they occur are
more similar for individuals compared to the pre-event and onset of event effects.
Limitations & Future Directions
While our study had a number of advantages that made it well-suited to investigate the
impact of life events on trends of person-centered personality consistency, it was not without its
limitations. First, additional measures relevant to the life events such as expectations for and
attitudes about the events would likely help to explain some of the individual variability we
observed in within-person changes in consistency. Along similar lines, it could be helpful to
track the occurrence of these life events relative to if they occur during normative periods for
individuals in a certain country or if they instead occurred at non-normative times. It could be
that factors such as these largely account for which individuals are more so affected by life
events. Furthermore, it would be ideal to have more frequent-in-time measurements of the
occurrence of life events (e.g., monthly assessments) as well as measures of the life events that
overlapped to a greater degree with the personality assessments, so as to more precisely quantify
LIFE EVENTS AND PERSONALITY CONSISTENCY 33
changes in consistency that occur alongside life events. Future research with this type of data can
then examine questions such as the degree to which these effects vary over certain time intervals
or their duration. Second, each of our samples were from a country of European descent. Thus,
while we can somewhat speak to the degree the results generalize across individuals from
different environments, this generalization is limited to countries that share many similarities.
Third, not every event was available in each dataset. Those events not present in all datasets have
less evidence for their broad impact on personality consistency and thus their results should be
considered less conclusive. Lastly, we did not control for the possibility of a person reporting
multiple life events, which could complicate the interpretation of any event-specific effects.
Conclusion
In this study, we examined the association of 16 life events with trajectories of person-
centered personality consistency in four large-scale datasets, each from a different region of the
world. The most effects were by far found for between-person differences in which individuals
go on to experience a life event, whereas within-person changes associated with life events less
frequently emerged. When within-person effects did emerge, they indicated that life events
always served as a disruption to an individual’s personality system. Furthermore, these changes
in consistency were often brief, such that people typically “bounced back” to higher levels of
consistency in the waves following the event. Our results add to the body of literature suggesting
that, on average, life events are not associated with numerous nor large within-person personality
changes, regardless of how this within-person change is quantified. However, the many
individual differences around these event-related effects suggests there are various mechanisms
at play that idiosyncratically link changes in personality development to some individuals and
life events, calling for further research that focuses holistically on the individual.
