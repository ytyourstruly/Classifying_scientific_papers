Which Emotions Can be “True?”
People sometimes refer to certain emotions as “true.” For instance, people talk of “true
happiness” and “true love.” Although it’s puzzling what “true” means in such cases, perhaps
even more puzzling is the fact that not all emotions are described that way. For instance,
intuitively, it seems unnatural to say “true grumpiness” or “true lust.” Past research in this area
has focused on positive emotions such as happiness and love (Earp et al., 2021; Phillips et al.,
2011, 2017; Prinzing & Fredrickson, 2022). This might be taken to imply that only good emotions
are seen as capable of being true. However, it might also be that people think it makes perfect
sense to say “true sadness” or “true hatred.” It may be revealing to learn which emotions people
think can be “true.” In the present study, we asked people about the degree to which it makes
sense to call various emotions “true” and the degree to which those emotions are good or bad,
the sort of emotion that makes a person’s life go better or worse.
Method
Participants
We recruited 402 participants on Prolific. We included an attention check in the
survey—a question that read: “For this question please simply place the slider at 65.”
Participants (n = 7) who did not mark 65 were excluded from analysis, yielding an analysis
sample of N = 395 (M = 40.28, SD = 16.14; 43.3% men, 56.2% women, < 1% other gender
age age
or declined to state; 6.3% Asian or Asian American, 25.3% Black or African American; 4.1%
Hispanic or Latinx, 55.4% White or European American, 4.6% other race, 4.1% mixed race, <
1% declined to state).
Procedure and Measures
Participants were randomly assigned to answer one of four questions about twenty
emotions randomly selected from a pool of 40 emotions. We used two questions to assess
trueness and two to assess goodness. All response scales were 100-point sliders. The
instructions and question text are given below (blanks were filled in with emotion terms):
● Trueness Question 1: “Please indicate the extent to which each of the following
statements sound weird or natural. Could you imagine saying or hearing someone say
each of these statements in a normal conversation? That person is experiencing true
___.” (0 = “Sounds weird”, 100 = “Sounds natural”)
● Trueness Question 2: “Please indicate the extent to which each of the following
statements makes sense. If someone said each of these statements in a real-life
conversation, would the statements even make sense? Imagine someone says: "I
suppose there is a sense in which that person is feeling ___. But it isn't true ___." Does
this statement even make sense?” (0 = “Makes no sense at all”, 100 = “Makes perfect
sense”)
● Goodness Question 1: “All else being equal, to the extent that a person feels ___, this
will make their life go…” (0 = “Much worse”, 100 = “Much better”)
● Goodness Question 2: “When thinking about ___, would you say that feeling this
emotion is generally a negative or positive thing?” (0 = “Extremely negative”, 1 =
“Extremely positive”)
All analyses were performed at the item-level. That is, we computed means for each emotion on
each question and used these means in all our analyses.
Results
The means, standard deviations, and correlations between the four questions are shown
questions were also strongly correlated, though not quite as strongly. Interestingly, neither of the
goodness items was significantly correlated with either of the trueness items. We computed a
single goodness and trueness score for each emotion by averaging the two corresponding
Variable M SD 1 2 3
1. Goodness 1 49.50 23.59
2. Goodness 2 46.49 28.39 .99*
[.98, .99]
3. Trueness 1 60.38 11.49 .25 .20
[-.07, .53] [-.13, .49]
4. Trueness 2 45.20 6.75 .32 .29 .61*
[-.00, .58] [-.04, .56] [.35, .77]

To test whether goodness and trueness might be associated, we regressed trueness on
goodness. There was no significant association, b = .09, 95% CI: [-.01, .19], p = .089. However,
adding a quadratic term to the model, we found that the linear term was significant, b = –.96,
95% CI: [–1.66, –.26], p = .009, as as was the quadratic term, b = .01, 95% CI: [.003, .016], p =
.004.
Discussion
These results indicate a substantial degree of variance in whether people think that, for a
given emotion, it makes sense to call that emotion “true.” Unsurprisingly, most people think that
it makes perfect sense to call emotions like love and happiness “true.” However, most people
also seem to think that it doesn’t make any sense to call emotions like grumpiness or lust “true.”
Although the two emotions with the highest average ratings were positive (love and happiness),
the next highest emotion was sadness, followed closely by fear. Hence it is not the case that
only positive emotions are seen as capable of being true. Moreover, there are also emotions
that people see as very positive—like calmness, awe, and amusement—that they don’t think
can be true. In other words, there does not seem to be a simple, linear relationship between
trueness and goodness. Rather, there is a curvilinear relationship, whereby the emotions that
are most seen as capable of being true are the emotions that are seen as most good or most
bad. Future studies may be able to identify factors that shape this property of emotions.
