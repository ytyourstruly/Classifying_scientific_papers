EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
Abstract
Schizotypy, a personality structure that resembles schizophrenia symptoms, is often
associated with abnormal facial emotion perception. Based on the prevailing sense of threat
in psychotic experiences, and the immediate perceptual history of seeing others’ facial
expressions, individuals with high schizotypal traits may exhibit a heightened tendency to
anticipate anger. To test this, we used insights from Representational Momentum (RM), a
perceptual phenomenon in which the endpoint of a dynamic event is systematically displaced
forward, into the immediate future. Angry-to-ambiguous and happy-to-ambiguous avatar
faces were presented, each followed by a probe with the same (ambiguous) expression as the
endpoint, or one slightly changed to express greater happiness/anger. Participants judged if
the probe was “equal” to the endpoint and rated how confident they were. The sample was
divided into high (N=46) and low (N=49) schizotypal traits using the Schizotypal Personality
Questionnaire (SPQ). Firstly, a forward bias was found in happy-to-ambiguous faces,
suggesting emotional anticipation solely for dynamic faces changing towards a potential
threat (anger). This may reflect an adaptative mechanism, as it is safer to anticipate any
hostility from a conspecific than the opposite. Secondly, contrary to our hypothesis, high
schizotypal traits did not heighten RM for happy-to-ambiguous faces, nor did they lead to
overconfidence in biased judgements. This may suggest a typical pattern of emotional
anticipation in nonclinical schizotypy, but caution is needed due to the use of self-report
questionnaires, university students, and a modest sample size. Future studies should also
investigate if the same holds for clinical manifestations of schizophrenia.

EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
1. Introduction
1.1.Schizophrenia and Emotion Perception
Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder, marked by a complex pattern of
disorganized (e.g., speech), positive (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), and negative symptoms
(e.g., avolition, anhedonia) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Additionally,
schizophrenia is characterized by deficits in social cognition (Green et al., 2015). These are
correlated with poor functioning outcomes (Halverson et al., 2019), present at early stages of
the disorder (Healey et al., 2016), and resistant to antipsychotics (e.g., Kucharska-Pietura &
Mortimer, 2013).
One of the most affected social cognitive abilities is emotion perception (Green et al.,
2015). Overall, individuals with schizophrenia show large and consistent deficits in the
recognition and discrimination of emotional faces (see Kohler et al., 2010; Savla et al., 2013).
For instance, individuals with schizophrenia tend to misattribute anger or fear to neutral faces
(e.g., Habel et al., 2010; Kohler et al., 2003; Pinkham et al., 2011; Premkumar et al., 2008).
This aligns with a predominant sense of threat experienced in psychosis (Underwood et al.,
2016), especially in social contexts (e.g., Veling et al., 2016). Since being able to perceive
others’ emotional states is critical for a successful emotional communication, an aberrant
perception of emotional faces can negatively affect patients’ social behaviour, thus
contributing to a cascade of socio-emotional difficulties (e.g., Hooker & Park, 2002). Yet,
individuals with schizophrenia (compared to healthy controls) seem to be overconfident in
their ability to accurately identify others’ emotional (e.g., Köther et al., 2018; Perez et al.,
2020) and mental states (e.g., Köther et al., 2012). This overconfidence, which extends to
lower-level visual perception as well (e.g., Moritz et al., 2014), is believed to play a role in
the development and maintenance of positive symptoms, such as delusions (Balzan, 2016).
Furthermore, deficits in emotion perception might be a potential endophenotype of
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
schizophrenia, as they are also observed (although less severely) in unaffected first-degree
relatives (Allott et al., 2015), clinical high-risk (Allott et al., 2014) and, of foremost
importance to the present study, schizotypy (see Giakoumaki, 2016; Zouraraki et al., 2022).
1.2.Schizotypy and Emotion Perception
Schizotypy was first described as a manifestation of genetic risk of schizophrenia
(e.g., Meehl, 1989) and is currently defined as a personality structure characterized by
psychological factors that resemble the positive, negative, and disorganized symptoms of
schizophrenia (Ettinger et al., 2014; Nelson et al., 2013). Additionally, schizotypy and
schizophrenia seem to overlap on some genetic, cognitive, neurobiological, and psychosocial
levels, thus suggesting a psychotic continuum, ranging from low schizotypal traits in the
general population to the clinical manifestation of schizophrenia (occurring in some extreme
cases of schizotypy, and/or under adverse environmental factors) (Nelson et al., 2013).
Indeed, although the presence of schizotypal traits is not enough for a schizophrenia
diagnosis, individuals with high schizotypal traits have an increased risk of developing a
psychotic disorder (Debbané et al., 2015). Hence, the study of schizotypal traits in the general
population has gained increased attention, as it can provide critical knowledge about the
mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestation of schizophrenia while eliminating clinical
confounders, namely medication side-effects, comorbidities, chronical hospitalization, and
psychomotor slowing (Barrantes-Vidal et al., 2015; Ettinger et al., 2014).
Concerning emotion perception, there is evidence that higher schizotypal traits are
associated with abnormal facial emotion perception (e.g., Brown & Cohen, 2010; Dawes et
al., 2021; Fusar-Poli et al., 2022; Morrison et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2020). For instance, using
a visual search paradigm, Uono et al. (2021) found that schizotypal traits – evaluated with the
Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ; Raine, 1991) – were negatively correlated with
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
the effectiveness for detecting normal versus “anti-facial” expressions of happiness/anger
among a crowd of neutral faces. The authors proposed that individuals with high schizotypal
traits failed to detect emotional faces in a privileged manner because they overattribute
(emotional) salience to non-salient stimuli (Uono et al., 2021). This is consistent with a
positive correlation between schizotypal traits and the activation of the right posterior
superior temporal sulcus during neutral face perception (Yan et al., 2020). In this vein, it is
possible that the aberrant attribution of salience described in neurobiological models of
psychosis – presumably caused by elevated dopaminergic signalling (Howes & Nour, 2016;
Kapur, 2003) – represents a schizophrenia vulnerability that may manifest at a subclinical
level as well (e.g., van Os et al., 2017).
1.3.Dynamic Emotional Faces
Despite the constant dynamic changes of faces in the real world, which convey
dynamic cues of verbal and non-verbal communication, such as gaze, and emotional state
(Dobs et al., 2018; Krumhuber et al., 2013), the exploration of how individuals with
schizotypal traits perceive such stimuli remains largely unexplored (see Zouraraki et al.,
2022). Remarkably, studies have shown that observers can anticipate others’ emotional states
based on subtle changes in facial expression (Jellema et al., 2011; Marian & Shimamura,
2013; Palumbo & Jellema, 2013) and that this ability is altered in neurodevelopmental
disorders (Palumbo et al., 2015, 2018). For instance, a series of studies demonstrated that
neutral faces initially displaying a happy (happy-to-neutral) or angry (angry-to-neutral)
expression are rated as more angry or happy, respectively, which indicates a bias towards the
anticipated emotional state (e.g., Jellema et al., 2011; Palumbo et al., 2015, 2018; Palumbo &
Jellema, 2013). According to the authors, this phenomenon reflects mechanisms of emotional
1 Anti-facial expressions are facial expressions in which the facial feature displacement is similar in magnitude,
but opposite in direction, in relation to their corresponding normal facial expression (Uono et al., 2021).
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
anticipation triggered by the immediate perceptual history of others’ facial expression; but
they could also be explained by Representational Momentum (RM).
1.4.Representational Momentum
RM is a perceptual phenomenon where the final location of a moving target is
systematically shifted forward, extending into the immediate future and aligning with the
direction of motion (e.g., Freyd & Finke, 1984; see Hubbard, 2010, 2014). Despite the lack of
consensus on the mechanisms underlying RM, this phenomenon is believed to compensate
for delays in sensory and motor systems (Hogendoorn, 2020), and to be influenced by
characteristics of the observer, such as expertise and psychopathology (see Hubbard, 2014 for
a theoretical review). Yet, only few studies have looked at whether RM effects vary
depending on traits along the psychotic continuum (e.g., De Sá Teixeira et al., 2013; Jarrett et
al., 2002; Tulver et al., 2019; Vettise, 2012). For instance, Jarrett et al. (2002) observed a
non-significant trend towards a larger RM effect in individuals with schizophrenia and those
with high schizotypal traits (top 16% of scorers on the SPQ), compared to individuals with
low schizotypal traits (bottom 16% of scorers on the SPQ). This may stem from a failure to
inhibit the automatic process of motion extrapolation in schizophrenia and schizotypy.
Nevertheless, it is important to note that this effect was just shy of the statistical threshold,
likely influenced by an underpowered sample size. Using a nonclinical sample, Vettise
(2012) later found a positive correlation between RM for implied motion and the SPQ
disorganized factor, but not the cognitive-perceptual SPQ factor (which does not support the
author’s main hypothesis). In contrast, a multi-paradigm study conducted by Tulver et al.
(2019) revealed that individuals scoring higher on positive schizotypy (assessed with the
cognitive-perceptual SPQ-Brief factor) exhibited a reduced reliance on their prior knowledge
in visual perception. This was evidenced by, for instance, a smaller RM for smooth motion.
Given the differences across these studies in terms of response modality (e.g., probe
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
judgement versus spatial adjustment), motion (e.g., implied versus smooth), and sample
characterization (e.g., nonclinical versus clinical population), direct comparisons between
them present significant challenges. Additionally, the exclusive use of non-emotional stimuli
(e.g., jumping man) in these studies raises doubts about whether schizotypal traits influence
RM in response to changes in emotional stimuli.
The RM effect has been observed not only for basic stimuli, but also for socially
relevant events, including pain (Dozolme et al., 2018; Prigent et al., 2018), social threat
(Greenstein et al., 2016), gaze (Hudson et al., 2009; Hudson & Jellema, 2011), and emotional
faces (e.g., Courgeon et al., 2010; Senior et al., 2020; Uono et al., 2014; Yoshikawa & Sato,
2008, but see Thornton, 2014 for conflicting findings). For instance, Greenstein et al. (2016)
found that the final location of a ring moving towards a stationary dot was more strongly
displaced forward when both stimuli were preceded by a threatening vignette (e.g., the ring
was an assailant holding a weapon and approaching the victim, represented by the dot) than a
neutral vignette (e.g., the ring was a person holding a sandwich). This suggests that RM is
greater for threatening social events, which may reflect an adaptative anticipation
phenomenon (e.g., Gladwin & Vink, 2020). Yoshikawa and Sato (2008) conducted a study
where participants were shown neutral-to-emotional human faces, each followed by a static
probe. Participants were then asked to adjust the probe’s facial expression to match the final
frame of the animation. Probes were systematically adjusted to a more intense version,
regardless of the emotional category. A similar effect was reported by Courgeon et al. (2010),
but only for emotional faces ending at medium intensity (50%), with higher intensities (70%
and 90%) resulting in a backward bias – an effect opposite to RM. They also observed that
the magnitude of this effect depended on the emotion type, with anger, disgust, fear, and
surprise producing an “Emotional Momentum” (Courgeon et al., 2010).
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
To our knowledge, the RM effect for emotional faces has not yet been investigated in
schizophrenia. Regarding schizotypal traits, Uono et al. (2015) found that scores on the SPQ
were positively correlated with a tendency to exaggerate the intensity of the final frame of
neutral-to-happy and neutral-to-fearful faces (at 52%, 80%, or 108% intensity), regardless of
the emotional category (Uono et al., 2015). However, this effect extended to static faces was
well, thus pointing to a broader pattern of aberrant emotion perception in schizotypal traits,
rather than an exaggerated RM for socio-emotional events. Considering that RM is greater for
emotional faces ending at lower intensity (Courgeon et al., 2010), it is plausible that
presenting emotional faces changing towards neutral/ambiguous expressions amplifies a
possible difference between “high” and “low” schizotypy – especially since the perception of
neutral/ambiguous expressions is highly dependent on contextual cues (see Wieser & Brosch,
2012).
1.5.Current Study
In this preregistered study, we aimed to investigate the effects of schizotypal traits in
emotional anticipation for dynamic emotional faces, using the RM framework. For that, we
created a probe judgement task with ambiguous faces (depicting 50% of happiness and 50%
of anger) of male and female avatars that began with a fully angry (henceforth “angry-to-
ambiguous”) or fully happy expression (henceforth “happy-to-ambiguous”). Compared to
earlier studies with neutral faces as endpoints (Jellema et al., 2011; Marian & Shimamura,
2013; Palumbo & Jellema, 2013), the use of ambiguous faces provided a more ecologically
valid transition between anger and happiness, as “real” faces typically portray features of
multiple emotions rather than a single or “blank” expression (Aviezer et al., 2008; Hassin et
al., 2013). After each animation, a probe of the same avatar was exhibited, depicting either
the same expression (i.e., ambiguous) or one slightly displaced towards a more angry/happy
expression by one, two or three frames (Fig. 1). In each trial, participants were asked to make
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
equal/different judgements (first-order task) and to rate how confident they felt of their
response (second-order task). The second-order task was added to provide a quantitative
measure of metacognition, related to the sense of being correct about one’s perceptions,
memories, and decisions (see Fleming et al., 2012; Heyes et al., 2020). A forward bias
(consistent with RM) occurred when probes depicting an emotion intensity beyond the final
frame, in the direction of the anticipated motion (e.g., slightly angrier probes in happy-to-
ambiguous conditions) were incorrectly judged as “equal”. Conversely, a backward bias
(opposite to RM) occurred when probes showing a previous emotional state (i.e., slightly
happier probes in happy-to-ambiguous conditions) were incorrectly judged as “equal”.
Schizotypal traits were assessed with the SPQ. The participant sample was divided
into high and low SPQ groups by a median split of the total questionnaire score (e.g., Ahn et
al., 2020). With respect to the first-order task, we expected a main effect of Emotion, with a
greater RM effect for happy-to-ambiguous than angry-to-ambiguous faces. Since happy-to-
ambiguous faces display gradual increases in anger (and decreases in happiness), this would
be consistent with a larger forward bias for potentially threatening events, as suggested by
prior research (Greenstein et al., 2016). Moreover, we anticipated a significant SPQ Group by
Emotion interaction. Specifically, we hypothesized that the high (versus low) SPQ group
would demonstrate larger RM for happy-to-ambiguous faces, thus supporting previous
reports of an enhanced threat anticipation in schizophrenia (e.g., Kvarta et al., 2021) and
psychotic proneness (e.g., Paetzold et al., 2022; Reininghaus et al., 2016). Considering the
evidence indicating overconfidence in emotion perception errors in schizophrenia (e.g.,
Köther et al., 2018; Perez et al., 2020) and cognitive domains at a subclinical level, such as
delusional ideation (see Hoven et al., 2019), we also anticipated a main effect of SPQ Group
in the second-order task, thus revealing a tendency towards overconfidence in biased
perceptual judgements in the high SPQ group. Lastly, we also expected a significant SPQ
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
Group by Emotion interaction in the second-order task, such that group difference would be
greater for happy-to-ambiguous faces (compared to angry-to-ambiguous), suggesting greater
or specific overconfidence in threat appraisals.
Finally, we implemented an ambiguity threshold task, which involved categorizing
the emotion portrayed by the male and female avatars using a two-alternative forced-choice
staircase method. Unlike the main task, each stimulus was presented statically, representing a
specific point along the full spectrum of anger-happiness intensity. This enabled the
assessment of the ambiguity threshold for each participant and avatar face, thus accounting
for individual variation. Hypotheses, sample size, study design, and analysis plan are
2. Methods
2.1.Sample Size Justification
Sample size was calculated using a simulated power analysis with the
ANOVA_Power Shiny App (Lakens & Caldwell, 2021), with 2000 simulations and an alpha-
level of .05. We defined a mixed 2 × 2 design with Group (high SPQ, low SPQ) as between-
subjects factor and Emotion (happy-to-ambiguous, angry-to-ambiguous) as within-subjects
factor. We were mainly interested in the Group by Emotion interaction. Assuming the high
SPQ group would have a mean of 0.45 for happy-to-ambiguous and -0.1 for angry-to-
ambiguous trials, while the low SPQ group would have a mean of 0.2 for happy-to-
ambiguous and 0.1 for angry-to-ambiguous trials, we estimated that 52 participants per
group (N = 104) are necessary to obtain 81% power for the three-way interaction.
2 For the low SPQ group, happy-to-ambiguous and angry-to-ambiguous means were defined based on a pilot
testing with two volunteers. Then, those values were considered to estimate the means for the high SPQ group,
assuming that people with high schizotypal traits are more prone to perceive anger overall, especially in faces
transitioning from happiness to ambiguity. For a discussion on potential issues associated with this approach,
please refer to subsection 4.4.

2.2.Participants
Participants were recruited from the University campus through social media
platforms, flyers, and mailing lists. Participants were all Portuguese speakers, aged between
18 and 40 years, and with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Exclusion criteria were a)
failure to understand instructions and procedures; b) self-report of medical or neurological
disorders that may affect brain function (e.g., history of seizures, head trauma with
unconsciousness for >15 min); c) formal diagnosis of mental disorders; d) formal diagnosis
of psychotic disorders in biological first-degree relatives; e) and current psychotropic
medication intake.
A total of 114 participants (81 women; 71.05%) were recruited. Of those, five were
excluded for having a formal diagnosis of mental disorder, three for not completing the
questionnaires, one for not understanding the instructions, and one for computer errors. The
sample included 104 participants (73 women; 70.19%), aged between 17 and 39 (M = 21.48;
SD = 4.18). All procedures were approved by the university Ethics Committee (03-
CED/2020) and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki
and the American Psychological Association. Participants received either course credits
(Psychology students) or a stamp for a 5€ voucher in return for participation.
2.3.Measures
Groups were divided based on the total score of the Portuguese version of the SPQ
(Paixão & Quelhas, 2013), a self-report questionnaire to screen the general population for
Schizotypal Personality Disorder (Raine, 1991). The SPQ contains 74 items with
dichotomous response format (yes/no), distributed across nine dimensions that can be merged
into three factors based on the three-factor model of schizotypy (Raine et al., 1994):
cognitive-perceptual (ideas of reference, odd beliefs or magical thinking, unusual perceptual
experiences, suspiciousness), interpersonal (social anxiety, lack of friends, constricted affect,
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
suspiciousness), and disorganized (odd or eccentric behaviour, odd speech). The factor
scores, dimension scores, and total score are derived by summing the "yes" responses across
all items. Total scores range from 0 to 74, with higher scores indicating higher schizotypal
traits. Our sample showed acceptable levels of internal consistency, with a Cronbach’s alpha
of 0.90 for total score and between 0.63 and 0.81 for the nine dimensions.
For a more comprehensive assessment of psychotic proneness, we also included
measures of psychotic-like experiences that may manifest at a subclinical level. For that, we
used the Portuguese version of the Launay-Slade Hallucination Scale-Revised (LSHS-R;
Castiajo & Pinheiro, 2017) to evaluate different forms of hallucinations, and the Portuguese
version of the Peters et al. Delusional Inventory (PDI-21; Pimentel et al., 2017) to evaluate
the multidimensionality of delusional ideation. Additionally, we used the Portuguese version
of the State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA; Barros et al., 2022)
to statistically control for the effects of state-anxiety (STICSA-1) and trait-anxiety (STICSA-
2).
Lastly, a brief cognitive assessment was performed using the Portuguese version of
the Trail Making Test Part A (TMT-A; Cavaco et al., 2013) and the Letter-Number Span
(Wechsler, 2008). See Supplementary Materials for a more detailed description of the
measures.
2.4.Stimuli
A particular strength of this study lies on the use of avatar stimuli, which enabled
precise control over low-level features (e.g., symmetry of morphology and expression,
alignment of eyes and most face elements, closed mouth) and emotion changes in facial
expression. Two male and two female avatar faces (front view) with neutral expressions were
created with FaceGen Modeler 3.5.3 (Singular Inversions Inc.) using the following setup: a)
European race, b) 30 years of age, c) average shape and texture on the caricature scale, d) full
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
symmetry, and e) gender shape to “very male” or “very female”. Avatar faces were saved and
imported into FacsGen (Krumhuber et al., 2012).
For each avatar, a 100% angry expression (AU4 Brow lowerer = 100%, AU5 Upper
lid raiser = 100%, AU7 Lids tightener = 50%, AU9 Nose wrinkle = 30%, AU23 Lip tightener
= 100%) and a 100% happy expression (AU6 Cheek raiser = 100%, AU12 Lip corner puller
= 100%) were created (all with closed mouth), as well as 19 gradual transitions between them
(Fig. 1A). This resulted in 21 pictures per avatar (84 stimuli in total). The intermediate
stimulus corresponded to an ambiguous expression, with 50% anger and 50% happiness. All
emotion changes were made based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS; Ekman et al.,
2002) by a certified FACS coder using FacsGen. For similar procedures see Korb et al.
(2023)
Fig. 1. Example of the 21 static facial expressions of a male avatar (Panel A) used to create the angry-to-
ambiguous and happy-to-ambiguous animations (Panel B) and the corresponding probes (Panel C).
2.5.Probe Judgement Task
Experimental tasks were programmed with PsychoPy3 (Peirce et al., 2019). Each trial
started with a white fixation cross, for a random duration of 800 to 1200 ms, followed by a
sequence of avatar faces, gradually changing from a fully angry to an ambiguous expression
(angry-to-ambiguous) or from a fully happy to an ambiguous expression (happy-to-
ambiguous). Each animation contained eleven pictures (henceforth “frames”), all belonging
to the same avatar (Fig. 1B). The first frame (i.e., fully angry or happy expression) was
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
shown for 200 ms, followed by nine intermediate frames presented for 80 ms each, and the
final frame for 200 ms (Fig. 2). Importantly, the final frame always displayed an ambiguous
expression, irrespective of the emotion condition. Following each animation, a mask (a
pixelated picture of the final frame) was presented for 250 ms, succeeded by a probe that
remained visible until participants’ response (for similar procedures see Dozolme et al., 2018;
Hudson et al., 2016; Prigent et al., 2018). The probe was a static face of the same avatar,
depicting the same expression as the final frame (i.e., ambiguous) or one slightly displaced
towards an angrier or happier expression by one, two, or three frames, thus producing seven
levels per animation (Fig. 1C).
All stimuli were presented at 13º of visual angle, corresponding to the perceived
dimension of a human face at about 100 cm distance – the average personal space during
social interactions with an unfamiliar person (Hecht et al., 2019). Participants were required
to judge if the facial expression depicted by the probe was “equal to” or “different from” the
final frame of the animation, by pressing the “up” or “down” keys on the keyboard,
respectively. No feedback was provided. Immediately after response, participants indicated,
from 1 (“not confident”) to 4 (“very confident”), how confident they were in their response,
by pressing the “1”, “2”, “3” or “4” keys on the keyboard (Fig. 2).
The probe judgement task contained 168 trials (2 Emotion × 2 Avatar Sex × 2 Avatar
Identity × 7 Probe × 3 repetitions) and was preceded by 5 training trials, all in a randomized
order. None of the stimuli used in the training trials were shown in the main task.

2.6.Ambiguity Threshold Task
Participants completed an interleaved staircase task to estimate the ambiguity
threshold for each participant and avatar, using static stimuli. In each trial, a white fixation
cross was shown at the center of the screen, for a random duration of 800 to 1200 ms,
followed by one of the static pictures used to create the animations of the probe judgement
task. All stimuli were presented at 13º of visual angle. Participants indicated whether the
avatar face depicted anger or happiness, by pressing the “l” or “a” key on the keyboard,
respectively. No feedback was provided. Emotion intensity (21 pictures per avatar) gradually
changed towards greater anger or happiness based on the last response in each stair,
following a 2-up, 2-down rule: after two successive angry or happy responses, emotion
intensity changed towards a fully angry or happy expression. Two randomly interleaved stairs
per avatar were used, one starting with a fully angry and one with a fully happy expression.
Furthermore, the size of intensity steps each time a stair was presented was three pictures
before the first reversal and one picture afterwards. Each stair ended after a minimum of four
reversals (constrained to a minimum of five presentations per stair).
2.7.Procedures
After signing the consent form and completing the STICSA-1 (in paper), participants
were seated upright, as comfortably as possible, in front of an LG 24GL650-B monitor (1920
× 1080 pixels resolution; 100 Hz refresh rate), with its center located 60 cm from
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
participants’ forehead. They were asked to gaze at the fixation cross before stimulus
presentation. Participants performed the probe judgement task, followed by the ambiguity
threshold task. Tasks were ran in PsychoPy3 and lasted about 20 and 10 min, respectively.
Response time (ms) and response key were recorded in both tasks. Next, participants
completed the sociodemographic questionnaire, the SPQ, LSHS, PDI, and STICSA-2 (in the
Lastly, participants were fully debriefed about the purposes of the study and were rewarded
for their participation.

were considered outliers and excluded from analyses (N = 29; 0.16%). Data were pre-
processed in R (Version 4.2.1; R Core Team, 2022) using RStudio (RStudio Team, 2022),
results were saved as .xlsx using the writexl package (Ooms, 2021), and analysed in jamovi
(Version 2.3; The Jamovi Project, 2022). We used the ggpubr package (Kassambara, 2020)
for data visualization.
Concerning the first-order task, the main analysis consisted of a 2 × 2 repeated-
measures ANOVA with SPQ Group (between-subjects factor) and Emotion (within-subjects
factor). Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied in case of violation of sphericity,
assessed via the Mauchly’s test. Post-hoc analyses with Tukey correction for multiple
comparisons were computed, and alpha-level was set to 0.05. Dependent variables were Point
of Subjective Equality (PSE) and Just Noticeable Difference (JND), both estimated by fitting
a logistic probability density function to the proportion of “equal” responses (with three free
parameters: distribution mean, which provides the PSE estimate, distribution deviation,
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
which allows for an estimation of JND, and a scaling factor; for a similar procedure see
Dozolme et al., 2018). The PSE provided an estimation for the probe level for which
participants were more likely to respond “equal”. Thus, a PSE equal to 11 (corresponding to
the animation endpoint) suggests an accurate mnesic representation of the final frame. In
contrast, a PSE larger than 11 suggests a forward bias, while a PSE smaller than 11 a
backward bias.
Given the reported implicit effect of face sex on emotion perception (Becker et al.,
2007; Hess et al., 2009; Korb et al., 2023) and women’s advantage in recognizing emotional
faces (e.g., Bek et al., 2022), two exploratory repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted to
test the effects of sex. Those were composed by Emotion and Avatar Sex (within-subjects
factor) or Participant Sex (between-subjects factor). Should any effects of sex emerge, the
respective variable would be included in the analyses. We also controlled for the effects of
total SPQ, disorganized SPQ, cognitive-perceptual SPQ and interpersonal SPQ factors, using
these variables individually as covariates in repeated-measures ANOVAs with Emotion.
Total PDI and LSHS (to control for the effects of psychotic-like experiences), total STICSA-
1 and STICSA-2 (to control for the effects of state-anxiety and trait-anxiety, respectively),
and TMT-A and Letter-Number Span (to control for the effects of cognition) were also
individually added as covariates. All covariates were mean centred.
3 In the preregistration, the dependent variable consisted of a weighted mean RM, in which the sum of the
product of the proportion of “equal” responses and the probe level was divided by the sum of the proportion of
“equal” responses. Despite its common usage in the RM literature (e.g., Munger, 2015; Thornton, 2014), we
found that this method did not effectively identify outliers in our study: the weighted mean necessarily falls
within the range of -3 to 3 (representing the “distance” between the endpoint and the angriest or happiest
probes), which could inadvertently hide issues within the data, such as noise or a random distribution of “equal”
responses. For instance, in the case of one participant (ID93), the weighted mean was -0.54 for happy-to-
ambiguous faces and -0.21 for angry-to-ambiguous faces. While these values may appear reasonable, the
response distribution did not follow a consistent pattern, with the proportion of “equal” responses varying
widely across different probe levels: 0.67, 0.67, 0.17, 0.58, 0.33, 0.50, and 0.17 for probe levels 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, and 14, respectively. Taking these considerations into account and in alignment with recommendations
provided during peer review, we chose to use PSE as dependent variable. This approach enabled us to identify
potential outliers and obtain a more robust estimate of the memory bias.
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
For the second-order task, we computed the mean of the product of the proportion of
“equal” errors and the confidence mean of “equal” errors. Only “equal” errors were used as
we aimed to investigate subjective confidence in the context of a perceptual bias. The main
analysis consisted of a repeated-measures ANOVA with Emotion and SPQ Group. The
effects of total SPQ, total PDI, total LSHS, total STICSA-1 and STICSA-2, TMT-A, and
Letter-Number Span were also controlled for, using these variables individually as covariates,
and two exploratory analyses with Avatar Sex and Participant Sex were performed (both
having Emotion as within-subjects factor).
2.8.2. Non-preregistered Analyses
Exploratory repeated-measures ANOVAs with distinct groups were computed for
both the first- and second-order task: “high” and “low” based on PDI and LSHS median split,
to further explore the effect of psychotic-like experiences, and “high” and “low” based on
SPQ tertiles, discarding the group with “medium” SPQ scores (for similar procedures see
Laycock et al., 2019). Spearman’s rank correlation was used to investigate whether PSE and
subjective confidence correlated with total SPQ, total PDI, and total LSHS, as well as
disorganized, cognitive-perceptual, and interpersonal SPQ factors.
Concerning the first-order task, we also ran a repeated-measures ANOVA to test the
effects of Probe Level and Emotion on the proportion of “equal” responses, serving as a
validation check. Moreover, a one-tailed one-sample t-test was performed to explore whether
PSE was significantly larger than 11 (corresponding to the animation endpoint).
Concerning the ambiguity threshold task, the ambiguity threshold was calculated as
the mean of the picture level where reversals (with a size intensity set of 1) took place.
Values below 11 suggest that faces with angrier than happier cues were perceived as being
4 Despite subjective confidence ranging between 1 and 4, descriptive analysis showed little variation within our
sample (M=3.00, SD=0.39, Min=2.05, Max=3.94). Therefore, the preregistered analysis was not feasible, as it
would reflect the outcomes obtained in RM. Weighted confidence mean was used instead.
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
ambiguous. Firstly, a two-tailed one-sample t-test was performed to explore whether the
ambiguity threshold was significantly different from 11 (the intermediate level of emotion
change). Secondly, a repeated-measures ANOVA with Avatar Sex and SPQ Group was
conducted. The ambiguity threshold was also correlated with total SPQ, total PDI, and total
LSHS, as well as disorganized, cognitive-perceptual, and interpersonal SPQ factors. Lastly,
JND was computed and used as dependent variable in a repeated-measures ANOVA with
Avatar Sex and SPQ Group.
3. Results
3.1.Representational Momentum
Since exploratory analyses revealed no effect of Avatar Sex and Participant Sex on
PSE, these variables were excluded from further analyses. Upon visual inspection,
participants whose PSE for happy-to-ambiguous or angry-to-ambiguous faces fell below 5 or
exceeded 16 (deviating three levels beyond the more extreme probes) were excluded (N = 9;
8.65%), as their distribution of “equal” responses, within the probed range, did not follow a
consistent pattern. This step allowed a more reliable estimation of RM. The analysed sample
thus comprised 95 participants (67 women; 70.53%), whose age ranged from 18 to 39 years
(M = 21.50; SE = 0.43). Of those, 46 participants were classified into the high SPQ group
and 49 into the low SPQ group. Sociodemographic, psychological, and cognitive
Concerning PSEs, we first found a significant main effect of Probe Level, F(6, 564) =
68.20, p < 0.001, η² = 0.420, a significant main effect of Emotion, F(1, 94) = 44.71, p <
0.001, η² = 0.322, and a significant Probe Level by Emotion interaction, F(6, 564)=6.69, p <
0.001, η² = 0.066. As the probe level approached 11 (representing the animation endpoint),
the proportion of “equal” responses increased for angry-to-ambiguous faces (M = 0.78; SE =
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
0.02; 95% CI [0.74, 0.82]), while the peak proportion occurred at probe level 12 for happy-
to-ambiguous faces (M = 0.66; SE = 0.02; 95% CI [0.61, 0.70]) (Fig. 3).
Fig. 3. Proportion of “equal” responses as a function of Probe Level (data points), with Emotion as the curve
parameter. The lines depict the best fitting logistic probability density functions for each Emotion. Probe Level
11 corresponds to the animation endpoint, portraying a 50% happy and 50% angry expression. Probe Levels 8,
9, and 10 depict facial expressions occurring 3, 2, and 1 frames before the endpoint, respectively. Conversely,
Probe Levels 12, 13, and 14 illustrate the anticipated continuation beyond the endpoint, by 1, 2, and 3 frames,
respectively. Error bars represent standard errors of the mean.
A one sample t-test revealed that PSE was significantly larger than 11 for happy-to-
ambiguous faces (M = 11.36; SE = 0.11; 95% CI [11.13, 11.58]), t(94) = 3.11, p = 0.001, d =
0.319, 95% CI [0.112, 0.524], but not angry-to-ambiguous faces (M = 11.09; SE = 0.14; 95%
CI [10.81, 11.36]), t(94) = 0.64, p = 0.263, d = 0.065, 95% CI [-0.136, 0.266] (Fig. 4).

distributions. Mean PSE values are indicated by triangle symbol. Jittered points represent individual data points.
Error bars represent standard errors of the mean. Results revealed that PSE was significantly larger than 11 (the
animation endpoint) for happy-to-ambiguous faces (p = 0.001), but not for angry-to-ambiguous faces (p =
0.263). **p < 0.010
Next, a repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of Emotion,
F(1, 93) = 4.69, p = 0.033, η² = 0.048. The PSE was significantly larger for happy-to-
ambiguous faces than angry-to-ambiguous faces. No main effect of SPQ Group, F(1, 93) =
0.06, p = 0.810, η² = 0.001, and no significant SPQ Group by Emotion interaction were
found, F(1, 93) = 2.18, p = 0.143, η² = 0.023 (Fig. 5).
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
Fig. 5. Violin plots with box plots displaying the distribution of PSE across the angry-to-ambiguous and happy-
to-ambiguous transitions, categorized by SPQ Group. Violin plots represent the probability density of PSE,
while box plots depict quartile distributions. Mean PSE values are indicated by triangle symbol. Jittered points
represent individual data points. Error bars represent standard errors of the mean.
PSEs were not affected by the covariates SPQ (total score, cognitive-perceptual
factor, interpersonal factor, and disorganized factor), total LSHS, total STICSA-1, total
STICSA-2, TMT-A, and Letter-Number Span (all p < 0.050) – the main effect of Emotion
remained unchanged in these analyses. Interestingly, the covariate total PDI significantly
interacted with Emotion, F(1, 93) = 4.42, p = 0.038, η² = 0.045, which suggests that the
main effect of Emotion on PSE varies depending on individuals’ scores on the PDI. To
further explore this, the sample was divided into low (N = 48) and high (N = 47) groups
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
based on the median split of PDI. Results showed a null PDI Group effect, F(1, 93) = 0.182,
p = 0.671, η² = 0.002. The PDI Group by Emotion interaction approached, but did not reach
the significance threshold, F(1, 93) = 3.84, p = 0.053, η² = 0.040. Particularly, the high PDI
group exhibited a significantly larger PSE for happy-to-ambiguous stimuli (M = 11.43; SE =
0.16; 95% CI [11.11, 11.76]) than angry-to-ambiguous faces (M = 10.92; SE = 0.19; 95% CI
[10.53, 11.30], p = 0.024). Conversely, the difference in PSE between happy-to-ambiguous
(M = 11.28; SE = 0.16; 95% CI [10.96, 11.60]) and angry-to-ambiguous faces in the low PDI
group was not statistically significant (M = 11.25; SE = 0.19; 95% CI [10.87, 11.64], p =
0.999).
To confirm whether the null effect of SPQ Group was caused by the median split not
providing enough granularity, the sample was also divided into two groups based on SPQ
tertile: high SPQ (N = 30) and low SPQ (N = 35). Consistent with earlier findings, the SPQ
Group by Emotion interaction failed to reach significance, F(1, 63) = 2.70, p = 0.105, η² =
0.041. Furthermore, Spearman’s rank correlation showed no significant correlation between
PSE and total SPQ (r = 0.129, p = 0.212), cognitive-perceptual SPQ (r = 0.097, p = 0.351),
interpersonal SPQ (r = 0.077, p = 0.461), disorganized SPQ (r = 0.145, p = 0.160), total
LSHS (r = 0.002, p = 0.984), and total PDI (r = -0.003, p = 0.976).
With respect to JND, descriptive analyses demonstrated that JND was greater for
happy-to-ambiguous (M = 2.18; SE = 0.63; 95% CI [0.92, 3.44]) than angry-to-ambiguous
faces (M = 1.60; SE = 0.08; 95% CI [1.45, 1.75]). However, this difference failed to reach
the statistical significance criterium, with results indicating the absence of significant effects
of Emotion, F(1, 93) = 0.78, p = 0.378, η² = 0.008, SPQ Group, F(1, 93) = 0.928, p = 0.338,
η² = 0.010, and the SPQ Group by Emotion interaction, F(1, 93) = 0.983, p = 0.324, η² =
p p
0.010.
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
Finaly, we tested the proportion of participants showing a RM greater than JND based
on their SPQ group. This allowed us to explore whether individuals with high schizotypal
traits demonstrated a tendency to anticipate emotions that exceeded their visual acuity for
detecting changes in emotion intensity. Since data did not follow a normal distribution based
on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we conducted a Chi-squared test. Results revealed no
significant association between the proportion of participants with RM greater than JND and
the SPQ group for both happy-to-ambiguous faces (nine of 46 participants in the high group;
seven of 49 participants in the low group), χ²(1) = 0.47, p = 0.492, and angry-to-ambiguous
faces (two of 46 participants in the high group; three of 49 participants in the low group),
χ²(1) = 0.15, p = 0.699.
3.2.Subjective Confidence
Concerning weighted confidence, neither a main effect of SPQ Group, F(1, 93) =
0.10, p = 0.752, η² = 0.001, nor a significant Group by Emotion interaction, F(1, 93) = 1.49,
p = 0.225, η² = 0.016, was found. Nevertheless, the effect of Emotion reached significance,
F(1, 93) = 46.09, p < 0.001, η² = 0.345: the weighted confidence for angry-to-ambiguous (M
= 1.76; SE = 0.06,;95% CI [1.65, 1.88]) was significantly larger than happy-to-ambiguous
faces (M = 1.42; SE = 0.05; 95% CI [1.32, 1.52]). Null effects of SPQ were also observed
upon splitting the high and low group based on tertile split (all p > 0.05).
When they were added individually as covariates, the SPQ (total score and factors),
total PDI, total LSHS, total STICSA-1, total STICSA-2, and total TMT-A did not have
significant effects (all p < 0.05). The main effect of Emotion remained unchanged, with the
exception of a null effect using the interpersonal SPQ factor, p = 0.357, η² = 0.009, and the
TMT-A as covariates, p = 0.363, η² = 0.009. Moreover, when using the Letter-number Span
as covariate, results showed a main effect of memory, F(1, 93) = 6.79, p = 0.011, η² = 0.068,
and a significant Emotion by Letter-number Span interaction, F(1, 93) = 7.86, p = 0.006, η²
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
= 0.078, while the effect of Emotion did not reach statistical significant, F(1, 93) = 0.90, p =
0.344, η² = 0.010.
Additional analyses with Emotion and Group divided by median split of PDI and
LSHS revealed neither a main effect nor a significant interaction with Group for both PDI
and LSHS (all p < 0.05). Lastly, Spearman’s rank correlation showed no significant
relationship between weighted confidence and total SPQ (r = -0.006, p = 0.952), cognitive-
perceptual SPQ (r = -0.028, p = 0.790), interpersonal SPQ (r = 0.006, p = 0.957),
disorganized SPQ (r = -0.017, p = 0.873), total LSHS (r = -0.108, p = 0.298), and total PDI (r
= -0.070, p = 0.500).
3.3.Ambiguity Threshold
Slightly angrier female faces (M = 10.12; SE = 0.16; 95% CI [9.81, 10.43]) and
slightly angrier male faces (M = 10.30; SE = 0.16; 95% CI [10.00, 10.61]) were perceived as
ambiguous. The ambiguity threshold was statistically different from 11 in both female, t(94)
= -5.68, p < 0.001, d = -0.583, 95% CI [-0.799, -0.364], and male faces, t(94) = -4.46, p <
0.001, d = -0.458, 95% CI [-0.668, -0.245]. There were no main effects of SPQ Group, F(1,
93) = 1.14, p = 0.289, η² = 0.012, or Avatar Sex, F(1, 93) = 1.79, p = 0.184, η² = 0.019, and
p p
no significant SPQ Group by Avatar Sex interaction, F(1, 93) = 0.14, p = 0.705, η² = 0.002.
Spearman’s rank correlation demonstrated a positive correlation between the ambiguity
threshold and the cognitive-perceptual SPQ (r = 0.222, p = 0.030), but not total SPQ (r =
0.083, p = 0.422), interpersonal SPQ (r = 0.083, p = 0.425), disorganized SPQ (r = -0.127, p
= 0.221), total LSHS (r = 0.122, p = 0.240), and total PDI (r = 0.157, p = 0.129).
Similar to RM analyses, JND was computed and used as dependent variable.
Descriptive analyses demonstrated that JND was greater for female (M = 0.94; SE = 0.5;
95% CI [0.85, 1.03]) than male faces (M = 0.89; SE = 0.05; 95% CI [0.81, 0.98]). Still, the
repeated-measures ANOVA revealed no main effects of Avatar Sex, F(1, 93) = 0.68, p =
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
0.412, η² = 0.007, and SPQ Group, F(1, 93) = 2.30 p = 0.132, η² = 0.024, and no significant

SPQ Group by Avatar Sex interaction, F(1, 93) = 0.46, p = 0.499, η² = 0.005.
4. Discussion
In this study, we aimed to explore, for the first time, emotional anticipation in
response to dynamic emotional faces and its potential association with schizotypal traits, thus
contributing to the understanding of dynamic emotion perception along the psychotic
continuum. To achieve this, we conducted a probe judgement task with angry-to-ambiguous
and happy-to-ambiguous faces, measuring PSE and JND (first-order task), alongside with
subjective confidence (second-order task).
4.1.Increased Anticipation of Threat
We first observed a forward bias for happy-to-ambiguous faces, with the PSE being
significantly larger than 11. However, such bias was not evident for angry-to-ambiguous
faces, where the PSE remained statistically similar to 11. Consistently, there was a distinct
pattern in the distribution of “equal” responses, characterized by a peak occurring one level
beyond the endpoint for happy-to-ambiguous faces, and at the endpoint for angry-to-
ambiguous faces. These findings suggest that an ambiguous face is consistently misperceived
as angrier when the emotional face began with a happy expression. As JND analyses revealed
that emotion did not influence participants’ visual precision for detecting a change in facial
expression, the significantly larger PSE observed in happy-to-ambiguous than angry-to-
ambiguous faces may suggest that observers remained confident in their perceptual
judgement despite experiencing a perceptual bias.
Although we also anticipated a significant, albeit smaller, forward bias for angry-to-
ambiguous faces, our findings confirm Greenstein et al.’s (2016) study, in which moving
objects signaling a presumable social threat generated greater forward displacement than
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
neutral objects. According to the authors, this effect may facilitate a more efficient
anticipation of the trajectory and/or action of a threatening stimulus. Indeed, visual and
cognitive biases are consistently observed in response to (static) threatening stimuli, such as
pictures of snakes and angry humans (e.g., Cole et al., 2013; Gomes et al., 2018; Leibovich et
al., 2016; Öhman et al., 2012; Soares et al., 2014). These biases are thought to enhance the
detection and reaction to an imminent danger (see Öhman, 2005). For instance, the perceived
distance between an observer and an aggressive human is significantly smaller compared to
disgusting and neutral humans (Cole et al., 2013). Hence, instead of eliciting an optimal
memory representation, dynamic emotional faces with a perceptual history compatible with
an impending state of anger appear to consistently trigger systematic memory distortion,
leading to heightened anger anticipation. This may reflect an adaptative mechanism, as it is
safer to anticipate any hostility from a conspecific than the opposite.
Besides this anger anticipation, a possible explanation could be that angrier
(compared to happier) probes are more often selected, irrespective of their perceptual history.
But this would likely lead to a backward shift for angry-to-ambiguous faces, which was not
the case: although it did not reach statistical significance, the PSE was still larger than 11.
Furthermore, if there were disparities in emotion or physical changes between angrier and
happier probes, this could potentially lead to a main effect of Emotion, not directly related to
RM. This scenario is improbable, given that avatar stimuli allow for more controlled and
precise adjustments of anger-happiness intensity and that equidistant probes were similar in
terms of pixel-wise difference between them and the animation endpoint (see Supplementary
Materials).
4.2.Null Effect of Schizotypal Traits in Representational Momentum
With respect to the effect of schizotypal traits, no significant difference emerged
between the high and low SPQ groups in terms of PSE and JND. The obtained results failed
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
to substantiate our hypothesis that individuals with high (compared to low) schizotypal traits
would show a greater RM, especially concerning happy-to-ambiguous faces. Further analyses
also revealed no main effect or correlation with cognitive-perceptual, interpersonal, and
disorganized schizotypal traits, nor with hallucination predisposition or delusional ideation
(evaluated with the LSHS and PDI, respectively). These results suggest that individuals with
psychotic proneness, at a subclinical level, maintain their ability to anticipate others’
emotions, even when confronted with a likely imminent angry state. Similarly, Jarret et al.
(2002) found a comparable forward displacement among individuals with high (N = 8) and
low schizotypal traits (N = 8) for non-emotional stimuli. Despite a probable lack of statistical
power due to the small sample size, their findings may still reflect typical motion
extrapolation patterns in schizotypy. This contrasts with Vettise’s study (2012), which
reported a positive correlation between RM and the disorganized factor of the SPQ. Vettise
proposed that individuals with disorganized schizotypy may have an erratic cognitive
representation of the world, potentially hindering the inhibition of automatic motion
extrapolation processes. However, due to the weak correlation (r = 0.13), RM alone was not
considered a robust marker of psychotic proneness. With this in mind, it is thus possible that
schizotypal traits may not have a significant impact on motion extrapolation or anticipation
processes.
While we did not observe an effect of SPQ group in the ambiguity threshold task for
either PSE and JND, there was a positive correlation between the cognitive-perceptual SPQ
factor and the ambiguity threshold. This may suggest that, when faces are presented
statically, higher self-reports of positive schizotypy (e.g., suspiciousness, ideas of reference,
unusual perceptual experiences) are associated with an ambiguity threshold slightly biased
towards a happier expression. In other words, individuals with higher levels of positive
schizotypy may tend to require more happy cues to judge a face as ambiguous. This aligns
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
with previous descriptions of a threat-related bias for neutral faces in individuals at ultra-high
risk (e.g., Seo et al., 2020; van Rijn et al., 2011) and in high schizotypal traits (e.g., Brown &
Cohen, 2010), which also aligns with the hypothesis that psychotic experiences, namely
persecutory delusions, are associated with an exaggerated threat perception in ambiguous
events (see Green & Phillips, 2004). Importantly, the positive correlation between the
cognitive-perceptual SPQ and the ambiguity threshold, alongside the null effect of
schizotypal traits in RM, could imply that positive schizotypy is linked to an anger bias for
ambiguous faces solely when an explicit discrimination of emotion is required, and that this
association does not persist when a more automatic emotion perception process is engaged. In
fact, distinct meta-analyses have consistently shown impaired emotion recognition in
schizophrenia (Kohler et al., 2010; Savla et al., 2013), but evidence is mixed for paradigms
less susceptible to the interference of higher-level social cognition (e.g., Caruana & Seymour,
2021; Grave et al., 2021; see Lee et al., 2016). On that note, it could be that the null effect of
schizotypal traits in RM was due to participants relying less on the emotion content per se to
make their same/different judgments, but more on the physical properties of the stimulus.
Nevertheless, this seems implausible given that the RM was affected by emotion – which
would not be the case if only physical properties were attended –, thus strengthening the idea
that our outcomes reflect intact emotional anticipation for socio-emotional events in
psychotic proneness. Still, caution is needed due to the weak strength of the correlation (r =
0.222, p = 0.030) and to the possibility of biased results when conducting multiple
correlations, as a higher number of tests increases the likelihood of finding a significant p
value by change alone. Indeed, despite evidence of abnormal emotion recognition in
schizotypal traits (see Giakoumaki, 2016; Zouraraki et al., 2022), this effect is far from being
robust, with some authors failing to find an association between facial emotion perception
and schizotypal traits (e.g., Toomey & Schuldberg, 1995; van’t Wout et al., 2004; Waldeck &
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
Miller, 2000). For instance, Rus-Calafell et al. (2013) showed no correlation between
schizotypal traits and emotion recognition for both static and dynamic face stimuli.
Although statistical significance was not reached, data visualization revealed a trend
for larger PSEs in the presence of happy-to-ambiguous faces in the high versus low SPQ
group. Similarly, we observed that the effect of Emotion on PSE varied depending on
individual scores of delusional ideation (assessed with the PDI), and that splitting the sample
into high and low delusional ideation (instead of high and low schizotypal traits) resulted in a
marginally significant interaction between emotion and PDI group, with data visualization
also showing a pattern of larger PSE for happy-to-ambiguous faces in the high than low PDI
group. Speculatively, the effect of psychotic-like experiences may be more extreme for
individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, perhaps leading to a significant difference between
clinical and nonclinical groups. This would suggest that exaggerated emotional (or anger)
anticipation occurs in the clinical manifestation of schizophrenia, but not at a subclinical
level. Further studies tackling this assumption are required. Additionally, De Sá Teixeira et
al. (2013) demonstrated that the effect of velocity in RM – with greater RM magnitude at
faster dynamics (see Hubbard, 2010, 2014) – is null in individuals with schizophrenia. Even
though they used non-emotional stimuli, it may be the case that the manipulation of velocity
enhances a potential effect of schizotypy. In this vein, we recommend future studies to test
this hypothesis; it was not considered here because adding velocity would significantly
increase the number of trials (due to the seven probe levels). Additionally, caution is needed
as it is also plausible that the study was underpowered and that a potential effect of psychotic-
like experiences would emerge with a larger sample.
Lastly, it is worth emphasizing that our use of the terms “high” and “low” refers to the
distribution of scores collected in the current sample, which lacks the desired variability to
derive stronger conclusions (M = 18.16; SD = 9.64), especially at the higher end of the scale
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
since the maximum value obtained in our sample was 39 out of 74. This could reflect a
selection bias since most of the recruited sample was composed of university students and
should be considered a limitation. Tentatively, a significant difference could emerge for
individuals scoring higher on the SPQ, closer to the higher end of the psychotic continuum. A
straightforward replication of the present study recruiting participants with a wider range of
SPQ scores emerges as a particularly relevant future direction. Also, it is possible that
participants have manipulated their self-report of psychotic-like experiences to please the
examiner or confirm to social norms/expectations, a phenomenon known as social desirability
bias (e.g., Holtgraves, 2004; Ladea et al., 2020). Although no reliable method has been
developed to measure schizotypal traits, a previous study successfully used a machine
learning technique to classify individuals with schizotypy based on electroencephalography
data collected during an audiovisual emotion perception task (Jeong et al., 2017). Therefore,
future studies could benefit from the use of more objective measures for discriminating
between “high” and “low” schizotypal groups.
4.3.Null Effect of Schizotypal Traits in Subjective Confidence
Concerning the second-order task, no significant difference was found between
individuals with high and low SPQ in their subjective confidence, and the Group by Emotion
interaction was also not significant. Thus, our hypothesis that the high SPQ group would be
overconfident, particularly for happy-to-ambiguous faces, was not supported. Despite
evidence of overconfidence along the psychotic continuum (e.g., Köther et al., 2012; Moritz
et al., 2014; Perez et al., 2020), this effect is not always observed (e.g., Faivre et al., 2021),
particularly at a subclinical level (e.g., Dawes et al., 2021; Köther et al., 2018). For instance,
Dawes et al. (2021) found only circumstantial evidence of an association between positive
schizotypy and confidence, while disorganized schizotypy significantly predicted
underconfidence for emotion recognition. Also, Köthler et al. (2018) showed a comparable
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
number of high-confidence emotion recognition errors in individuals with schizophrenia,
first-degree relatives, and individuals with depression, while individuals with attenuated
positive symptoms and healthy controls made significantly less high-confidence errors. This
suggests that the ability to predict one’s emotion recognition performance is preserved in
individuals with subclinical psychotic features, which may be the case in the present study.
Additionally, it is worth noting that this null effect can also be explained by the narrow
distribution of the SPQ scores in our sample, which prevented us from having two clearly
distinct “high” and “low” groups (even after using tertile to split the sample).
Interestingly, results showed that subjective confidence for biased perceptual
judgements was significantly lower for happy-to-ambiguous than angry-to-ambiguous faces,
a pattern opposite to the RM results. Since ambiguous faces were systematically
misperceived as angrier when preceded by happy faces, it is possible that the uncertainty of
the perceptual judgement increased, which in turn lowered subjective confidence. This aligns
with evidence that individuals can accurately predict their own perceptual performance (e.g.,
Keane et al., 2015). Gallagher et al. (2019) proposed that aftereffects driven by perceptual
changes (i.e., sensory adaptation) can be measured equally using decision and confidence
judgements, while aftereffects driven, at least in part, by non-perceptual factors (e.g., biased
pattern of responses when the input is ambiguous) result in a dissociation between decision
and confidence judgments. As such, measuring subjective confidence can be particularly
relevant as there presently is no consensus on the mechanisms underlying RM, with
theoretical models proposing a wide range of possible explanations related to mental
representations of physical properties (as the case of momentum or “mass in motion”, defined
as the product of the object’s mass and velocity), low-level factors (mostly linked to vision,
such as oculomotor behaviour, aftereffect, and perceptual adaptation), beliefs about physical
systems and objects in motion (such as extrapolation and implicit knowledge), and a
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
combination of all of these (see Hubbard, 2010). However, this question goes beyond the
scope of the present study.
4.4.Additional considerations
Although sample size was defined a priori and preregistered, the parameters
concerning the low SPQ group were established through a brief pilot test with two volunteers.
This has some potential issue as data from pilot tests may not fully represent the population
of interest, leading to a biased or incomplete estimation. Additionally, the parameters for the
high SPQ group were defined by us based on the hypothesis and range of RM values obtained
from the pilot test, instead of actual data from individuals with high schizotypal traits.
Consequently, the difference between the SPQ groups may have been overestimated. If so,
this could have resulted in an insufficient sample size and an underpowered study, especially
since nine participants (8.65% of total sample) were excluded from the analysis due to
excessive noise. To enhance the reliability and robustness of our findings, with particular
interest on the null effect of schizotypal traits, this study should be replicated with a larger
sample size.
An effect of schizotypal traits may not have been evident due to the only small-to-
medium magnitude of the forward bias observed in happy-to-ambiguous faces (d = 0.319 in
the one sample t-test; and η² = 0.048 for the main effect of Emotion), which contrasts with
the effects reported in previous studies. For example, Prigent et al. (2018) showed a main
effect of the facial expression of pain in PSE, with a η² of 0.59, thus representing a large
effect. Hence, it would have been useful to test the paradigm before endorsing the schizotypy
question and then adjust it as necessary, as our paradigm may have failed to induce large
forward biases due to various methodological decisions. As an example, each picture along
the angry-to-happy continuum encompasses a 5% shift in both anger and happiness,
reflecting only a modest degree of change. Upon examining the absolute pixel-wise
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
difference between the endpoint and each probe, it becomes apparent that the physical change
is subtle, varying from an average of 0.35% (in probes that are one step angrier or happier
than endpoint) to 0.97% pixel-wise difference (in probes that are three steps angrier or
happier than endpoint; see Supplementary Materials). Hence, while statistically significant,
the forward bias in happy-to-ambiguous faces corresponds to a minor trend towards
anticipating anger, potentially with limited implication beyond the laboratory setting. To
enhance the significance of the forward bias, we would need to increase the gap between the
endpoint and each probe while still observing a RM effect.
Another aspect worthy of consideration is the difference in duration of the first and
final frames, which lasted 200 ms compared to the 80 ms of other frames. While some
authors have also opted to extend the duration of the first and/or final frame (e.g., Palumbo et
al., 2015, 2018), others have maintained uniform presentation times for all frames within the
animation (e.g., Prigent et al., 2018; Thornton, 2014; Uono et al., 2014; Yoshikawa & Sato,
2008). Typically, a longer presentation time allows for a more detailed processing of facial
features and emotional cues, thereby enhancing emotion perception (e.g., Neath & Itier, 2014,
who found improvements with presentation duration ranging from 50 to 100 ms). While
initially perceived as beneficial – particularly given that individuals with schizophrenia (and
arguably individuals with psychotic proneness) may require longer stimulus exposition to
accurately perceive emotional cues –, we now recognize that the longer presentation time
may have lessened the perceptual bias. Specifically, a more detailed processing of the final
frame may have fostered a closer “match” between participants’ perception and the actual
stimulus. This highlights the importance of considering how presentation parameters can
influence perception and stresses the complexity of balancing methodological decisions to
minimize unintended effects while enhancing the validity and reliability of the findings.
EMOTIONAL ANTICIPATION AND SCHIZOTYPAL TRAITS
Lastly, the subjective ambiguity did not represent the actual point of ambiguity for
each stimulus, as the ambiguity threshold significantly differed from 11 for both male and
female avatars. Thus, it would be beneficial to conduct a calibration before the main task to
determine the perceptive ambiguity threshold for each participant and stimulus. This
approach would enable us to adjust the endpoint of each animation accordingly.
4.5.Conclusion
Ambiguous faces were found to be perceived differently depending on their
immediate perceptual history. Particularly, there was an increased tendency to anticipate
anger in ambiguous faces that began with happiness (happy-to-ambiguous faces), in line with
a greater RM for stimuli whose dynamics are congruent with an imminent threat.
Nevertheless, our preregistered hypothesis that this effect would be stronger in individuals
with high schizotypal traits was not supported, thus suggesting that emotional anticipation
might not be a potential marker of psychotic proneness. Lastly, we also did not observe a
significant overconfidence in biased perceptual judgments by individuals with high
schizotypal traits. Still, caution is essential when interpreting these findings, as a hypothetical
effect of schizotypal traits or other psychotic-like experiences may have been reduced due to
the use of self-report questionnaires, recruitment of university students, and/or a too small
sample.
Altogether, the results showed the usefulness and promising value of RM as a tool to
explore the perception of socio-emotional dynamic stimuli, mirroring the relevance of
dynamic information and time-unfolding events in social interactions, while opening research
avenues concerning emotional anticipation in the clinical manifestation of schizophrenia.
