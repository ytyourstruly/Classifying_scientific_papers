Today is the last day of 2022, and I’m counting down to the 2023 new year and my wedding
day. After the wedding day, many things will change, including myself and my surrounding
environment.
Tomorrow will be the day that I officially have a life-long companion (my dear Nguyễn Thị
Quỳnh Yến). So, I want to write a few lines to mark the last day of my single life and express
my hope for a bright future. I hope my wife and I will grow strong together by the values that
have shaped our identities and directions [1-11].
