SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 2
Abstract
Sexual motivation plays a crucial role in both normal sexual functioning as well as sexual
dysfunctions. Although many self-report questionnaires exist to assess sexual motivation,
their validity is restricted in that their sensitivity to experimental manipulation has not been
tested and that they are subject to self-report limitations (e.g., self-representational issues).
The aim of the current research is to develop and validate through experimental means a
measure of sexual motivation based on the content analysis of imaginative stories that
participants write about socially ambiguous pictures. In two studies (Study 1: N = 86; Study
2: N = 113), participants were randomly allocated to an erotic prime or control prime
condition and took a picture-story test before and after the presentation of the primes.
Subjective affect was assessed in both studies; physiological measures of affect
(pupillometry, facial electromyography) and a criterion measure of sexual motivation (key-
pressing for longer exposure to sexual vs. control pictures) only in Study 2. In both studies,
erotically primed participants showed an increase of sexual imagery in picture stories
compared to participants presented with control primes. In Study 2, this effect was mediated
by physiological measures of affect and mediated in turn the effect on the behavioral criterion
(viewing time for sexual pictures). We additionally report evidence for the discriminant,
convergent, and incremental validity of need for sex.

Developing a Causally Valid Picture-Story Measure of Sexual Motivation: I. Effects of
Priming
Sexual motivation is a fundamental motivational system, and substantial research has
been conducted. There is general agreement among researchers that sexual motivation is
incentive-based. Particularly, from an incentive-motivation point of view, sexual motivation
is a dynamic process (Agmo, 1999; Berridge, 2001; Bindra, 1978; Toates, 1986, 2009).
According to Bindra (1978) and Agmo (1999), both the central motive state and incentives
(i.e., affectively charged stimuli that elicit goal-directed, motivated behavior) generate
motivation. Particularly, the central motive state and the central nervous representation of
some characteristics of the incentive stimulus have a mutually exciting relationship. The
central motive state is influenced by internal states (such as previous exposures to sexual
incentives, past and current hormonal milieu, and inhibiting factors such as fear) that are not
motivating themselves but that have a gating function and determine how strongly an
incentive can trigger the central motive state. In this way, the central motive state makes the
individual more sensitive to the stimulus qualities of the incentive and the activation of the
representation of the incentive reinforces the central motive state. Thus, there is not only a
mutually exciting relationship between the central motive state and the incentive but also a
positive feedback loop.
To our knowledge, no measure of sexual motivation has been established yet that is
based on the incentive motivation model. The aim of the current two studies is therefore to
develop a measure of sexual motivation that exposes participants to sexual incentives and
assesses individual differences in motivational response to them, as revealed in their thematic
apperceptive responses to picture cues.
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 4
Validating motive measures
As early as in the fifties, McClelland (1958, 1987) argued that the central requirement
of validity is that a measure must be sensitive to experimental manipulation in the
phenomenon it aims to capture. Similarly, modern validity theory suggests that a measure is
only valid if the attribute it measures exists, and variations in this attribute cause variations in
the measure (Borsboom et al., 2004). To better understand this experimental-manipulation
approach, a commonly used example is the measurement of heat. The thermometer was
validated by showing that its immersion in cold water leads to a drop, and in boiling water to
an increase of its mercury column (Celsius, 1742). Subsequently, the thermometer was used
as a measure of the temperature of substances with unknown heat properties. In the context of
sexual motivation, this suggests that a measure should give lower readings under neutral
conditions, when no sexual incentives are present, and higher readings under sexually
arousing conditions, when sexual incentives are present. In a similar way that a thermometer
can be used to determine the characteristic temperature of substances, coding motive themes
in the picture-story exercise (PSE; McClelland et al., 1989) has been used to measure
dispositional differences in motive strength.
The PSE is the most commonly used measure to assess motives. Specifically, the PSE
relies on the analysis of written imaginative stories (i.e., fantasies) in response to ambiguous
pictures of social interactions (Pang, 2010). It reflects people’s spontaneous thought contents
in response to suitable eliciting cues and is assumed to be close to spontaneously emitted
behavior (Schultheiss & Schultheiss, 2014). PSE stories are content-coded with empirically
derived content-coding systems which were developed based on systematic differences in
stories written by individuals who were either experimentally aroused in a given motive or
not (Winter, 1998). For example, Winter (1973) used film clips to develop a coding system
for the need for power (nPower). In the experimental group, a movie of the 1961 inauguration
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 5
of President John F. Kennedy was used to arouse power motivation. In the control group, a
movie in which a businessman describes laboratory equipment was shown. Both groups were
then administered the same PSE. Winter later identified thematic differences between PSE
stories written under various arousal or non-arousal conditions and distilled them into content
coding rules. More generally, experimental arousal of a motivational state results in greater
imagery indicative of this specific state in PSE stories (Schultheiss et al., 2004), suggesting
that the PSE is sensitive to variations in motivation. Using this approach, researchers have
used PSE-based motive measures to predict a broad range of outcomes, from physiological
processes to societal changes (McClelland, 1987; Schultheiss & Köllner, 2021). We will use
a similar approach to develop a content-coding system that assesses sexual motivation, which
we term the need for sex (nSex) following the nomenclature established by Murray (1938).
In the present research, we extended the validation approach suggested by McClleland
(1958) and Borsboom et al, (2004) into an EMMIC framework (Schultheiss et al., in
preparation), retaining the central role of experimental manipulation to derive a measure, but
augmenting it with an indicator to verify the intended effect of the experimental manipulation
on the targeted process and a criterion to demonstrate the measure’s ability to predict a
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 6
EMMIC (experimental manipulation, measure, indicator, criterion) validation model
Note. The experimental manipulation of a motivational state has significant effects on the
affect-change indicator (a), the thematic content of the picture-story measure (b), and a
relevant behavioral criterion (c). The affect-mediation triangulation (red arrows) uses affect
change as an indicator to verify that motivation proper was aroused by the experimental
manipulation; affect change should therefore mediate the effect of arousal on the measure,
and controlling for a x d should render b’ < b. The measure-criterion triangulation (blue
arrows) aims to document that the portion of variance in the measure that is sensitive to
causal effects of motivation arousal is also the one that accounts for variance in a relevant
behavioral outcome, and controlling for b x e should therefore render c’ < c. From
Schultheiss et al., 2022.
Core indicator: Affect
Importantly, not all forms of experimentally manipulated thematic content changes
may reflect motivation and likewise, not all forms of goal-directed behavior are due to
motivation; only those that are guided by hedonic mechanisms (i.e., increase of pleasure,
reduction of displeasure) do (Berridge, 2001; Bindra, 1978; Hardy, 1964; Schultheiss, 2021).
Incentives and incentive motivation are affective at their core, and the response to as well as
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 7
pursuit of incentives are intrinsically guided by affective processes. Thus, effects of
experimental arousal on story content are necessary, but not sufficient for documenting a
measure’s validity, as story content variations may be due to non-motivational factors such as
attention, memory, or narrative complexity. We therefore argue for a triangulation between
experimental manipulation, the measure, and the indicator. Specifically, affect indicates
whether the manipulation succeeded in changing the targeted attribute (i.e., motivation) and
should mediate the effect of the experimental manipulation on the measure.
In the present research, we assess affect subjectively (self-reports; Studies 1 and 2)
and via psychophysiology (facial electromyography, pupillometry; Study 2). In Study 1,
subjective affect is assessed with a general state measure of approach motivation, avoidance
motivation, and evaluation of the outcome of the motivational process. In Study 2, more
specifically arousal and valence are assessed in response to erotic vs. control stimuli.
Psychophysiological affect is assessed with facial electromyography. Particularly, changes in
the corrugator muscle – the muscle located at the medial end of the eyebrow – show a bipolar
continuum, ranging from negative affective valuation of stimuli (maximally activated
corrugator) through a neutral midpoint (slightly activated corrugator) to positive affective
valuation of stimuli (maximally relaxed corrugator; Larsen et al., 2003). Corrugator
assessment is often complemented by assessment of the zygomaticus muscle – the muscle
that lifts the lip corners in a smile. The zygomaticus muscle has been shown to be active
when a person is presented with pleasurable stimuli but stays deactivated in response to
neutral or negative stimuli (e.g., Lang et al., 1993). These facial indicators of affect are
sensitive to the affective valence of visual and other types of stimuli and change in
predictable ways as a function of motivational states (Hoefling et al., 2009). Similarly, pupil
diameter increases when people are presented with emotionally engaging stimuli, albeit
regardless of hedonic direction. Specifically, pupils widen when participants view pleasant or
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 8
unpleasant, compared to neutral stimuli, if luminance, which also affects pupil diameter, is
controlled, or held constant (e.g., Bradley et al., 2008). Likewise, pupil dilation has been used
as an indicator of automatic responses, including sexual arousal (e.g., Laeng et al., 2012).
Subjective and psychophysiological responses to sexual (vs. neutral) stimuli will serve as
indicators of the activation of a motivational state due to the experimental manipulation and
as a mediator in analytical models of the effect of the manipulation on changes in picture
story content.
Criterion validity
For a measure of nSex to be valid not just in the sense of measuring the targeted
attribute (verified via the indicator) but also in terms of pragmatic usefulness, it needs to
predict relevant behavior. For sexual motivation, central real-world criteria would be
frequency of sexual activity and orgasm as well as the affective correlates accompanying
these events. And ultimately, it needs to be documented that nSex predicts such outcomes
(Pekarek et al., in preparation). However, in the context of the present research, which was
experimental and conducted in a laboratory, we used as a criterion how much effort (i.e.,
“wanting”) participants invested into having access to sexual stimuli relative to neutral
stimuli and the resulting differences in exposure times to these types of stimuli. Specifically,
we adapted a key-press task that was used successfully in past research on attractivity (e.g.,
Chelnokova et al., 2014; Parsons et al., 2011) and used it as a behavioral criterion measure in
triangulation between experimental manipulation, the measure, and the behavioral criterion,
where we assume that not only the direct effect but also the indirect effect is of importance.
Discriminant and convergent validity
We explored discriminant validity in the following ways: First, we tested whether our
motivational-arousal manipulation would be unique (see McClelland, 1958) by inducing
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 9
changes in nSex only or whether it would also extend to the motivational needs for power,
achievement, or affiliation, three frequently studied motives. An absence of motivational
arousal effects on these motives, combined with evidence for an arousing effect on nSex,
would support the specificity of the motivational-arousal manipulation we employed. Second,
we also examined the overlap of dispositional nSex (i.e., nSex assessed before the
experimental manipulation took place) with dispositional nPower, nAchievement, and
nAffiliation. Although motive measures derived from the same PSE rarely correlate exactly
zero with each other, correlations below |.20| are usually interpreted as evidence for
discriminant validity (e.g., Schönbrodt et al., 2021; Schultheiss & Brunstein, 2001). Third, we
examined the overlap between nSex and self-report measures of the Big Five traits (John &
Srivastava, 1999; Rammstedt & John, 2007), with the expectation that the two types of
measures would not converge, as has been observed in earlier research on other PSE-assessed
motives (Schultheiss & Brunstein, 2001). We examined convergent validity in Study 2 by
including two frequently used self-report measures of sexual motivation and behavior, the
sexual inhibition and excitation scales (SIS/SES; Carpenter et al., 2011) and the revised
sociosexual orientation inventory (SOI-R; Penke & Asendorpf, 2008). We expected nSex to
converge with the global score and all subscales of the SOI-R as well as with the sexual
excitation scale (SES) of the SIS/SES, as higher scores on these measures are all assumed to
reflect stronger positive motivation for sexual incentives. Our analyses were more
exploratory with regard to the inhibition scales of the SIS/SES. Crucially, despite the
predicted convergence of nSex with SES and SOI-R measures, we expected nSex to show
incremental validity over these measures in the prediction of our behavioral criterion
measure.
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 10
Overview of studies and hypotheses
Studies 1 and 2 test whether experimentally induced sexual motivation increases
sexual imagery in a picture story exercise. For this, participants were asked to write eight
imaginative stories in response to ambiguous pictures of social interactions. First, participants
wrote four stories without the presentation of primes (baseline phase) and then four stories
with the presentation of primes (priming phase). The experimental group was exposed to
erotic prime pictures and the control group was exposed to neutral prime pictures. Prime
stimuli were shown for either 30 or 500 milliseconds. Two sets of PSE pictures (A, B) were
created for each study in order to counterbalance the PSE stimuli. Subjective and
physiological affect in response to the prime stimuli was assessed. Ultimately, the main goal
of the current studies is to develop a coding system for nSex in order to measure sexual
motivation in a valid manner. The following hypotheses guided our research in both studies,
although some could only be tested fully in Study 2:
Hypothesis 1: Themes indicative of nSex will increase in the erotic-prime condition as
compared to a neutral-prime control condition. Specifically, we expect nSex to increase in the
erotic-prime condition from the baseline to the prime phase (H1a), but not in the control-
prime condition (H1b). Erotic-prime individuals will therefore also show higher nSex in the
priming phase than control-prime individuals (H1c); this effect should be absent in the
baseline (no-prime) phase (H1d). Overall, these effects constitute an expected significant
time (baseline, priming) x condition (erotic, neutral) interaction, providing evidence in favor
of McClelland’s (1958) sensitivity criterion and Borsboom et al.’s (2004) causal effect
criterion.
Hypothesis 2a: Subjective energetic arousal, tense arousal, and hedonic tone will
increase in the erotic-prime condition as compared to the control condition, constituting a
significant time (baseline, priming) x condition (erotic, neutral) interaction (Study 1).
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 11
Hypothesis 2b: Subjective arousal and hedonic responses will be higher in response to
erotic prime stimuli than in response to neutral prime stimuli (Study 2).
Hypothesis 3: Pupil size will be greater in response to erotic stimuli than to control
stimuli.
Hypothesis 4: Corrugator muscle activity will be lower in response to erotic stimuli
than in response to control stimuli.
Hypothesis 5: Zygomatic muscle activity will be greater in response to erotic stimuli
than in response to control stimuli. Hypotheses 2 through 5 provide a test of the expected
effect of the experimental manipulation on the affect indicator.
Hypothesis 6: Increases in arousal and hedonic responses (Hypothesis 2a and 2b),
pupil size and zygomatic activation (Hypotheses 3 and 5) as well as decreases in corrugator
activation (Hypothesis 4) in response to erotic versus neutral stimuli mediate the predicted
experimental-arousal effect on nSex. In their combination, hypotheses 2 through 6 represent a
Hypothesis 7: Erotically primed individuals will subsequently show longer viewing
time of erotic stimuli, relative to neutral stimuli, than control-prime individuals. This tests the
effect of the experimental manipulation on the criterion.
Hypothesis 8: nSex on the PSE predicts increased relative viewing time for erotic
stimuli.
Hypothesis 9: nSex mediates the effect of experimental condition on relative viewing
time for erotic stimuli. In their combination, hypotheses 7 through 9 represent a test of the
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 12
These hypotheses (except for Hypothesis 2b) were preregistered for Study 2
(AsPredicted #16735), but already guided our thinking and study design for Study 1 . Study 1
and 2 will also examine the sensitivity of nSex subcategories to the experimental
Derivation of a coding system: An overview
The main goal of the current studies is to develop a valid coding system for nSex;
however, such a coding system can depend substantially on PSE stimuli. Therefore, two
different sets of PSE pictures were used across studies to increase the coding system’s
generalizability. First, using PSE stories of Study 1, thematic differences between PSE stories
written under erotic or neutral conditions were identified and articulated as specific coding
rules. These coding rules were then fine-honed and expanded after the analysis of systematic
differences in PSE stories under the two conditions in Study 2. Then, all PSE stories from
both studies were content-coded based on the coding system from Study 2, and the research
presented here is based on this iteratively revised coding system. The strategy we applied was
to initially retain as many coding categories as possible. Only after inspection of each
category for (a) sufficient inter-coder reliability and (b) sensitivity for motivational-arousal
effects, combined with predicted associations with affect and criterion measures, we will
decide which categories are suitable for a finalized nSex coding system (Boyatzis, 1998). The
present research represents a first step in this direction.
1 The hypotheses described here deviate from the preregistration in the following ways: First, we have dropped
one hypothesis pertaining to an approach-avoidance task measure of sexual motivation after it became clear to
us that such a measure may be unsuitable for testing an association between nSex and behavior (see Janson et
al., 2021; Phaf et al., 2014). Second, our wording for the affect-mediation hypothesis in the preregistration
erroneously used the word “moderate” instead of mediate. Third, the preregistered hypothesis for testing
motivational-arousal effects on subjective arousal and hedonic responses deviated from all other hypotheses
concerning affect measures and also from the preregistered actual specification of associated statistical
procedures in that it targeted between-subject affect differences in the experimental and control conditions.
Although this procedure is suitable for Study 1, it does not fit the focus on within-subject comparisons of
affective responses to erotic and neutral stimuli in Study 2.

Method
Participants
Participants were 43 men and 43 women (N = 86), aged 18 to 45 years (M = 23.43,
SD = 3.74). Power analyses were based on power = .80 and an alpha level of .01, two-sided,
and suggested a sample size of n = 50 per group. 44 participants were in the erotic prime and
42 participants in the control prime condition. 85 participants self-identified as heterosexual
and one participant as bisexual. Participants were recruited through social media and postings
in the university setting of the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg.
Participation required being at least 18 years old and fluent in German. Participants received
15 Euro for their participation.
Design
The experiment had a 2 (Experimental Condition: erotic vs. control primes) x 2
(Prime Duration: 30 vs. 500 ms) x 2 (PSE Sequence: AB vs. BA) x 2 (Phase: baseline vs.
priming) design, with the first three factors varied between subjects and the last one varied
within subjects. PSE sequence served as a control factor and was intended to balance
whatever differences may exist a priori between sets A and B across levels of the other
factors. Participants were randomly allocated to the cells resulting from the between-subjects
factors. Dependent variables were sexual imagery in the picture stories and subjective affect.

SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 14
PSE pictures. Eight PSE pictures showed heterosexual couples in ambiguous social
interactions. They were selected based on their expected “pull” for nSex (Schultheiss & Pang,
2007), which means that they showed events that suggest the start of a social interaction that
may lead to sexual behavior but there is nothing overtly sexual about the image. Thus, it is
possible but not necessary that one writes a story that contains sexual imagery. Because the
precise pull properties of the pictures for nSex were not known initially, we created two sets
of pictures (A, B). Set A consists of the following pictures: woman blindfolding man
(Schultheiss et al., 2003); trapeze artists (Pang & Schultheiss, 2005); couple in field, showing
a man lying on the ground with his head in the lap of a woman who reads a book; and man on
couch, showing a man sitting on a couch and looking at a woman standing in front of him.
The latter two pictures were used here for the first time and taken from newsmagazines and
internet sources. Set B contains the following pictures: nightclub scene (Pang & Schultheiss,
2005) and the following three pictures that were used here for the first time: couple solving
crossword, showing a man looking at a crossword puzzle and a woman leaning over him and
pointing her finger on the crossword; man feeding woman, showing a man sitting next to a
woman and feeding her with spaghetti; and pillow fight, showing a man and woman in
underwear in bed and the woman throwing a pillow at the man. Within these sets, pictures
were presented in a randomized fashion for each participant. Upon request, the PSE pictures
can be shared.
Prime pictures. Prime pictures were selected from the International Affective Picture
System (IAPS; Bradley & Lang, 2007) based on their arousal scores (Lang et al., 2008). For
the erotic condition, the following 16 sexually arousing pictures were chosen: 4608, 4611,
4651, 4652, 4656, 4658, 4659, 4660, 4669, 4670, 4672, 4680, 4690, 4694, 4695, and 4800,
with a mean arousal rating of 6.45. For the control condition, the following 16 generally
arousing pictures were chosen: 8030, 8031, 8034, 8116, 8117, 8130, 8160, 8161, 8178, 8179,
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 15
8180, 8185, 8210, 8300, 8370, and 8490, with a mean arousal rating of 6.39. The mask that
was presented after the prime pictures appeared consisted of snippets of prime pictures where
no individuals or objects were identifiable.
Experimental Manipulation
Following standard instructions for computer administration (Schultheiss & Pang,
2007), participants worked on an 8-picture PSE. Four PSE pictures were presented before the
experimental manipulation (i.e., baseline phase) and four pictures were presented after the
experimental manipulation (i.e., priming phase) took place. In the baseline phase, on each of
the four trials, participants saw a mask for 70 ms, followed by a PSE picture. In the priming
phase, participants saw four randomly selected prime pictures, presented consecutively, that
were either displayed for 30 ms or 500 ms, each followed by a mask shown for 70 ms (see
and generally arousing non-erotic pictures were shown in the non-erotic priming condition.
During baseline and priming phases, PSE pictures were shown on a black background for 10
s and then replaced by a screen with writing instructions. Participants were asked to write
their stories into a window on the screen, with the guiding questions appearing above the
writing space (e.g., “What is happening?”, “Who are the persons?”). After 4 minutes, a text
appeared in the lower half of the screen asking the participants to finish the story and
continue with the next picture.
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 16
Baseline and Priming Phase Trial
Note. Example of baseline (left) and priming (right) phase trial. In both phases, attention-
capture concentric circles are presented first. In the baseline trial, a mask appears 4 times
followed by a PSE picture. In the priming trial, a prime picture is presented subliminally or
supraliminally before a mask appears (4 times with different prime pictures). Then the PSE
picture is presented.
nSex content coding. Following the lead of previously developed coding systems for
experiences a desire or need. It can be followed by positive and/or negative goal anticipation.
The person may then engage in instrumental activity in order to achieve the goal. Sometimes
obstacles (i.e., blocks within the person or outside in the world) can prevent goal attainment.
When the goal is achieved (or not), associated affective responses can be positive or negative.
Accordingly, the following eight categories were created: need for sex, positive goal
anticipation, negative goal anticipation, instrumental activity, obstacles, goal attainment, goal
affect, and a category called “others” that includes themes of sexual imagery that are more
contextual and do not easily fit the other categories. These superordinate categories are
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 17
further split into a total of 35 subcategories with precise definitions (e.g., positive goal
anticipation may be expressed as sexual potential, sexual arousal, sexual fantasies, or the
general positive expectation that one will soon have sex). These coding rules are described in
detail in an instruction manual which contains positive and negative coding examples, and all
coders adhered to this manual when coding. Specifically, three independent coders content
coded all PSE stories for nSex according to the coding system. According to Nunnally
(1978), interrater reliabilities of .70 or better are sufficient in early research stages. Interrater
reliabilities for the subcategories were, with very few exceptions, satisfactory (≥.70) to

Motivational Sequence
Content coding of other motives. All PSE stories were additionally coded by two
trained coders who had previously reached at least 85% agreement with an expert coder on
calibration stories for achievement, power, and affiliation imagery using Winter’s (1994)
manual for scoring motive imagery in running text. An example for achievement motivation
is a unique accomplishment like winning the Nobel Prize. An example for power motivation
is a strong, forceful action which inherently has an impact on others such as screaming which
makes another person cry. An example for affiliation motivation is an affiliative,
companionate activity like going for a walk with a partner. Interrater reliabilities were .75 for
achievement, .78 for power, and .86 for affiliation.
Subjective affect
We assessed subjective affective responses to experimental manipulations with the
UWIST Mood Adjective Check List (UMACL, Matthews et al., 1990), a self-report
questionnaire with 24 adjectives and a four-point Likert rating scale. Participants are asked to
mark the response that best reflects their current affective state, with 1 being “definitely” and
4 being “definitely not”. Each item starts with the statement “Right now I feel…”. The
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 20
UMACL consists of three subscales: hedonic tone assesses responses to motivational
outcomes (i.e., reward, frustration; e.g., “happy”, “sad”), energetic arousal measures positive
high activation associated with approach motivation (e.g., “active”, “passive”), and tense
arousal assesses feelings of tension associated with avoidance motivation (e.g., “anxious”,
“calm”). In our study, Cronbach’s alpha for hedonic tone before the PSE baseline phase was
.89 and after the PSE priming phase was .91, for energetic arousal before the baseline phase
was .87 and after the priming phase was .91, and for tense arousal before the baseline phase
was .88 and after the priming phase was .85. For the statistical analyses, all items were
(re)coded to be consistent with their scale name and the sum of the items for each subscale
used.
Forced choice task (FCT)
The FCT served to test to what extent primes presented for different durations were
accessible to conscious awareness. The structure of the FCT is identical to the experimental
manipulation where first a mask was presented and subsequently the prime stimuli. However,
instead of four priming stimuli, only one priming stimulus was presented. An additional
difference is that the priming stimulus was followed by a choice screen instead of a PSE
stimulus. Thus, participants were presented with an erotic or control prime stimulus for either
30 ms or 500 ms, depending on the condition participants were assigned to. Subsequently,
two stimuli of the same category were shown side by side, one of which is the stimulus
presented previously (32 trials). Afterwards, two stimuli of the two different categories were
presented side by side (32 trials). Participants then indicated which of the two stimuli they
had seen before by mouse click. They were encouraged to just guess if they were not sure.
When two stimuli of the same category were presented for 30 ms, participants responded on
average 68.01% (SD = 13.09) correctly, and when two stimuli of different categories were
shown, participants responded on average 69.57% (SD = 22.94) correctly. When two stimuli

of the same category were presented for 500 ms, participants responded on average 99.43%
(SD = 1.39) correctly, and when two stimuli of different categories were shown, participants
responded on average 99.79% (SD = 0.80) correctly.
Big Five Inventory (BFI)
The BFI (John & Srivastava, 1999) is a 44-item inventory that aims to assess the five-
facet model personality traits extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism,
and openness to experience. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1
“strongly disagree” to 5 “strongly agree”. Items start with the statement “I see myself as
someone who…” and are completed depending on the subscale. In our study, Cronbach’s
alpha for extraversion was .80, for agreeableness was .66, for conscientiousness was .72, for
neuroticism was .76, and for openness to experience was .83. For the statistical analyses, all
items were recoded and the sum of the items for each subscale used.
Procedure
Data collection took place from November to December 2008. Participants were
assessed individually in the Human Motivation and Affective Neuroscience (HuMAN)
laboratory at Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen, Germany. Upon arrival, participants
provided written consent for participating in the research and were then seated for all
subsequent testing at separate computer workstations, each equipped with a Windows PC, a
60 Hz LCD screen with 24-inch diameter, a keyboard, and a mouse. First, participants
collected a saliva sample for later hormone assaying (not part of this paper), and then
provided affect ratings before the baseline PSE (T1), and once before (T2) and once after
(T3) the priming phase. Then participants completed the FCT in the version that
corresponded to their experimental condition (30 or 500 ms, with either erotic or neutral
primes) after which they collected a second saliva sample. Lastly, participants were asked to
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 22
fill out the BFI and provide some demographic information. They were debriefed and
received their monetary compensation.
Results
All statistical analyses of Study 1 use the a priori nSex (AP nSex) score. Namely, the
AP nSex score is based on (the sum of) all subcategories except for the negative
subcategories (i.e., negative goal anticipation, negative instrumental activity, block, negative
affect). In Study 2, we created optimized nSex scores (based on the experimental arousal
effect of Study 1 and Study 2 and affect mediation of Study 2) that will be used in addition to
the AP nSex score.

Exploratory testing showed no significant main or interaction effects of condition and

Discussion
Study 1 examined the effect of erotic (vs. control) priming on the PSE. We expected
sexual imagery in the PSE to increase from the baseline to the priming phase in the erotic
prime group. In the control group, no difference in sexual imagery from the baseline to the
test phase was expected. In line with our hypothesis, sexual imagery increased from the
baseline to the priming phase in the erotic prime group although not in a statistically
significant manner. This may be due to the use of the untailored AP nSex score or the
selection of the PSE stimuli. Nevertheless, it provides us with a first hint that the PSE may be
sensitive to the experimental manipulation of sexual motivation via picture cues. As
expected, in the control group, sexual imagery did not increase from baseline to priming
phase.
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 27
mediates the relationship between the experimental manipulation and sexual imagery. In this
study we used the UMACL (Matthews et al., 1990) to assess subjective affect before and
after the experimental manipulation took place but failed to find evidence of a main effect of
condition or an interaction effect of condition and prime duration on energetic arousal, tense
arousal, or hedonic tone. However, our measure assessed global affective states and thus did
not allow us to assess affective responses specifically to the stimuli employed during the
priming procedure. Therefore, it may have been too insensitive to pick up any cumulative
effects of the priming procedure after participants had completed the PSE and started on the
post-manipulation affect measure (by the time they finished the last picture story, 5 min had
elapsed after the last priming procedure). For these reasons, the UMACL does not appear to
be suitable as a mediator in our model.
To examine discriminant validity, we tested whether the motivational-arousal
manipulation was specific to nSex or whether it would also have an effect on nPow, nAff,
and nAch, three commonly studied motives. Results showed that there was no arousal effect
on these three motives. Additionally, we examined the overlap of dispositional nSex and the
three motives as well as the subscales of the BFI (John & Srivastava, 1999). Results
demonstrated that correlations were low, providing support for the discriminant validity of
our nSex arousal procedure.
Importantly, one must keep in mind that this study was the first attempt to assess nSex
with the PSE. This suggests that the a priori nSex score (consisting of all nSex subcagetories
excluding negative ones) may not have been ideal yet. In Study 2 we created new nSex scores
(based on the arousal manipulation and affective changes) in an attempt to arrive at an
optimized nSex coding system. This also allowed us to re-evaluate experimental-
manipulation effects on motivational imagery in Study 1.
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 28
Study 2
Study 2 is a replication and extension of Study 1. We used the same overall study
design as in the previous study but added a behavioral criterion measure. Moreover, this time
we assessed individuals’ affective responses to each specific priming stimulus via self-
assessment manikins for arousal and valence and psychophysiological measures (facial EMG
of corrugator and zygomatic activation and pupil size). This allowed us to test all pre-
registered hypotheses.
Method
Participants
Participants were 31 men and 82 women (N = 113) aged 18 to 36 years (M = 22.61,
SD = 3.71). Power analyses were based on power = .80 and an alpha level of .01, two-sided,
and suggested a sample size of n = 50 per group. Participants were randomly allocated to
erotic prime (n = 56) and control conditions (n = 57). 74 participants self-identified as
exclusively heterosexual, 31 participants as mostly heterosexual, five participants as bisexual
and three participants as mostly homosexual. Ethics approval was obtained from the
university board before recruitment began. Recruitment of participants took place through
social media and postings in the university setting of the Friedrich-Alexander University
Erlangen-Nuremberg. Inclusion criteria were the same as in Study 1 and participants received
20 Euro for their participation.
Design
The study had the same design as Study 1. Dependent variables were sexual imagery
in the PSE, relative viewing time and key presses for erotic (versus neutral) stimuli on the
key-press task, and affective responses to erotic versus neutral priming stimuli as assessed via
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 29
subjective ratings of arousal and valence and psychophysiological assessment of corrugator
and zygomatic activation as well as pupil size.
Materials and Measures
Stimuli
PSE pictures. As in Study 1, eight PSE pictures, divided into two sets, were chosen
whose selection followed the principles outlined in Study 1. All pictures were used here for
the first time and taken from newsmagazines and internet sources. Set A consists of the
following pictures: scantily clad couple, showing a man in underpants with a woman in front
of him wearing only a shirt; flirt, showing a woman biting her finger and sitting in front of a
man; massage, showing a woman lying prone and a man massaging her back; and tango
dancers, showing a man and woman who are on the dancefloor and surrounded by people.
Set B contains the following pictures: (un)dressing, showing a man standing behind a woman
and touching the zipper of her dress; couple in bathroom, showing a man and woman
standing in front of each other in a bathroom and brushing teeth; woman in charge, showing a
woman sitting on a couch in underwear and looking at a man standing in front of her; and
billiards, showing a woman playing billiards and a man leaning over her. Within these sets,
pictures were presented in randomized order for each participant. Upon request, the PSE
pictures can be shared.
Prime pictures. The same prime pictures were used as in Study 1.
Experimental manipulation
nSex content coding. As in Study 1, three independent coders content coded all PSE
stories for nSex according to the coding system. Subcategory reliabilities were, with very few
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 30
Content coding of other motives. As in Study 1, all PSE stories were additionally
coded by two trained coders who had previously reached at least 85% agreement with an
expert coder on calibration stories for imagery of achievement, power, and affiliation
motivation using Winter’s (1994) Manual for scoring motive imagery in running text.
Interrater reliabilities were .72 for achievement, .83 for power, and .87 for affiliation.
Key-press task (KPT)
Participants were informed that the overall task duration was fixed at 4 min,
regardless of their actions, but that they could control the viewing time of each individual
picture by pressing keys to increase or decrease it. Erotic and control stimuli were presented
in alternating order for a default time of 4 s each. 48 sexually arousing stimuli were selected
from a previously validated Portuguese database of sex pictures (EROSimag/UP-UA.pt;
Carvalho et al., 2014) and 48 generally arousing non-sexual stimuli were chosen from the
IAPS (Bradley & Lang, 2007). By using the up or down button on the keyboard, participants
could decide if they wanted to prolong stimulus presentation up to 8 s maximum or if they
wanted to shorten it to a minimum of 1 s. Although the latter value could be realized in
principle if pressing of the down button started within the first second of presentation, a
realistic lower-bound minimum was about 2 s. If participants did not use the keyboard
buttons at all, a new stimulus would be presented after 4 s had elapsed. This allowed us to
assess participants’ “wanting” of sexual incentives specifically by measuring the average
time they watched sexual pictures and invested keypress effort into this exposure, relative to
their efforts to change exposure durations of neutral pictures. Note that how much effort a
participant invested into increasing or decreasing viewing time for sexual stimuli on average
did not predetermine how much effort she or he invested into increasing or decreasing
viewing time for non-sexual stimuli; both effort parameters could thus vary independently.
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 31
From KPT data we derived measures of average viewing time in ms and average directional
(up versus down) key press frequency, separately for sexual and non-sexual pictures.
Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM)
The SAM (Bradley & Lang, 1994) is a picture-based measure that assesses valence
and arousal associated with persons’ affective responses on 5-point scales. The valence scale
shows a manikin smiling on the right and a manikin making a sad face on the left end of the
scale, with 3 intermediate expressions including a neutral midpoint in between. The arousal
scale shows a strongly excited manikin on the right and sleeping mannikin on the left end of
the scale, with 3 intermediate gradations in between. In this study, participants were asked to
rate the erotic and control prime stimuli on the SAM valence and arousal scales by clicking
on the manikin version that best expressed how they felt about the stimulus. Cronbach’s
alpha for arousal ratings in response to neutral stimuli was .93 and in response to erotic
stimuli .91. Cronbach’s alpha for valence ratings in response to neutral stimuli of valence was
.71 and in response to erotic stimuli 87. For statistical analyses, we used mean item scores for
each subscale.
Pupillometry
Pupil diameter (mm) was recorded using a Tobii TX300 eye tracker, at a sampling
rate of 300 Hz. Pupil size was recorded when erotic and control prime stimuli (adjusted for
equal luminance using Adobe Photoshop) were presented successively for 3 s each before
participants were asked to rate them on the SAM. Because only two of the four testing
cubicles were equipped with an eye tracker, pupil size could only be assessed in 54
participants.
Facial responses
Facial affective responses were assessed with EMG recorded from the skin over the
corrugator and zygomaticus muscles during the 3 s when participants viewed a stimulus and
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 32
before they rated it on the SAM scales. The skin was cleaned with alcohol and rubbed with a
conductive EMG-gel (Nuprep), keeping impedances below 10 k. The electrodes were filled
with electrode paste (OneStep Cleangel) and then attached to the left side of the face, over the
zygomaticus major and the corrugator supercilia muscle regions (Fridlund & Cacioppo,
1986). Ground was placed on the upper half of the forehead. Raw EMG signals were
recorded with a MP150 BIOPAC system at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. Using
AcqKnowledge 5.0, raw EMG data were filtered at a band pass of 28 to 500 Hz plus a notch
filter at 50 Hz, followed by signal rectification. Focus areas were created for the 3 s when
stimuli were presented and epoch analysis with epoch bin width of 200 ms was applied.
FCT
FCT assessment was identical to Study 1. When two stimuli of the same category
were presented for 30 ms, participants responded on average 70.63% (SD = 16.01) correctly,
and when two stimuli of different categories were shown, participants responded on average
83.13% (SD = 17.22) correctly. When two stimuli of the same category were presented for
500 ms, participants responded on average 99.62% (SD = 1.18) correctly, and when two
stimuli of different categories were shown, participants responded on average 99.95% (SD =
0.41) correctly.
Questionnaires
Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10). The BFI-10 (Rammstedt & John, 2007) is a self-
report measure that includes 10 items to assess the Big Five traits with two items each.
Participants were instructed to rate how well statements described them using a 5-point Likert
scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree), with the introduction “I see myself as
someone who…” followed by trait-specific endings. In our study, Cronbach’s alpha for
extraversion was .77, for agreeableness was .40, for conscientiousness was .64, for
neuroticism was .60, and for openness to experiences was .53. For the statistical analyses, the
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 33
negatively coded items were recoded and the mean score of the items for each subscale was
used.
Sexual inhibition/ sexual excitation (SIS/SES) scales – short form (SF). The
SIS/SES – SF (Carpenter et al., 2011) is a self-report questionnaire with 14 items that are
answered on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 “strongly disagree” to 4 “strongly agree”.
It includes three factors: the SES factor involves six items and refers to how different
intrapersonal (e.g., fantasies) and interpersonal (e.g., sexual partners) stimuli may enhance
sexual arousal (e.g., “When a sexually attractive stranger accidentally touches me, I easily
become aroused”); the SIS1 factor includes four items that depict how worries or concerns
about sexual functioning may reduce or inhibit sexual arousal (e.g. “I cannot get aroused
unless I focus exclusively on sexual stimulation”); and the SIS2 factor consists of four items
and refers to sexual inhibition related to potential negative consequences of sexual
interactions (e.g. “If I can be seen by others while having sex, I am unlikely to stay sexually
aroused”). In our study, Cronbach’s alpha for SES was .71, for SIS1 was .32, and for SIS2
was .65. For statistical analyses, we used the sum of the items for each subscale.
Revised Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI-R). The SOI-R (Penke &
Asendorpf, 2008) is a 9-item self-report measure that assesses sociosexual behavior, attitudes,
and desire. The behavior facet includes questions related to the number of sexual partners.
The attitude facet involves statements about the engagement in sexual relationships without
deeper emotional commitment. The desire facet includes questions related to the frequency of
sexual fantasies and arousal with persons where there is no deeper emotional commitment.
Participants are asked to answer the items on a 9-point Likert scale (ranging from 1 = “0” to 9
= “20 or more” for the behavior facet, 1 = “strongly disagree” to 9 = “strongly agree” for the
attitude facet, and 1 = “never” to 9 = “at least once a day” for the desire facet). In our study,
Cronbach’s alpha for the behavior facet was .83, for attitude fact was .74, and for desire facet
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 34
was .83. For statistical analyses, we recoded the negatively coded attitude item and used
mean the score for each subscale.
Procedure
Data collection took place from November to December 2018. Participants were
assessed individually at the HuMAN laboratory. Upon arrival, participants provided written
consent for participation in the study and were then seated for all following testing at separate
cubicles, each equipped with a Windows PC, a 60 Hz LCD screen with 24-inch diameter, a
keyboard, and a mouse. First, participants collected a saliva sample for later hormone
assaying (not part of this paper). Next, participants worked on the PSE. In the second half of
the PSE (priming phase) all experimental between-subjects factors were implemented.
Subsequently participants performed the KPT. Participants were then asked to collect the
second saliva sample and to call the experimenter. The experimenter then attached the
electrodes for the facial EMG. The experimenter further informed participants that their
pupils will be assessed using the eye-tracker and instructed them to move as little as possible.
When the experimenter left, participants continued with the SAM including the affect
measures. Then participants were asked to complete the approach-avoidance task (AAT) and
FCT in the version that corresponded to their experimental condition (sub- or supraliminal
primes, with prime stimuli either being erotic or neutral) followed by the questionnaires and
demographic information. Participants were debriefed and received their monetary
compensation.
Results
Selection of sensitive subcategories
In Study 1, the AP nSex score (i.e., the sum of all subcategories except for the
negative subcategories) was used for the statistical analyses. In Study 2, in addition to the AP
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 35
nSex score, we created optimized, data-driven nSex scores that are based on subcategories’
sensitivity to experimental manipulation (Study 1 and 2) and affective mediators (Study 2).
Particularly, we examined the change in coding count of each subcategory from the baseline
to the priming phase in the experimental group relative to the control group (see Appendix A
and B). Additionally, we investigated the direction and strength of the individual
subcategories with the affective mediators and the behavioral criterion (see Appendix B).
Based on these results, seven new nSex scores were created (see Appendix C). Particularly,
sum scores of the following subcategories were used:

H6. Mediation analyses were conducted in order to test whether changes in affect in
response to erotic vs. control stimuli (Hypotheses 2 to 5) mediate the predicted experimental-
the erotic vs. control stimuli were tested in a within-subjects design and nSex changes in a
between-subjects design, we deviated from typical mediation testing (i.e., because no
classical between-subjects a x b mediation path exists) by conducting individual simple linear
as mediators (although main effects of corrugator and zygomaticus activity were in the wrong
direction, mediation analyses are in the right direction). Therefore, we created two separate
vector variables for the erotic and control stimuli that consist of the three mediators. To do so,
we first subtracted the separate averaged responses to erotic and control stimuli for each
measure from the individual response and then divided the result by the standard deviation of
the averaged responses to erotic and control stimuli. Results confirm that there is a significant
combines all relevant affect mediators (i.e., we first z-standardized the three mediators and
then averaged them). Results suggest that mediation works for all nSex scores and is
especially strong for EM AND nSex.
Taken together, our results indicate the EM AND nSex score is specifically sensitive
to the experimental manipulation and to the affect mediation. For the following analyses, in
addition to the AP nSex score, we will use the EM AND nSex score as our optimized nSex
score, because it is the one score that is sensitive to both the experimental manipulation and
the affect mediation.

Discussion
Study 2 was a replication and extension of Study 1, guided by the same hypotheses
about the effects of motive arousal on story content changes, but with additional information
on the mediating role of affect for these effects and the mediating role of story content
changes on a behavioral criterion (relative viewing time for sexual stimuli, compared to
neutral stimuli). Supporting our central hypothesis, sexual imagery increased after priming
with erotic stimuli, but not after priming with neutral stimuli. This is in line with the notion
that the PSE is sensitive to the experimental manipulation of nSex. Unexpectedly, in the
control prime group, sexual imagery decreased from the baseline to the priming phase. We

suspect that control primes may have triggered other motives that suppressed sexual imagery
in the stories.
mediates the relationship between experimental manipulation and sexual imagery. First, the
effect of the experimental manipulation on the mediators was tested. In line with
expectations, participants reported more subjective arousal in response to erotic compared to
control stimuli. Participants also showed greater pupil dilation, a marker of emotional arousal
(Bradley et al., 2008), in response to erotic compared to control stimuli. In terms of emotional
valence, significant differences were found for corrugator and zygomaticus activity in
response to erotic vs. control stimuli, albeit not in the expected direction. Specifically, results
showed more corrugator activity when participants saw erotic compared to control stimuli,
and more zygomaticus activity when participants saw control compared to erotic stimuli. One
explanation for the effect of corrugator activity is that participants may have been surprised to
see erotic stimuli. Particularly, research showed that corrugator activity is indicative of
negative affect (e.g., Larsen et al., 2003), which was shown to be part of surprise responses
(Topolinski & Strack, 2015). This may also be the reason why zygomaticus activity was
absent in response to erotic stimuli.
However, and more importantly, to the extent that participants demonstrated less
corrugator and more zygomaticus activity and hence had a more positive affective response,
they also showed more sexual imagery in their PSE stories during the priming phase. This
suggests that although the main effect of corrugator and zygomaticus activity differs from the
predicted direction, the association with nSex and the mediation effect are in the predicted
direction. Regarding subjective valence, we observed no difference between erotic and
control stimuli.
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 52
After we ascertained that the mediators were sensitive to the experimental
manipulation (except for subjective valence), we tested them in the relationship between the
manipulation and the test. Specifically, new nSex scores were created based on their
sensitivity to the experimental manipulation and the mediators, which we then used to
examine the mediation. Results showed that corrugator, zygomaticus and subjective arousal
seem to be particularly suitable mediators. Findings also showed that pupil dilation may be a
suitable mediator because the mediation goes in the predicted direction. However, due to
small sample size the effect did not become statistically significant.
mediates the relationship between experimental manipulation and the behavioral criterion.
We did not find a direct effect of motivational arousal on relative viewing time for erotic
stimuli, which may be due to the subtle nature of the experimental manipulation (i.e.,
priming) and the time difference between the manipulation and the subsequent administration
of the KPT. But more importantly, we found that nSex predicts viewing time of erotic
pictures and that nSex is a mediator between the experimental condition and the KPT,
supporting our EMMIC validation model for nSex.
To investigate discriminant validity, we examined nPow, nAff, and nAch, three
commonly studied motives, in relation to nSex. First, we found that there was an arousal
effect on nSex but not on the other three motives. Second, results showed that there was no
substantial overlap between dispositional nSex and the other motives, except for a weak
positive correlation with nAff, providing support for the discriminant validity of our nSex
arousal procedure. Regarding convergent validity, we expected nSex to converge with the
global score and all subscales of the SOI-R as well as with the SES of the SIS/SES. Results
demonstrated that nSex converges specifically with the SES. Lastly, we tested the
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 53
incremental validity and results showed that the SES had an effect on the relative viewing
time of erotic stimuli over and above the sexual imagery.
General Discussion
Studies 1 and 2 were the first attempt to develop a picture-story measure of sexual
motivation that is not only causally valid in the sense of McClelland (1958) and Borsboom et
al. (2004), but also reflects motivation properly and predicts relevant outcomes. For this, we
that priming participants with erotic compared to control stimuli increases sexual imagery in
stories written in response to ambiguous pictures of social interactions. Second, in Study 2 we
showed that participants’ affective responses differed in response to erotic and control stimuli
and that some affective measures (i.e., corrugator, zygomaticus, subjective arousal) mediate
the relationship between experimental manipulation and changes in sexual imagery. Third,
we did not find that erotically primed individuals show longer relative viewing time for erotic
stimuli than control-prime individuals (i.e., our behavioral criterion). However, we did find
that nSex predicts increased viewing time for erotic stimuli and that it mediates the effect of
experimental condition on relative viewing time for erotic stimuli. Fourth, we found evidence
for the discriminant and convergent validity of the nSex arousal procedure.
Ultimately, the main goal of the two studies was to develop a coding system for nSex.
Only after inspection of each category for (a) sufficient inter-coder reliability and (b)
sensitivity for motivational-arousal effects, combined with predicted associations with affect
and criterion measures, we decided which categories are suitable for a preliminary nSex
coding system (Boyatzis, 1998). The present research was a first step in this direction.
Across two studies, we found that priming individuals with erotic compared to
control stimuli resulted in greater sexual imagery in the PSE. The effect size in Study 1 was
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 54
smaller than in Study 2 for all nSex scores which may be due to the different PSE stimuli
used in both studies. Specifically, the PSE pictures in Study 2 may have a stronger potential
to “pull” for nSex (Schultheiss & Pang, 2007) compared to those in Study 1.
Additionally, the effect sizes of the newly created nSex scores were all greater than
our a priori nSex scores in both studies. Specifically, the EM AND score appeared to deliver
the best results in the sense that it yielded significant effects of experimental motivational
arousal across both studies (which the AP score did not) and performed well in all other
analyses in Study 2. However, it needs to be noted that this is only a provisional optimized
nSex score as replication studies are necessary to find out which subcategories are suitable
across samples in order to arrive at a final nSex coding system.
Limitations
There are some limitations that are worth to be mentioned. Specifically, results
regarding subjective affect in both studies were not well-aligned, a finding that is likely to be
due to the unspecific and therefore unsuitable measure used in Study 1. The stimulus-specific
measure in Study 2 yielded more meaningful results.
In search of suitable mediators for the effect of the experimental manipulation on
changes in nSex we found that results of pupillometry went in the right direction; however,
the sample size of participants with eye-tracking data may have been too small to pick up a
statistically significant effect.
Lastly, the PSE appears to be a suitable tool to measure sexual motivation in a
causally valid manner. However, trained coders are necessary to code the PSE stories for
nSex. For this, researchers may reach out to experienced coders, or learn how to content-code
themselves. We will make all material necessary to learn how to code PSE stories for nSex
open to the public.
Future research
SEXUAL MOTIVATION: PRIMING 55
In the current studies, we presented a new approach to validate the measurement of
motive based on incentive motivation concepts and extending the previously introduced
notion that a valid measure needs to reflect variations in the attribute it targets. Specifically,
we used priming procedures as a motivational-arousal manipulation and showed these to be
effective in changing sexual themes in the PSE. To replicate these findings, future studies
should apply different experimental manipulations (e.g., audio stories, movies). These
methods may show even stronger effects (e.g., Both et al., 2004).
Although readers may wish for such a kind of closure, we refrain from deciding on
a final nSex coding system based on the present two studies. We fear that we would fall prey
to specific effects immanent in the methodological approach we used in the present research.
Instead, we refer readers to additional experimental studies using other arousal techniques
and the papers resulting from them that will help to select sensitive categories for the final
nSex coding system. Because a coding system can depend substantially on PSE stimuli,
statistical analyses should also focus on which PSE pictures are most suitable to measure
sexual motivation.
Looking beyond these more immediate steps, we think that it will be important be to
apply the nSex PSE in longitudinal studies. Specifically, in the current experimental studies
that were conducted in the laboratory we used the KPT as the behavioral criterion. In
everyday life, key criteria of nSex would be frequency of sexual activity and orgasm. And
surely it should be tested if nSex predicts these much more fundamental behaviors.
