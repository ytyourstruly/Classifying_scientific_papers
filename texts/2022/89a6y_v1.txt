Abstract
27 Background
28 Effectively managing their athletic and academic projects is a major challenge for student-
29 athletes. The salience of the identity they develop in each of these contexts can affect their well-
30 being and is therefore an important variable to consider. Examining these mechanisms in
31 countries and student-athlete support systems other than the United States is also important.
32 Aim
33 This study aims to both translate and evaluate the psychometric properties of a French version
34 of the Academic and Athletic Identity Scale, the AAIS-FR, and to examine the additive and
35 interactive relationships of the two identities with sport burnout and engagement.
36 Methods
37 Participants were 359 French student-athletes (50.42% female) who were competing at various
38 levels (ranging from regional to international).
39 Results
40 Results from analyses using a slightly modified version of the original scale provided evidence
41 of construct (i.e., factor structure) and concurrent (i.e., expected relationships between both
42 identities and several correlates identified in previous work) validity, as well as reliability (i.e.,
43 internal consistency) and invariance across gender and sport competition levels of the AAIS-
44 FR. In addition, regression analyses revealed a favourable relationship between athletic identity
45 and sport well-being (i.e., positive with engagement and negative with burnout), no relationship
46 between academic identity and sport well-being, and no interaction between the two identities.
47 Conclusion
48 While further research is needed to provide additional evidence for the validity of the AAIS-
49 FR, researchers can still use this tool to measure the salience of the two identities of French-
50 speaking student-athletes.
Introduction
52 Student-athletes (SAs) are expected to excel in both the athletic and academic contexts
53 (1). Previous research has highlighted that SAs were at increased risk for impaired well-being
54 due to the demands of both contexts (2). However, other work has not reported such a decrease
55 in SA well-being and has even highlighted the positive effects of combining these dual
56 commitments (1,3). The impact of dual projects on well-being appears to be related to how SAs
57 identify with each context (e.g., 4,5). Therefore, research that examines SAs’ dual identities is
58 needed to promote their well-being. To this end, Yukhymenko-Lescroart (2014) developed and
59 validated the Athletic and Academic Identity Scale (AAIS) (6). Due to its promising
60 psychometric properties, widespread use in English-speaking countries, and availability in
61 different languages versions, some authors have recently proposed the AAIS as a potential gold
62 standard in dual career research. They have encouraged future research to examine its cross-
63 cultural psychometric validity (7). The same authors also called for studies to be conducted in
64 contexts other than the North American university campus to explore the impact of structural
65 differences on the development of SAs’ identity and well-being. The purpose of this study is
66 precisely to propose a French version of the AAIS and to examine its construct and concurrent
67 validity, as well as its relationship with sport well-being (i.e., athlete engagement and burnout)
68 among French SAs.
Student-athlete identity
70 Identity is a fundamental psychological process that results in a subjective interpretation of
71 who we are based on our socio-demographic features, personal characteristics, commitment,
72 and group membership (Brewer et al., 1993; Caza et al., 2018). According to Erikson (1968),
73 an individual's identity is multidimensional in the sense that it is made up of a mosaic of specific
74 identities built around the key social roles an individual plays (e.g., athlete, student, worker,
75 child). Each of these identities may be more or less salient to individuals, depending on the
76 importance they attach to some over others. This identity salience is related to individuals’
77 levels of commitment to their various roles (11), which may fluctuate over time (12,13). In
78 addition, identity salience provides a cognitive framework that guides and organizes
79 information processing and determines how individuals should feel or behave in a given
80 situation (11).
81 Many elite athletes are involved in both competitive sport and higher education. Consistent
82 with work on identity development, they should develop both academic and athletic identities
83 that align with their two primary roles (5,7). Conceptually, “academic identity can be defined
84 as the centrality of being a student to the sense of self. Likewise, athletic identity can refer to
85 the centrality of being an athlete to the sense of self” (14) (p.3). While SAs may develop both
86 identities, it is also possible that one may be more salient for some (6). For example, the athletic
87 identity may be highly salient for some SAs and block the development of their academic
88 identity, a phenomenon known as identity foreclosure (15).
89 Ultimately, understanding how dual projects affect SAs' well-being requires assessing how
90 they identify with each of the two contexts (i.e., athletic and academic). In other words, it is
91 necessary to carefully examine multidimensional identities, not just one or the other (5,7). The
92 studies that have done so are relatively few in number (7) and have used different instruments
93 with more or less satisfactory psychometric qualities (see for a review 6,7), making it difficult
94 to compare and generalize the results across studies. The AAIS (6) is an 11-item scale
95 specifically designed to measure both academic and athletic identities in a brief and specific
96 format. Respondents are asked to what extent each of the presented characteristics (e.g., being
97 athletic) is central to their sense of self. They use a response scale consisting of several
98 concentric circles representing different degrees of centrality of self-identification, from the
99 value 6, the central circle anchored by “very central core to who I really am” to the value 1
100 falling outside the larger circle anchored by “not central to who I really am”. In two studies
101 conducted with a sample of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) SAs,
102 Yukhymenko-Lescroart (2014) provided evidence for the content and factorial validity of the
103 AAIS, as well as its reliability and invariance across gender and sport competition level (6).
104 Since its development, the AAIS has been widely used in English-speaking countries such as
105 the United States (14,16,17), United Kingdom (18) and Australia (5). More recently, the
106 instrument has been translated and validated with Japanese (19,20) and Brazilian (21)
107 participants. Given this extensive use and promising psychometric properties, a recent
108 systematic literature review recommended examining the cross-cultural psychometric validity
109 of the AAIS (7). To validate the AAIS in another language, it is necessary to know the correlates
110 of academic and athletic identities.
Correlates of academic and athletic identities
112 Numerous correlates of athletic or academic identity have been documented (i.e., variables
113 that may have reciprocal causality with identity), with associations whose effect sizes are
114 generally small to moderate (22). For example, several studies have confirmed Brewer et al.’s
115 (1993) hypothesis (8) that athletes competing at elite and advanced levels should endorse a
116 higher athletic identity than those competing at lower levels 5,6,20); for reviews see: 7,22).
117 Reaching international or Olympic levels requires a greater commitment of time, energy and
118 resources than reaching lower levels. Athletes at the international or Olympic level also tend to
119 receive more social support and recognition than those at lower levels. Greater commitment
120 and social support probably explain why athletes who reach the highest levels of performance
121 have a stronger identification with athletic role than those at lower levels. In turn, this greater
122 commitment and better athletic outcomes, as well as a higher value placed on the athletic
123 experience, generally lead athletes with a strong athletic identity to experience greater
124 satisfaction with their athletic outcomes than those with a lower athletic identity (23).
125 Furthermore, based on the assumption that sport conforms more to male than to female gender
126 norms and roles (24), several studies have reported that male athletes adopt a more athletic
127 identity than female athletes (25,26). However, the findings have not always been consistent
128 (6), and recent work has reported no differences in athletic identity between males and females
129 (13,27), perhaps reflecting the evolution of gender stereotypes and societal expectations
130 regarding women's place in sport (28).
131 Previous literature has also shown that academic identity is related to various variables such
132 as gender, academic investment, achievement, and satisfaction (see for a review: 29). For
133 example, studies report that girls have a more salient academic identity than boys (13,26,27).
134 However, this difference does not appear in all studies (5,6). In addition, students who identify
135 strongly with their role as a student put more effort into their studies (16), have higher academic
136 commitment (30), and get higher grades (13,17,19,27,31) than those who identify weakly.
Student-athlete identity and sport well-being
138 Well-being is more than the absence of mental illness (32). It is a state that allows for
139 optimal functioning in the global life or in a specific context, which makes it possible to study
140 it at a global and contextual level (33). Research that has examined the relationship between
141 identity and well-being among SAs has been somewhat inconsistent, in part because of the
142 variety of well-being constructs that have been used and the levels of analysis (global or
143 contextual) at which they have been examined, making it difficult to compare results across
144 studies. A growing body of research suggests that the well-being of athletes is linked to the
145 meaningful contexts in which they develop (33). For many SAs, elite sport occupies a large part
146 of their lives. This context contains many demands and challenges that can make it a stress
147 factor or a source of satisfaction and fulfilment. Therefore, it seems important to examine SAs’
148 well-being specific to the sport context (4) using indicators that capture both adaptive and
149 maladaptive facets of the experience, such as athlete burnout and athlete engagement (34,35).
150 Athlete burnout is generally described as a negative psychological state characterized
151 by a combination of emotional and physical exhaustion, devaluation of sport, and reduced sense
152 of accomplishment (36). With a few exceptions (37), most studies have reported a negative
153 correlation between the salience of SAs’ athletic identity and burnout (38–40), suggesting that
154 endorsing such an identity could help prevent burnout. Because athletic identity is associated
155 with high motivation and energy for sports (8), athletes who are willing to train hard may be
156 more likely to endure psychological and physical discomfort (40). Additionally, athletes with a
157 strong athletic identity are more likely to possess high levels of mental toughness (40), a
158 psychological characteristic that may protect them from experiencing the symptoms of athlete
159 burnout (41).
160 While burnout represents a maladaptive cognitive-affective experience, its absence does
161 not necessarily indicate the presence of an adaptive experience. For this reason, some authors
162 recommend assessing both the positive and negative facets of the sport experience (34). Athlete
163 engagement is generally defined as a positive and relatively enduring cognitive-affective
164 experience in sport, characterized by confidence, dedication, vigor, and enthusiasm (35). We
165 found only one study that examined the relationship between athletic identity and this construct
166 (42). This study was conducted among elite Croatian sprinters and found positive correlations
167 between certain dimensions of engagement (dedication, enthusiasm) and athletic identity. Other
168 positive relationships were highlighted in the meta-analysis by Lochbaum et al. (2022) (22)
169 between athletic identity and constructs related to certain dimensions of engagement, such as
170 intrinsic motivation and commitment (constructs close to dedication), positive affect, emotions
171 and feelings (close to enthusiasm), self-esteem, worth, and competence (close to confidence).
172 Among SAs, four studies have shown that athletic identity is positively related to constructs
173 closely associated with sport engagement, such as enthusiastic commitment (19), achievement
174 (43) or autonomous (44) motivation, or intrinsic interest in and value of sport (16). In summary,
175 previous research has shown positive associations between athletic identity, on the one hand,
176 and a higher desire to invest time and effort in sport, self-confidence to achieve goals and
177 succeed in sport, and intrinsic motivation for sport, on the other hand; in short, characteristics
178 of higher engagement.
179 Not only have there been few studies examining the relationship between SA identities
180 and athletic well-being, but those that exist have used a diversity of approaches, making it
181 complicated to compare results. At least four different approaches have been employed:
182 isolated (between athletic identity or academic identity and well-being without regard to the
183 other identity; e.g., 38), globalized (between the overall “student-athlete” identity, rather than
184 each of the two identities measured separately; e.g., 45), additive (between both identities and
185 well-being, where each identity may be positively or negatively related to well-being; e.g., 40),
186 and interactive (where one identity may moderate the relationship between the other identity
187 and well-being; e.g., 4) approaches. The majority of studies have used the isolated approach,
188 focusing only on athletic identity. To the extent that SAs are involved in two primary roles, it
189 is critical to examine how identification with these two roles relates to sport well-being. It is
190 possible that a strong identification with the student role allows for the development of
191 resources and skills in this area that help to enhance sport well-being. It is also possible that a
192 strong identification with the student role creates role and identity conflicts that may hinder
193 sport well-being (27). To gain a deeper understanding of how the two identities coexist and
194 contribute together to the well-being of SAs, either additive or interactive approaches are
195 needed. To our knowledge, only one study has examined the relationship between the two
196 identities and athlete burnout using the additive method (40). While athletic identity was
197 negatively related to athlete burnout, as in the majority of previous studies, academic identity
198 was positively related to this variable. In other words, the stronger the SAs' academic identity,
199 the more sport burnout they reported, thus limiting the positive effects of athletic identity on
200 this variable. Finally, we found only one study that used the interactive method to predict sport
201 well-being (4), as indexed by the Sport Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (46). While
202 athletic identity predicted (negatively) sport well-being, neither academic identity nor the
203 interaction between the two identities was related to this variable. This result suggests that
204 academic identity did not moderate the relationship between athletic identity and sport well-
205 being. However, as this study took place during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic,
206 further research is needed to verify that this result is not specific to this study.
The present study
208 Based on the reviewed literature, the present study had two main objectives. The first
209 goal was to develop a French version of the AAIS (AAIS-FR), to test its construct validity (i.e.,
210 factor structure), reliability (i.e., internal consistency), invariance with gender and sport
211 competition level, as well as its concurrent validity by examining its relationships with gender,
212 level of competition, time spent in athletic and academic contexts, satisfaction with athletic and
213 academic results. The second goal was to examine the relationships between the two identities
214 and SAs sport well-being. As suggested by several authors (34,35), we measured burnout and
215 engagement which capture two complementary facets of sport well-being, a maladaptive and
216 an adaptive cognitive and affective experience, respectively.
217 Based on previous results, we expected that (a) the factor structure and reliability of the
218 AAIS-FR would be similar to the original scale, (b) the AAIS-FR would be invariant across
219 gender and sport competition level as the original scale, (c) athletic identity would be positively
220 related to time spent in sport, satisfaction with sport results, and higher levels of sport
221 competition, but not to gender, (d) academic identity would be positively related to time spent
222 on academics, satisfaction with academic results, and would be higher for women than for men,
223 (e) athletic identity would negatively predict athlete burnout and positively predict athlete
224 engagement. No hypotheses were formulated regarding relationships between time dedicated
225 or satisfaction with results in one context (e.g., academic) and identity in the other context (e.g.,
226 athletic) due to a lack of empirical data. For the same reasons, no hypotheses were formulated
227 regarding the relationship between academic identity and athlete burnout or engagement, or the
228 interaction between the two identities on sport well-being. However, the additive or interactive
229 effects of the two identities on sport well-being will be examined.

243 2020.
Measure.
Participants and contextual characteristics.
246 Questions about gender, academic (i.e., major, academic year, number of hours per week
247 spent on academic activities, satisfaction with academic results), and athletic (i.e., type of sport,
248 level of sport competition, number of hours per week spent on athletic activities, satisfaction
249 with athletic results) characteristics of SAs were used in the present study. Time spent on each
250 role was assessed by one item for each context (i.e., “How many hours per week do you spend
251 on your studies [sport]?”). Satisfaction with the results for each role was assessed by one item
252 for each context (i.e., “How satisfied would you say you are with the results of your studies
253 [sport]?”), with responses provided on a 7-point response format ranging from (1) not satisfied
254 at all to (7) very satisfied.
Academic and Athletic Identities.
256 A French translation of the 11-item AAIS was used. It consists of two subscales:
257 academic identity (five items, e.g., “Doing well in school.”) and athletic identity (six items, e.g.,
258 “Being a good athlete.”). Responses are given on a 6-point scale ranging from (1) not central
259 to my sense of self to (6) very central to my sense of self. The items are preceded by the sentence
260 “Please indicate how central each of the following characteristics is to your sense of who you
261 really are”. The French version of the questionnaire with the introductory part is provided in
262 Supplementary Material. We followed the guidelines for the process of cross-cultural
263 adaptation of self-report measures (47). Specifically, the original version of the AAIS was
264 independently translated from English into French by three French sport psychology
265 researchers fluent in English. They compared and discussed the translations and agreed on a
266 preliminary French version that retained the basic features of the original questionnaire. Then,
267 during a back-translation stage, the French version was translated into English by a professional
268 English translator who had not been involved in the first translation phase. The two English
269 versions were then compared for inconsistencies. Discussions were held between the
270 researchers and the translator to reach a consensus where there were differences between the
271 two versions.
Sport Engagement.
273 A French version of the 16-item Athlete Engagement Questionnaire (AEQ) was used to
274 assess the positive side of well-being (35). The scale consists of four subscales: confidence
275 (four items, e.g., “I feel capable of success in my sport”), dedication (four items, e.g., “I am
276 devoted to my sport”), vigour (four items, e.g., “I feel energized when I participate in my
277 sport”), and enthusiasm (four items, e.g., “I feel excited about my sport”). Responses are given
278 on a five-point scale, from (1) almost never to (5) almost always. Adequate factor structure of
279 the scale:  (363) = 359.916, df = 98, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.93, SRMR = 0.065, and reliability (
280 ranging from 0.85 to 0.90 for the subscales and equal to 0.97 for the total scale) were
281 demonstrated in this study.
Sport Burnout.
283 The Athlete Burnout Scale (ABO-S), a French 14 items scale measuring athlete burnout
284 (48), was used to assess the negative side of well-being. It consists of three subscales: reduced
285 sense of accomplishment (four items, e.g., “I am not performing up to my abilities”), physical
286 exhaustion (five items, e.g., “I feel physically exhausted”), and negative feelings (five items,
287 e.g., “I have negative feelings toward my sport”). Reponses are given on a five-point scale, from
288 (1) almost never to (5) almost always. Adequate factor structure of the scale:  (74, N = 359)
289 = 282.916, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.90, SRMR = 0.069, and reliability ( ranging from 0.77 to 0.90
290 for the subscales and equal to 0.93 for the total scale) were demonstrated in this study.
Data analysis.
292 All analyses were performed using the R software (49) with the following packages:
293 “psych” (50), “lavaan” (51), “corx” (52), “interactions” (53). First, the factorial structure was
294 examined using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to test whether the 11 items of the AAIS-
295 FR grouped well on two latent variables, without the possibility of cross-loading. The fit of the
296 tested model was assessed by several goodness-of-fit indices (54), including chi-square ( ),
297 Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and Standardized Root Mean Square (SRMR). CFI values close
298 to .90 and .95 indicate adequate and excellent model fit, respectively, while SRMR values close
299 to .08 and .05 indicate adequate and excellent model fit, respectively (54). Second, the
300 reliability of the subscales was estimated using McDonald’s omega coefficient (, 55).
301 Next, a series of nested CFA models were estimated to examine measurement invariance
302 by gender and level of sport competition. Specifically, we systematically assessed configural
303 (i.e., whether the factor structure of the AAIS-FR differed by gender or level of sport
304 competition), metric (i.e., whether factor loadings differed across groups), and scalar (i.e.,
305 whether intercepts differed across groups) invariance in a series of increasingly constrained
306 nested models (56). Model fit of the initial configural model was assessed using CFI and
307 SRMR. Measurement invariance was estimated from changes in the goodness-of-fit indices.
308 Measurement invariance between models is indicated when CFI and SRMR of the later
309 model compared to the previous model are ≤ 0.010 and ≤ 0.015, respectively (57).
310 After confirming the validity, reliability, and invariance of the AAIS-FR, analyses of
311 variance (ANOVAs) and bivariate correlations were used to examine the concurrent validity
312 using relationships between the two identities, gender, level of sport competition, time spent in
313 academic and athletic contexts, satisfaction with academic and athletic results. Finally, two
314 separate hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to test whether the two
315 identities and their interaction predicted athlete engagement and burnout after controlling for
316 relevant variables correlated with SAs’ well-being. Specifically, in a first step, we entered the
317 control variables; then in a second step, we added the two identities to test whether athletic
318 identity was a predictor of sport well-being; and finally, in a third step, we added the interaction
319 term between the two identities to test whether academic identity was a moderator of the
320 relationship between athletic identity and sport well-being.
Results
Descriptive statistics.
323 The normality of the data was screened for ABO-S, AEQ and AAIS-FR. The results
324 showed that the majority of skewness values were comprised between -1 and 1 and kurtosis
325 values were comprised between -2 and 2. Only four exceptions with large deviations (greater
326 than 0.5 for skewness or greater than 1.0 for kurtosis) were found: one in the AAIS-FR (item 4
327 of the athletic identity subscale), one in the ABO-S (item 4 of sport devaluation), and two in
328 the AEQ (items 3 and 4 of enthusiasm). Since most of the items can be considered normal, we
329 used maximum likelihood estimation in the CFAs (Carlsberg et al., 2016).
CFA and reliability.
331 The 11-item AAIS-FR two-factor model showed a sub-optimal model fit to the data, 
332 (43, N = 359) = 310, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.89, SRMR = 0.06. Examination of standardized factor
333 loadings and omega coefficients indicated that item ATI4 had a low factor loading (λ = 0.38)
334 and that removal from the scale improved the omega coefficient (from 0.87 to 0.89). A second
335 CFA was performed with 10 items and showed an improvement in the fits,  (34, N = 359) =
336 259, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.91, SRMR = 0.053. Nevertheless, the modification indices (MI) showed
337 the existence of a large residual between a pair of items of the same subscale (i.e., mi =
ATI5-ATI6
338 114.380). Therefore, a third model was run that specified a correlation between the errors of
339 these two items. This model fit the data much better,  (33, N = 359) = 130, p < 0.001, CFI =
340 0.96, SRMR = 0.04. The factor loadings of this model ranged from 0.76 to 0.85 for academic
342 positively correlated ( = 0.29). The omega coefficients were 0.90 and 0.89 for academic and
343 athletic identity, respectively, indicating adequate reliability.

Measurement invariance.
Gender invariance.
351 AAIS-FR factor model was the same for both male and female SAs. When the metric invariance
352 model was compared to the configural invariance model, the changes of CFI and SRMR were
353 within the recommended cut-off, indicating that the metric invariance between genders was
354 met. When the scalar invariance model was compared with the metric invariance model, the
355 CFI and SRMR were within the recommended cut-off, meaning that the scalar invariance
356 between genders was met. These results demonstrated the measurement invariance of the
357 AAIS-FR across gender, suggesting that the scale can be used for both genders.

361 Configural invariance was demonstrated by on the fit indices, which indicated that the

364 and SRMR were within the recommended cut-off, indicating that both metric and scalar

Concurrent validity of the AAIS-FR.
368 The means, standard deviations, and correlations of the study variables are displayed in
370 found between academic identity and satisfaction with academic results (r = 0.46, p < 0.001)
371 and time spent on academics (r = 0.17, p < 0.010). In addition, it was not related to the same
372 variables assessed in the athletic context (all r  0.05). Athletic identity was significantly
373 correlated with satisfaction with the athletic results (r = 0.27, p < 0.001) and time spent on sport
374 (r = 0.27, p < 0.001). It was also negatively correlated with time spent on academics (r = -0.16,
375 p < 0.010), but not with satisfaction with academic results (r = -0.02).

379 Two two-way ANOVAs were conducted to examine whether differences in SAs’
380 academic and athletic identities could be explained by gender, sport competition level, or the
381 interaction of gender and sport competition level. Regarding academic identity, a significant
382 main effect for gender emerged, F(1, 353) = 5.22, p < 0.050, with small effect size ( = 0.015);
383 females (M = 4.08, SD = 1.07) reported higher scores than males (M = 3.83, SD = 1.08). No
384 significant effects were found for level of sport competition, and the two-way interaction (all F
385 < 1.35, p > .260,   0.008). Regarding athletic identity, a significant main effect for level of
386 sport competition emerged, F(2, 353) = 15.78, p < 0.001, with a medium effect size ( =
387 0.082). Post-hoc Tukey tests revealed that SAs competing at the regional level reported lower
388 athletic identity (M = 4.63, SD = 1.01) compared to those competing at the national (M = 5.09,
389 SD = 0.72) or international (M = 5.31, SD = 0.75) level (all t > 4.02, p <0.001, with medium
390 and large effect sizes, d = 0.52 and 0.80, respectively). However, SAs in these last two groups
391 showed only small differences (p = 0.084, d = 0.27). No significant effect was found for gender
392 and the two-way interaction (all F < 1.79, p >.18,   0.005).
Student-athletes’ identities and sport well-being.
395 indicated that two demographic variables (i.e., gender and level of sport competition) were
396 related to SA’ well-being. Therefore, they were entered into the first stage of hierarchical
398 5). Adding the two identities significantly increased the explained variance of engagement, F(4,
2 2 2
399 346) = 18.60, p <0.001, R = 0.18, R = 0.13, and burnout, F(4, 346) = 6.62, p <0.001, R =
400 0.07, R = 0.05. In both analyses, only gender (i.e., males reported higher well-being than
401 females) and athletic identity significantly predicted SA’ well-being ( = 0.38 and -0.23 for
402 engagement and burnout, respectively). The addition of the interaction term between the two
403 identities in Step 3 did not improve the explained variance (All F < 1.94, p > 0.160, R <
404 0.01), meaning that academic identity did not have a moderating effect on the relationship
405 between athletic identity and SAs well-being. Additional analyses were conducted using the
406 AEQ and ABO-S subscales. They revealed the same pattern of results as the overall engagement
407 and burnout scores, namely a positive relationship of athletic identity on the four engagement
408 subscales (ranging from 0.20 to 0.37) and a negative relationship of athletic identity on the three
409 burnout subscales (ranging from -0.14 to -0.27)

Discussion
SAs must be effective in managing both athletic and academic careers. A critical
variable in their adaptation, performance, and well-being is the salience of the identity they
develop in each of these two contexts (7). Having reliable and valid instruments to assess the
academic and athletic identities of SAs is therefore crucial. Based on its promising
psychometric properties, as demonstrated in several international studies (5,18,19,21), the
AAIS (6) is the only instrument recommended in a recent literature review as having the
potential to become a gold standard for dual career research (7). In addition, it is important to
validate the scale with SAs from different cultures and countries in order to examine the
antecedents and consequences of dual identity in different SAs support structures (7).
Therefore, the aims of this study were both to develop a reliable and valid French version of
the AAIS to enable studies on this topic with French-speaking participants, and to examine the
additive and interactive relationships of the two identities with sport burnout and engagement
among French SAs.
Preliminary evidence of the AAIS-FR validity and reliability.
Overall, the validity and reliability of the AAIS-FR were fairly well supported by four
sources of evidence. First, CFAs confirmed the positively correlated two-factor structure of the
AAIS-FR as in the original instrument. However, in contrast to this later, our results showed
that one item (ATI4, “Being proud to be an athlete.”) made a relatively small contribution to
the athletic identity factor, and deleting it improved the fit indices and reliability. This item is
the only one that refers to an athletic pride, a strong emotion related to self-worth that may
depend on the performance achieved and the involvement in the athlete role (58). In other
words, some French SAs in our study may have reported a low score on this item not because
they had a weak athletic identity, but because they were not performing particularly well at the
moment, or were not able to fully engage in their role as an athlete. It's also possible that this
adjective has a slightly different meaning in French than in English or other languages into
which the AAIS has been translated. Deleting this item does not seem to be an important issue,
since it has no equivalent in the academic identity subscale. In addition, the modification indices
suggested to add a correlation between the errors of two items on the athletic identity subscale,
meaning that these items shared something specificities that the other items on the subscale did
not: (ATI5, “Being satisfied with my athletic achievements.”) and (ATI6, “Doing well during
sport competitions.”). Indeed, it is possible that the response to item ATI5 is perceived as being
closely dependent on the response to item ATI6. It should be noted that the same pattern was
observed in the Brazilian version of the AAIS (21). Further studies are needed to determine
whether this is a culture-specific finding and whether these items need to be modified in the
future.
Second, measurement invariance tests were conducted to examine the factorial validity
of the AAIS-FR as a function of gender and level of sport competition (i.e., regional, national,
and international). Consistent with our hypothesis and previous works (6), our results confirmed
the configural, metric, and scalar invariance of the instrument across gender and sport
competition level, suggesting that the AAIS-FR can be used to reliably measure the academic
and athletic identities of French male and female SAs, regardless of their level of sport
competition. Third, as in other studies (6,19,21), the two subscales of the AAIS-FR showed
acceptable reliability, as indexed by McDonalds’ omega coefficients  .89, confirming adequate
internal consistency.
Fourth, evidence for the concurrent validity of the AAIS-FR was provided by
highlighting expected relationships between academic and athletic identities and several
correlates identified in previous work. Consistent with our hypothesis and most previous work
(e.g., 5,6,20), our results showed that SAs competing at the elite and advanced levels (i.e.,
national and international) had higher athletic identity than those competing at the lowest level
(i.e., regional). While the differences between the top two levels and the lowest level were of
medium and large effect size, the athletic identity of international level SAs was only slightly
higher than that of national level athletes. Thus, there appears to be a ceiling effect at the
national level, while it is likely that the investments and demands associated with the
international and Olympic levels are greater than those at the national level. In the same vein,
correlational analyses showed that athletic identity was positively correlated with time spent in
sport and satisfaction with athletic results, as in previous studies (e.g., 6,16,23). This means that
the higher the athletic identity, the more time and energy SAs are likely to invest in the sport
context. This greater investment, in turn, maximizes the chances of good results and greater
satisfaction.
In line with our hypothesis, we found no gender differences in athletic identity. As we
have just seen, only the level of competition (and the associated level of investment) was related
to this variable. While older studies have reported a higher athletic identity in males than in
females (e.g., 25,26), more recent findings have shown no such difference (e.g., 6,13,27). This
is likely due to the evolution of gender stereotypes and societal expectations regarding women’s
place in sport, a field that is no longer perceived as conforming to masculine rather than
feminine gender roles (28).
As expected, SAs with a high academic identity spent more time on academics and were
more satisfied with their academic results. These findings are consistent with previous work
showing that SAs who strongly identify with their role as a student put forth more effort (16),
report greater commitment in academics (17), and get better grades (13,19,27) than others,
which may explain their greater satisfaction with academic results found in our study.
Confirming some of the literature (13,26,27), we found that academic identity was
higher among female than male SAs. However, this finding is not unique to SAs; several
previous works have shown the existence of gender differences in academics, with girls being
more engaged and generally performing slightly better than boys (59). Another explanation that
has been proposed concerns the fewer professional career opportunities available to women in
the sport context (60). In order to secure a professional future, it might be in their interest to
invest in the academic context and thus develop a stronger academic identity than men (7,26).
However, the effect size found in our study was small, and several studies have found no
differences (e.g., 6). Therefore, more research seems to be needed before we can come to a firm
conclusion on this issue. Interestingly, we found no differences in academic identity as a
function of sport competition level. Previous studies have found inconsistent results. Sometimes
SAs at the highest levels of competition had lower academic identity than those at lower levels
(6), but sometimes the opposite was true (20), likely reflecting the specificity of the SA support
system in each of these studies. The results of our study indicate that competing at the
international or Olympic level does not come at the expense of developing an academic identity,
which is rather good news.
Finally, a cross-domain relationship was found between athletic identity and time spent
studying, and more generally between time dedicated to academics and sport. Specifically, the
results showed that the higher the athletic identity (or the more time spent studying), the less
time SAs spent on their academics. This finding is consistent with some previous studies that
have shown that strong athletic identification can have detrimental effects on the academic
domain, whether in terms of effort (16) or grades (5,17). It is possible that some SAs with a
strong athletic identity experience conflict between the two domains, prioritizing (at least in
terms of time) the athletic context at the expense of the academic context. However, the effect
size of the correlation is small, and the relationship is significant only for time spent on
academics and not for satisfaction with academic performance. In addition, there was no
significant relationship between academic identity and time spent on sport or satisfaction with
academic results. Ultimately, we found little evidence for the existence of cross-domain
relationships; our results mainly confirm the hypothesized relationships between domain
identification (academic and/or athletic) and certain correlates within that domain (time spent
and satisfaction with results).
Student-athletes’ identities and Sport Well-being
Given the significant amount of time SAs devote to sport, it is important to know how
they feel about it (4), based on positive (e.g., engagement) and negative (e.g., burnout)
indicators of well-being (34,35). Our study is the first to systematically examine the additive
and interactive relationships of both identities with SAs sport well-being. The few previous
studies have primarily examined the effects of athletic identity. However, both dominant roles
of SAs are likely to affect their well-being and therefore should be systematically measured (5–
7). Taking both identities into account also makes it possible to determine whether one of them
is used in a privileged way depending on the context, and how they combine to predict well-
being (4).
In line with our hypothesis, the results indicated that athletic identity negatively
predicted burnout. The more SAs identified with their athletic role, the fewer burnout syndrome
they reported, and vice versa. This finding is consistent with most previous studies (e.g., 38–
40). A strong athletic identity could promote motivation to fully engage in sport (8) and mental
toughness (40), making it easier to cope with the physical and psychological discomfort
associated with the demands of elite sport (40). Nevertheless, the weight of the beta coefficient
is small, suggesting that athletic identity has limited impact in preventing burnout among SAs.
Further research is needed to identify the mechanisms by which athletic identity is related to
sport burnout and its moderators.
Academic identity was not significantly related to sport burnout. To our knowledge,
only one study has examined the relationship between the two identities and burnout (40). In
contrast to our findings, the study revealed that academic identity was a positive predictor of
burnout. The authors concluded that SAs with a strong academic identity are vulnerable to sport
burnout due to the demands of excelling in both academics and athletics. It is possible that the
SAs in this study were subjected to greater academic demands than those in our study, but it is
also possible that the result of the Martin et al. study is merely a statistical artefact (e.g., a
suppressive effect), as the correlation between academic identity and sport burnout was
negative rather than positive (r = -0.25, p > 0.050) and the two identities were highly correlated
(r = 0.71, p < 0.010) (40). The non-significant relationship we found in our study may mean
that for some SAs, having a strong academic identity may be something positive in preventing
burnout, and for others, it may be something negative. For example, it is possible that for the
former, a strong academic identity allows for the development of resources useful for sport
(e.g., concentration, planning, stress management), whereas for the latter, the desire to do well
academically may conflict with athletic commitment and thus be a source of burnout. Therefore,
future work is needed on the mechanisms that may link academic identity to sport burnout, and
to identify for who the relationship is positive or negative. In this regard, measuring perceptions
of conflict, enrichment or role separation may be a promising avenue (27,61).
On the other hand, the moderation analysis we conducted was not significant, meaning
that the negative relationship between athletic identity and burnout was identical regardless of
the level of academic identity. Given the paucity of previous work, we did not formulate a
specific hypothesis. Some authors have suggested that identity foreclosure (i.e., a strong athletic
identity combined with a weak academic identity) is a risk factor for sport burnout (62), but the
results of studies on this topic are rather inconsistent (15). Based on a holistic perspective, other
authors have suggested that the development of multiple identities (e.g., strong athletic and
academic identities) provides numerous benefits, especially in terms of SA well-being (e.g.,
61,63). While our findings did not confirm either of these perspectives, future studies that wish
to test them would do well to systematically use the additive and interactive approach we used
in this study.
A pattern of results very similar to burnout was found for engagement, namely a positive
relationship between athletic identity and engagement, but no significant effect of academic
identity or moderating effect. This finding suggests that the stronger the athletic identity, the
higher the engagement reported by SAs. Although we were unable to locate any previous
studies that have examined the relationship between SA identities and the specific construct of
engagement, this result is nonetheless consistent with our hypothesis and previous studies that
have measured constructs closer to certain dimensions of engagement, such as enthusiastic
commitment (19), achievement (43) or autonomous (44) motivation. Only in one study (4), a
negative relationship was found between athletic identity and a positive dimension of sport
well-being (i.e., the sport mental health continuum). This unexpected finding was explained by
the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which did not allow SAs to benefit from
the support and positive social interactions that typically result from sport activities and are
associated with well-being. Further studies are needed to examine the additive and interactive
relationships between the two SA identities and various indicators of athletic well-being.
Finally, it should be noted that the weight of the relationship between sport identity and
well-being was stronger for engagement than for burnout ( = 0.38 vs.  = -0.23, respectively)
and explained a greater proportion of the variance (17.70% vs. 7.10%, respectively), confirming
the view that burnout and engagement are not two opposite sides of the same coin and the
importance of using well-being indicators that capture both adaptive and maladaptive aspects
of the experience (34,35). Previous studies in self-determination theory have shown that a
positive antecedent variable, such as psychological need satisfaction, predicted more positive
(e.g., vitality) than negative (e.g., exhaustion) outcomes, while a negative antecedent variable,
such as need thwarting, predicted the opposite (e.g., 64). In light of our findings, it appears that
sport identity (a positive variable) is a good predictor of sport well-being, catalysing confidence,
commitment, vitality, and sport enthusiasm, but is a poor predictor of ill-being such as burnout.
Similarly, Hill and Curran's (2015) (65) meta-analysis of the relationship between
perfectionism and burnout found that the positive facet of perfectionism (perfectionistic
strivings) was weakly and negatively related to burnout (r = -0.14), while the negative facet of
perfectionism (perfectionistic concerns) was moderately and positively related to burnout (r =
0.41). Further studies are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn on this issue.
Limitations and future directions
This study is not without limitations which deserve to be commented on along with
suggestions for future research, to advance the AAIS-FR. First, the different variables measured
in this study are exclusively self-reported, which may lead to social desirability and common
method bias. Future studies would do well to use multiple methods (e.g., observational, reported
by others, physiological data) to assess identities, their antecedents, and consequences to avoid
these issues. Second, the cross-sectional design of this study did not allow us to examine the
directionality of relationships between variables or the extent to which identities change over
time. It is likely that academic and athletic identities fluctuate over the course of an academic
year depending on the demands (e.g., exam, competition) and commitments within each role
(6,13). These identity changes may be associated in turn with different levels of well-being.
Longitudinal and/or experimental designs should be favoured in future studies to provide
information on the evolution of SA identity salience, its causes and/or consequences. Third,
participants are drawn from a convenience sample that is not necessarily representative of the
SA population. For example, the first two years of college are overrepresented compared to
previous or subsequent years. This did not allow us to reliably examine the relationships
between academic year and identities. Further studies using appropriate stratification to obtain
a representative sample of the SAs population would help advance knowledge on this topic.
Finally, because the development of a valid and reliable questionnaire is a cumulative process,
future studies should examine other types of validity, such as criterion validity, concurrent and
predictive validities with others variables, or test-retest reliability.
Conclusion
This study is the first to examine the relationships between athletic and academic
identities, various correlates, and well-being among French SAs. This is in line with the
European Union's dual career guidelines (66), which call for systematic monitoring of the health
and well-being of SAs in each EU country. The results provided evidence of construct (i.e.,
factor structure) and concurrent validity, as well as reliability (i.e., internal consistency) and
invariance across gender and sport competition levels of the AAIS-FR. Thus, researchers can
use the AAIS-FR to reliably and validly measure the academic and athletic identities of French-
speaking SAs. In addition, this study is the first to examine the additive and interactive
relationships between the two identities and sport well-being. The results showed a positive
relationship between athletic identity and sport well-being, particularly with engagement,
suggesting that it may be worthwhile to strengthen this variable to improve SAs well-being.
They also showed that academic identity does not appear to be an obstacle to sport well-being
and could therefore be strengthened given its positive relationship with time dedicated to
academic and satisfaction with academic results. Nevertheless, future studies are needed to
