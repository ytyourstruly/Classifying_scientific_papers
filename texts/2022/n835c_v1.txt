ABSTRACT
The Mornington Peninsula Shire was interested in boosting their local economy, reducing
traffic congestion and pollution and increasing quality of life of their residents. It has been
proposed that this can be achieved through promotion of work flexibility programs such as
flexible work hours and working from home. Although the prevalence of flexibility in the
workplace has been well documented, few studies have attempted to identify what factors
influence an individual’s desire to have flexibility. Thus the purpose of this study was to
investigate whether personality can be used to explain the variation in one’s desire for
flexibility in the workplace. Additionally, job satisfaction, job stress, presence of dependent
children, percentage of income contributed to overall family earnings, age, gender and job
type were also included to determine whether they influence one’s desire to have flexibility.
A quantitative, descriptive research approach was adopted and accordingly, a survey was
developed and mailed to 2124 Mornington Peninsula residents, soliciting a high response rate
of 29.5%. To measure workplace flexibility, a scale was developed and Exploratory Factor
Analysis confirmed the two factor structure of “the desire for flexibility”, termed the Desire
for Hours, and Desire for Home, while Cronbach’s alpha confirmed the reliability of the
developed scale. Two multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the
relationship between Personality, Job Stress, Job Satisfaction, and various demographic
variables, and the two dependent variables of Desire for Hours and Desire for Home.
The results of the present study confirm that Personality significantly predicts the desire for
flexible working hours and the desire for working from home. However, it's predictive ability
is low as other variables that were not captured in the model are likely to capture more
variance than Personality. It is recommended that, as a step in promoting flexible working
practices in the community, the Mornington Peninsula Shirecould help organise and develop
several flexible working arrangements that can provide the beneficial outcomes that they are
interested in such as reduced traffic congestion, yet varied enough to cater to the desires of
different individuals.

INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background to the Research
Work flexibility is becoming an increasingly popular trend not only in Australia, but across a
number of developed countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom (Andrews
2006). Changing workplace demographics, including more women and parents in the
workforce and a greater interest in the balance of work and life, are driving the demand for
flexible, more family friendly work arrangements (Rodgers, 1992). Flexibility in the
workplace is becoming a critical factor in balancing work and family responsibilities, as an
increasing availability of flexible work arrangements has helped many parents with primary
caring responsibilities re-renting the workforce, along with a greater proportion of older
workers and more people generally, seeking an improved work life balance. A report by the
Australian Government (Andrews 2006) supports these assertions, and recognises the need
for more flexibility in the workplace. The report reflects the Australian Government’s
commitment to build on and enhance the protections and flexibilities already provided to
Australian workers with family responsibilities.
The establishment of the Australian Telework Advisory Committee is a further
acknowledgement of the growing importance of flexible working arrangements, as the
committee aims to help the Australian Government maximise the economic and social
benefits of flexible work practices. In a report to the Australian Government (Australian
Telework Advisory Committee 2006), a number of benefits of one form of flexibility,
working from home, are outlined:
− Employees working from home under a flexible working arrangement benefit from
greater business productivity and cost savings. These are made through increased worker
productivity, efficiency, and organisational effectiveness and reduce staff turnover and
absenteeism. Efficiencies can also be made through reduction in travel costs and office
space.
− Flexible working arrangements help improve the quality of the work-life balance. This is
seen as desirable among employees in general, as greater flexibility of working hours and
location of work can be used to meet the changing needs of these people.
− Environmental benefits from increased working from home practices are achieved
through reduced traffic congestion and carbon emissions. Reducing carbon emissions is a
step towards addressing air quality and improving the quality of life particularly in dense
metropolitan areas.
− Working from home allows the ability to work away from central business locations so
that during natural and human disasters businesses and government can continue to
provide ongoing service.
− Working from home also helps increase workforce participation. Given the increasing
diversity of the work force, the skill shortages in certain sectors of the economy and the
ageing of the population, this has become an important consideration in Government,
business and community issues. For mature age workers, workers with carer
responsibilities, workers with disabilities and workers in regional and rural areas,
working from home is an opportunity to remain in the workforce. This is particularly so
for rural communities who are facing drought and other environmental challenges, and is
an added incentive to support working from home.
One community that has shown interest in addressing some of these issues is the Mornington
Peninsula Shire (MPS), who are aiming to boost the local economy and improve quality of
living. Flexible working arrangements can help in improving quality of living by reducing
traffic congestion and pollution and promoting a healthier balance between work and family
life. Further, flexible working arrangements can help in boosting the economy because with
more employees working from home there will be less travelling outside of the Mornington
Peninsula region, thus increasing economic activity within the community, as per their
objectives. Further, increasing quality of living and peoples’ general satisfaction with their
life can be done by improving their level of job satisfaction (Kantak, Futrell and Sager 1992;
Chiu, Man and Thayer 1998).
However, these benefits can only be realised if flexible working arrangements are enabled
and supported by managers and employees alike to suit their individual and organisational
needs. Although the literature on flexible working arrangements generally supports the
numerous positive outcomes of flexible working arrangements (Pierce and Newstrom 1980;
Hicks 1981; Kopelman 1986; Johnson 1995), little effort has been made to understand what
influences an individual’s desire for flexible working arrangements in the first place and
what type of person is likely to be interested.
Personality has been used extensively in research to explain the behaviour of individuals in
work settings, ranging from job performance (Barrick and Mount 1991; Salgado 1997), job
satisfaction (Judge, Heller and Mount 2002), job autonomy (Barrick and Mount 1993)
workplace deviance (Colbert, Mount, Harter, Witt and Barrick 2004), workplace accidents
(Clarke and Robertson 2005), teamwork (LePine and Van Dyne 2001; Lim and Ployhart
2004) and absenteeism (Judge, Martocchio and Thoresen 1997). Despite the prevalence of
personality research and the rapid growth and acceptance of work flexibility programs, little
is known in the literature regarding the efficacy of using personality as a predictor of an
individual’s desire for workplace flexibility. The aim of the current study is to address this
gap in knowledge. Justification that a relationship between personality and the desire for
flexibility exists in that flexibility in the workplace is associated with job autonomy,
teamwork and socialising at work, which are also areas that have used personality as a valid
predictor.
1.2 Research Objectives
The main objective of the current study is to investigate whether personality can be used to
explain the variation in one’s desire for flexibility in the workplace. Flexibility in the
workplace can be broken into two forms: flexible working hours and flexible working
location, i.e. working from home. The two main research questions for the current study
include:
1. Can an individual’s desire for flexible work hours and desire for working from home be
explained by their personality?
2. What other factors impact an individual’s desire for flexible work hours and desire to
work from home?
1.3 Significance of the Research
The current study will provide information for the MPS to aid in their consideration of
promoting flexible working arrangements in the community. As previously noted there is
little understanding of the type of individual that will desire flexibility in their workplace.
Findings from the current study will explain how personality affects one’s desire for
flexibility, and help in identifying and targeting the ‘right’ individuals that may be interested
in adopting a flexible working arrangement. It must be noted that a portion of the data
collected will be primarily of interest to the MPS and will be presented elsewhere. It is
beyond the scope of the present study to analyse and present these data. This will be
discussed in more detail in Chapter Three, were the survey instrument is presented.
Several other contributions to knowledge will also be made. Personality and flexible work
practices are individually considered to be large fields in the literature, yet the relationship
between the two is yet to be examined. The research findings aim to contribute to this gap in
knowledge. From a managerial perspective, understanding the factors that influence one’s
desire for flexibility can result in better promotion of flexible programs, and the findings may
have implications on recruiting, retention, training, promotion and job assignments.
1.4 Outline of the Dissertation
The dissertation is divided into four main parts. Chapter Two presents a critical review of the
available literature on flexible working arrangements and personality, from which several
hypotheses are developed. Chapter Three provides a detailed explanation regarding the
research methodology adopted throughout the research process. Chapter Four presents the
results of the statistical analysis that were carried out to test the hypotheses. Chapter Five
discusses the findings in relation to the objectives and hypotheses of the research, and places
these findings in the context of current knowledge.

LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Introduction
This chapter presents a review of the literature on two main areas: flexible work
arrangements and personality. Specifically, the background, emergence and outcomes of
implementing flexible working hours and working from home will be covered. The
development and current understanding of personality will also be presented. Previous
research on the factors that influence an individual’s desire to have flexibility is limited.
Therefore this chapter will explore the likelihood of personality affecting desire for flexibility
to determine whether there is a justifiable link between the two. This chapter will consider
several other factors that may further explain an individual’s desire for flexibility in the
workplace.
2.2 Flexible Working Arrangements
During the 1970’s and 1980’s, a movement away from conventional fixed work hours and
locations had begun to emerge, as interest in the employee’s quality of work and life led to
the exploration of various alternative forms of work scheduling (Hicks 1981; McGuire and
Liro 1986; Kelly 1988). Kopelman (1986) defines alternative work schedules as any
variation in the fixed, 9 to 5, five-day work week that a permanent full time employees is
required to adhere to. One of the most popular forms of alternative work programs are
flexible working arrangements (FWA) (Kopelman 1986; McGuire and Liro 1986).
Flexible programs can be interpreted differently by different companies and in different
countries (Wallace 2003), and can range from flexible work hours, job sharing, working from
home, permanent part-time employment, compressed workweeks, and many other programs
(Kelly 1988). For the purposes of this study, only two forms of flexible working
arrangements will be considered; flexible work hours and working from home.
2.2.1 Flexible Working Hours
Flexible working hours (FWH) is reported to have been in introduced in West Germany in
1967, and experienced a rapid adoption especially in Western Europe and USA
(Golembiewski 1980; Kopelman 1986). FWH is usually a company wide initiative where
core hours remain consistent and a certain number of hours can be ‘flexed’, allowing the
employee to choose the times that are spent in the office without actually changing the total
amount of time worked (Sullivan and Lussier 1995; Scandura and Lankau 1997). Although
flexible work hour programs can have over 100 variants a standard flextime program
essentially consists of the same set of features. As identified by Golembiewski and Proehl
(1978) and later adopted by researchers such as Kim (1981) and Kopelman (1986), the main
five features include:
1. Band Width – Total number of hours in the interval between the earliest possible
starting time and the latest possible finishing time.
2. Core Hours –Total number of daily hours the employee must be at work.
3. Flexible Hours – Total number of daily hours within which the employee can make
choices about stopping/starting work.
4. Banking – Carrying forward a surplus/deficit of hours worked.
5. Variability of Employee’s Schedule – Employees’ freedom to vary working hours
from one period to another without prior approval from their supervisor.
Although there are a number of variations in its form, the central feature of any FWH
program is that it moves away from a rigidly fixed work schedule to allow employees to vary
their work according to their personal situation (McGuire and Liro 1986). Employees who
take advantage of this initiative can use it to meet the demands of home responsibilities, such
as child care, while businesses can also use it to extend business hours to meet seasonal
demands or customer needs (Sullivan and Lussier 1995). The benefits of adopting a FWH
program are detailed in more detail in section 2.3.
2.2.2 Working from Home
Working from home, a form of teleworking, offers flexibility in location that one can work,
allowing employees to move away from a traditional office to work at home (Kelly 1988;
Daniels, Lamond and Standen 2001). Teleworking has been on the rise since the 1990s and is
expected to rise even more rapidly in the future (Khan, Tung and Turban 1997; Daniels,
Lamond et al. 2001; Jones 2005). Teleworking is simply working away from a traditional
office, whether from home, a remote office or working while travelling, and is generally
characterised by a use of information and communication technology (Kelly 1988; Daniels,
Lamond et al. 2001). It has been described as “the next workplace revolution” (Kelly 1988)
and is “one of the most interesting changes in business practices” (Khan, Tung et al. 1997).
Research data indicates that ‘teleworking’ is a growing phenomenon in many Australian
workplaces. An EMERGENCE Australia (2000) survey found that 12% of Australian
businesses have employees who work outside the central business location. According to
figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (2005), 24% or 2.2million employed people
in November 2005 worked some hours at home in their main job, a rise from 20% in June
2000. The prevalence of working from home signifies the importance of this form of flexible
working, and thus it will be these two forms of flexibility – flexible working hours and
working from home – that will be considered for the present study.
2.2.3 Drivers of Flexible Working Arrangements
Recent technological advances provided the potential for a greater use of flexible working
arrangements (Kelly 1988; Frank and Lowe 2003), however it is unlikely that this alone was
the major force driving the increased utilisation of flexible programs (Mattis 1990). The
changing demographics of the workforce, especially in North America, have been well
documented and include: more women in the workforce, more ethnic diversity, an aging
population, more immigrants, and more dual career couples, single parents and women with
young children (Mattis 1990; Rodgers 1992; Higgins, Duxbury and Lee 1994; Sladek 1995;
Rose 1998; Cohen and Single 2001; Almer and Kaplan 2002; Frank and Lowe 2003). With
these changing demographics, flexible working arrangements became increasingly attractive
as they could assist women manage full time work responsibilities and family care roles, or
alternatively help male partners take on a greater share of family care responsibilities (Mattis
1990; Ngo and Tsang 1998; Almer, Cohen and Single 2003; Australian Telework Advisory
Committee 2006).
Rose (1998) argues that it is evident that the changing labour force has also been
accompanied by a shift of attitudes, with higher priorities given to satisfaction in their lives,
through better management of their time. These changes have placed a greater emphasis on
keeping a healthy balance between the potentially conflicting demands of work and life, and
this has forced a re-examination of the old ways of coordinating work and life demands
(Higgins, Duxbury et al. 1994). As employers gradually came to realise that the values and
needs of their employees were changing, it became good business sense to offer family
friendly programs such as flexible work arrangements (Sladek 1995; Frank and Lowe 2003).
Businesses that did not offer these programs to help employees manage their work and life
demands were viewed as falling behind their competitors and missing out on opportunities to
increase productivity (Johnson 1995). Thus, by responding to the needs of current and
prospective employees and retaining quality workers, companies that took advantage of
flexible work arrangements gained a competitive advantage in the market place as they were
attracting and retaining better quality employees (Rose 1998; Frank and Lowe 2003).
Some suggest that the heightened interest in an employer’s work/life quality is also fuelled
by a growing understanding of the benefits to both employers and employees that utilised
flexible working arrangements (McGuire and Liro 1986; Johnson 1995; Osterman 1995). The
benefits and costs of flexible working arrangements, are discussed in the following section.
2.3 Benefits of Flexible Working Arrangements
The benefits of flexible working arrangements can be categorised into organisational,
employee and community benefits (Pierce and Newstrom 1980; Kopelman 1986; Dalton and
Mesch 1990). A summary of the benefits associated with flexible working hours and working
factors influencing an individual’s desire for flexibility, thus this literature review will focus
specifically on employee responses to flexible working arrangements.
Advocates of flexible working arrangements have contented that the use of a flexible
working arrangement should improve job satisfaction, reduce stress and increase
commitment to the company (Mattis 1990). Several views have emerged to explain why
flexible working arrangements may benefit employees.
Productivity is said to increase because employees experience fewer interruptions and can
concentrate better on their work, and employees can adjust their schedules to their ‘body
clock’ so that they can take advantage of when they are at their optimum (Kopelman 1986;
McGuire and Liro 1986; Kelly 1988). Further, the opportunity for employees to choose their
own work hours might influence their attitude towards their job and consequently improve
productivity (McGuire and Liro 1986). Flexible working arrangements also provide
employees more control over part of the work environment and such increased responsibility
and planning is an important element of job enrichment efforts and can be turned into an
opportunity for employees to learn new skills and to obtain a broader picture of the
organisation (Kopelman 1986; McGuire and Liro 1986).
Pierce and Newstrom (1980) argue that flexible working arrangements help in reducing stress,
providing the opportunity to balance work with their body’s ‘clock’, providing opportunity
for greater self control and discretion, and the opportunity to harmonise work and personal
life demands. Flexible work arrangements can contribute to a reduction in job stress by
alleviating a number of stressors in the workplace, which can range from daily commuting,
coordination of work and family duties, traffic congestion, pressure of arriving on time and
so on (Pierce and Newstrom 1980). Many others have supported the notion that flexibility
can reduce stress levels and prevent burnout, such as Almer, Cohen and Single (2003) and as
early as Golembiewski and Proehl (1978), who proposed that flexible scheduling can be
viewed in terms of reducing frustration/aggression. Specifically, by increasing an employee’s
control over their environment, flexitime can be said to reduce frustration, and that the
opportunity to modify one’s hours to accommodate non work demands might alleviate the
tensions often found between work and non work activities (Golembiewski and Proehl 1978).
However few empirical studies have investigated these claims until recently (Almer and
Kaplan 2002). Higgins, Duxbury and Irving (1992) found that conflict between work and
family roles diminish employee perceptions of quality of work life and the quality of family
life, which in turn can impact organisational outcomes such as productivity, absenteeism and
turnover. This finding supports the use of flexible working arrangements as a way of
reducing conflicts between work and family demands (Scandura and Lankau 1997).
A study by Almer and Kaplan (2002) found that job satisfaction among professionals under
a flexible working arrangement was significantly greater than the job satisfaction of
employees under a standard work arrangement. Further, employees under a flexible working
arrangement had stronger intentions to stay with the firm in the long term, and stress was
reduced in the form of role conflict.
There have been criticisms of validity of the findings from previous studies. Several
researchers (Kim 1981; Kopelman 1986; Dalton and Mesch 1990; Frank and Lowe 2003)
have claimed that some advocates of flexible working arrangements, for example Hooks
(1996) and Johnson (1995) base their arguments on anecdotal and testimonial evidence.
Hicks (1981) states that there has been a tendency for researchers to reveal the goal or
purpose of the study to their actual or potential respondents, which could easily lead to biased
or misleading results, making it difficult to assess the true impact of flexitime on employee
outcomes. As mentioned before, even within a general framework, flexible working
programs may vary considerably. This has implications in terms of the impact the program
has on satisfaction and productivity, and it may become difficult to compare results across a
group of studies when the specific FWA program that was investigated differed in certain
features.
Despite these shortcomings, the results are generally promising and advocates for flexible
working arrangements still maintain that the advantages are clear. However, there are still a
number of sceptics that remind us that although numerous benefits may arise, there are some
reasons to not necessarily approve of FWA programs.

2.4 Criticisms of Flexible Working Arrangements
Just as the literature has spawned numerous potential benefits of FWA, it has also produced a
list of potential disadvantages. Disadvantages of flexible working hours are summarised in
Employee Costs of FWH Organisational Costs of FWH
Requirement to make up lost time Inadequate staffing and supervision
Reduces opportunity for overtime Longer hours may increase overhead costs
Fosters job enrichment that may be unwanted Problems in communication and coordination
Creates unequalness amongst employees Requires changes in culture
Employee Costs of WFH Organisational Costs of WFH
Fewer chances for development or promotion Harder to Supervise and motivate employees
Negative perceptions associated High selection, training and support costs
Increased conflict between work and home Harder to socialise new workers to company
Less contact with colleagues, social isolation Must develop new performance measures
Lower job security Costs of additional equipment and support
Source: (Kopelman 1986; Daniels, Lamond et al. 2001)
It is understood that there are also negative perceptions held by employers and employees
with regard to work flexibility. For example employees may feel that choosing flexible work
arrangements may hinder or threaten their career, or managers may view time spent away
from the office is time spent not working, and may be reluctant to allow an employee to work
from home. Thus, as Cohen (1997) suggests, the reasons for employees not requesting
flexibility in their jobs could be partly attributed to concerns over managerial resistance to
having flexibility, resentment from peers, client satisfaction, potential negative career
consequences and doubt of flexibility’s real ability to improve quality of work and life.
A study by Cohen and Single (2001) indicates that participation in a flexible working
program can be accompanied with several negative perceptions. Specifically, they found that
in an accounting firm, employees taking part in a flexible working arrangement had
dramatically lower perception of their likelihood to advance to partner level, were perceived
as more likely to voluntarily leave the firm, and significantly less likely to be requested on a
future engagement. Overall, it seems that flexible arrangements may be perceived to make it
more difficult for career advancement.
A study by Almer, Cohen and Single (2004) extended the findings of Cohen and Single
(2001) by providing further support for the potential of flexible working arrangements to
carry negative associations. Specifically, they found that individuals under a flexible work
arrangement were viewed as less likely, by their peers, to be requested on a future
engagement, less committed to the firm and career, less likely to advance to partner level,
and more likely to be involuntarily counselled out. However, unlike Cohen and Single’s
(2001) study, gender and family status were found to have significant interaction, in that men
were viewed as less likely to stay with the firm and advance to partner than women on a
FWA, and men with children were viewed as more likely to voluntarily leave the firm than
women with children. Almer, Cohen and Single (2004) explain that this supports a view that
males utilising flexible working arrangements may be viewed as outside the norm, and thus
are penalised more than women under such arrangements. Further, males may be viewed as
valuing their careers less because they have arranged their schedules to accommodate their
family needs, and this in turn affects the likelihood that they will advance in the firm.
Almer et al. (2004) presents two possible causes as to why flexible working arrangements
may be accompanied with negative perceptions. First, such a program may present logistical
issues and individuals under flexible working arrangements may be harder to reach,
suggesting individuals under a flexible working arrangement can be a burden to others.
Second, feelings of inequity may arise among other employees as they seem to favour some
employees and not others, for example those with kids. Further, with jobs that have an
emphasis on team based environments, the workload of employees under a flexible
arrangement could be perceived as being shifted disproportionately to other members of the
team. Thus, individuals who are taking part in a flexible arrangement could be perceived as
not contributing their fare share of the workload of the team.
A study by Frank and Lowe (2003) found participants in flexible working arrangements were
perceived as less likely to be selected for future projects, as having substandard performance
in the future, as more likely to be assigned less challenging tasks and to have promotions
delayed. This suggests that, for employees who choose to work from home, the absence of
being at the office may cause some concern with the lack of face time and how that will
impact their careers. By being “out of sight”, employees may also become “out of mind”,
resulting in missed promotions, development opportunities, networking and create a threat to
job security (Frank and Lowe 2003).
The findings by Franke and Lowe (2003) support the notion that participation in flexible
working arrangements results in unfavourable assessment on an individual’s career. However,
Franke and Lowe’s (2003) study, as well as that by Almer et al. (2004) and Cohen and Single
(2001), were conducted using samples within the public accounting industry. Insufficient
research is available to suggest whether these negative perceptions can be generalised to
employees of other industries. Nevertheless, the research suggests that outcomes for
employees under flexible work arrangements include higher job satisfaction, reduction in
some stressors and a better work/life balance. However, these may be accompanied by
detrimental perceptions on the employee’s long term career.
2.5 Desire for Flexible Working Arrangements
While there are numerous accounts and studies of the outcomes of job flexibility, little
research effort has been made towards the factors that impact the initial intentions and the
actual decision to adopt a flexible work arrangement (Almer, Cohen et al. 2003). Despite the
increasing popularity of work flexibility there is limited understanding of why some
individuals with a potential for having flexibility in their workplace choose to take advantage
of them, while others do not. Failure to understand the factors that impact the initial stages of
the decision to adopt a flexible working arrangement may result in missed opportunities by
companies to retain and attract valued employees. There are also implications for training,
promotion and job assignments of employees striving to maintain a work/ life balance
(Almer, Cohen et al. 2003).
A study by Almer et al. (2003) aimed to address this gap by gaining insight into the
differences between adopters and non-adopters of flexible working arrangements. They
investigated variables at both the individual and organisational level. Organisational
variables are those that the organisation has some influence and control over and
individual/personal variables are those that those that are within the employee’s control.
They found that family considerations, gender, importance of colleague opinions, and rank
all significantly affect intentions to adopt a flexible working arrangement. With regard to
gender, males are much less likely to adopt a flexible arrangement than females. Another
interesting finding is that professionals were less likely to adopt flexible programs as they
moved up the ranks. The findings also highlighted the importance of support from family,
spouse and the office culture.
The current study will adopt a similar approach to that of Almer et al.’s (2003), as it will
investigate the individual variables that affect one’s desire to have flexibility. For example,
one factor that is likely to influence the desire for job flexibility is gender. Working women
are more likely to request flexible working conditions because they are more likely to take
primary family and child care responsibilities. Thus, women typically experience greater
inter-role conflict than men due to traditional family responsibilities that require them to
balance the dual responsibilities of family and work (Ngo and Tsang 1998; Almer, Cohen et
al. 2003). Further, flexible working arrangements may be perceived as less socially
acceptable for men, and if it means a reduction in compensation and career opportunities it
may be less financially feasible for men than for women, and women are more likely to take
primary family and child care responsibilities (Almer, Cohen et al. 2003). The following
hypotheses are generated from this review:
H1a: Females will desire flexible working hours more so than males.
H1b: Females will desire to work from home more so than males.
As previously discussed, two other factors that may influence the desire for flexibility is job
satisfaction and job stress. If reduced stress and greater satisfaction are two benefits of job
flexibility (Almer and Kaplan 2002), then they can also be possible drivers to achieve
flexibility. For example, an unsatisfied employee may seek flexibility as a way to improve
his work or home life situation. Likewise, a person that is stressed may feel the need to work
flexibly to ease the work load and improve their work/life balance.
H2a: Job satisfaction is negatively associated with the desire for flexible working hours.
H2b: Job satisfaction is negatively associated with the desire to work from home.
H3a: Job stress is positively associated with the desire for flexible working hours.
H3b: Job stress is positively associated with the desire to work from home.
Obviously, some job types exclude the possibility of having any type of significant flexible
work program. Some occupations lend themselves to flexible working arrangements, for
example working from home highly suits workers in telemarketing, human resource
management, or data processing; whereas it is difficult for retail workers to have the option
of working from home. The emergence of flexible working arrangements has also been
reported as more rapid in white collar occupations (Lee 1983; Armstrong-Stassen 1998).
Findings from Australian Bureau of Statistics’s (2005) study indicate that the majority of
employees who worked at home were professionals (31%), managers and administrators
(24%), and associate professionals (15%) for males, and a similar story was found in the case
of females. This further indicates that flexible working arrangements are still most popular
among white collar type jobs. However, simply because prevalence of flexible working
arrangements is higher among some occupation groups does not imply that the actual desire
for flexible working arrangements should be similar. Differences in the desire for flexibility
across these occupational types have yet to be investigated empirically and the current study
aims to address this gap in the literature. Accordingly the following hypotheses are proposed:
H4a: Employees of different occupations will vary in their desire for flexible work
hours.
H4b: Employees of different occupations will vary in their desire to work from home.
As flexible working programs are considered to be ‘family friendly’ programs (Johnson 1995;
Scandura and Lankau 1997; Hiltebeitel, Leauby and Larkin 2000) respondents with
dependent children can be expected to have a greater desire for flexibility than those without.
H5a: Respondents with at least one dependent child will have a greater desire for
flexible working hours than respondents with no children.
H5b: Respondents with at least one dependent child will have a greater desire to work
from home than respondents with no children.
Recalling that participation in a flexible working arrangement is associated with negative
perception towards career prospects (Cohen and Single 2001; Frank and Lowe 2003; Almer,
Cohen et al. 2004), and that an individual that is in a higher position within the company is
less likely to adopt a flexible working arrangement (Almer, Cohen et al. 2003), a factor that
could affect desire for flexibility is whether that individual is the major breadwinner. It is
expected that as one becomes more dependent on their income, as measured by the
proportion of their income to the family’s overall earning, they will have less desire for
flexibility.
H6a: The higher the proportion of income to the family’s earnings, the lower the desire
for flexible working hours.
H6b: The higher the proportion of income to family’s earnings, the lower the desire to
work from home.
Australia, along with other developed countries, is experiencing an ageing of its population
and labour force, and flexible working arrangements – especially working from home – has
been identified as attractive for mature age workers. This is largely because flexible hours
can form part of a phased retirement plan, and working from home can help overcome
barriers of the daily commute (Australian Telework Advisory Committee 2006).
H7a: As age increases, so does the desire for flexible working hours.
H7b: As age increases, so does the desire to work from home.
It is also argued that an individual’s personality could affect his/her desire for flexible
working arrangements. The potential effect of this construct on desire for flexibility has not
been empirically investigated in the past, and thus forms the main thrust of this thesis. The
development and dimensions of personality, together with an argument for its potential effect
on flexibility is presented next.
2.6 Personality
During the decades prior to the 1990’s, personality testing was viewed as inappropriate for
employee selection and research studies, as reviews by Guion and Gottier (1965), Ghiselli
(1973) and Schmitt, Gooding, Noe, and Kirsch (1984) drew pessimistic conclusions, arguing
that the validity of personality as a predictor is quite low, and its use as a tool in making
employment decisions could not be qualified.
However, at the time these studies were conducted, no well accepted taxonomy existed for
classifying and organising personality traits, so it was difficult to determine whether there
were consistent, meaningful relationships between personality constructs and job
performance criteria (Barrick and Mount 1991). What personality needed was a descriptive
model or taxonomy (John and Srivastava 1999). One of the central goals of a taxonomy in
science is the definition of overarching domains within which large numbers of specific
instances can be understood in a simplified way (John and Srivastava 1999). A taxonomy for
the field of personality would permit researchers to study specific domains of personal
characteristics rather than separately examining the thousands of particular attributes or traits
that are used to describe individuals, and help in the accumulation and communication of
empirical findings (John and Srivastava 1999).
After decades of research, the investigators seem to have reached a consensus on a suitable
taxonomy for organising the thousands of personality traits, known as the Five Factor Model
(FFM) of personality. Several key studies have used the FFM to demonstrate significant
predictive validity for personality and job performance, e.g. Barrick and Mount (1991) and
Tett, Jackson and Rothsteain (1991). This has subsequently led other researchers to adopt the
FFM in their research and to acknowledge its universal acceptance, e.g. Behling (1998) and
Hogan, Hogan and Roberts (1996). Thus, from the early 1990’s there was increased
optimism towards the use of personality as a tool for employee selection, and as a valid
predictor of occupational constructs such as job performance and job success.
The FFM incorporates the following five personality factors, commonly referred to as the
‘Big Five’ of personality: Extraversion (talkative, assertive, energetic), Agreeableness (good-
natured, cooperative, trustful), Conscientiousness (orderly, responsible, dependable),
Neuroticism (neurotic, worrying, emotional), and Openness (intellectual, polished,
independent minded) (McCrae and John 1992). However, the current enthusiasm for the Big
Five model could suggest that it is a relatively new concept. In fact, the idea of five broad
underlining dimensions encompassing all of the personality’s traits was proposed more than
half a century ago. A brief review of the history and development of the Big Five model is
now presented.
2.7 History of the Five Factor Model (FFM)
Thurstone (1934) was one of the first to produce a five factor solution to classify personality
types. Through factor analysis methods, he showed that 60 trait adjectives could be
accounted for by five main factors, leading him to conclude that the scientific description of
personality may not be as complex as it was thought to be. However, Thurstone failed to
follow up on his own study, as did other researchers, and so almost 50 years passed before
this model was to be taken seriously as a worthwhile framework for personality (Digman,
2002). Goldberg (1993) explains that Thurstone’s 60 trait adjectives were too uniquely
compiled to have directly led to the development of the Big Five factor structure that we
know of today. In other words the list did not convincingly encompass all of the personality’s
traits. McCrae and John (1992) describe one the FFM’s most important strengths as its
comprehensiveness, because if it was not comprehensive, studies using personality traits as
predictors would be deemed inconclusive given that the most relevant traits may have been
overlooked. Further, Digman (2002) states that at the time it was difficult for other
researchers to attempt to replicate Thurstone’s findings because performing a factor analyses
of even 30 variables was a daunting task back then, and could suggest many weeks of clerical
work and possible errors.
Therefore, Thurstone’s (1934) findings had little impact on the field of personality at the time,
and the focus remained with the three leading theories at the time by Guilford, Cattell and
H.J. Eysenck (Digman 1990; McCrae and John 1992). Digman (1990) argues that although
Cattell’s personality system of 16 personality factors was later disregarded as too complex
and employing too many factors, and scrutinised for not being easily replicable by an
independent researcher, it was still significant because subsequent studies that analysed
Cattell’s variables were able to replicate five of his factors (Norman 1963; Borgatta 1964;
Howarth 1976; Digman and Takemoto-Chock 1981). Thus, even though his system was
heavily criticised, the contribution of Cattell was important for the further development of a
quantitative approach to personality assessment, and was seen as a more objective approach
to organising the thousands of existing terms used to describe personality traits (Digman
1990).
Specifically, efforts to replicate Cattell’s findings by Fiske (1949), Tupes and Christal (1958,
1961), Norman (1963) Borgatta (1964) and Smith (1967), were unsuccessful. They were
unable to find anything more complex than a five factor model solution that replicated across
samples of self ratings, observer ratings and peer ratings. Digman (2002) describes this
period as the beginning of a series of studies that were slowly building a solid, data based
reputation for a Five Factor Model (Digman 2002). Thus from the late 1960’s, several
competent, independent investigators were already coming to a similar conclusion, that the
domain of personality could be adequately described by five super-ordinate constructs.
However, until recently, these studies were largely ignored and few investigators knew about
their findings. Digman (2002) explains that this series of studies did not have a huge impact
on the literature simply because the time was not right, as researchers during 1960’s and
1970’s were more enthused about behaviourism (which criticised anything as subjective as
personality), and there was also a rift between social psychologists and personality
psychologists, the former demonstrating the greater importance of the situation in
determining behaviour, compared with personality traits.
After a period of dormancy, research on personality traits experienced its most rapid increase
in the mid-1980’s, as researchers attempted to reach an agreement on a scientifically
compelling taxonomy of personality traits (Digman 1990; Goldberg 1993; John and
Srivastava 1999). During that decade, an impressive body of literature was accumulating
which provided compelling evidence for the robustness of the five factor model, with regard
to its stability over time (Conley 1985; Costa and McCrae 1988), its presence when using
different instruments (Conley 1985; Costa and McCrae 1988; Lorr and Strack 1993), in
different cultures (Bond, Nakazato and Shiraishi 1975; Noller, Law and Comrey 1987) and
using ratings obtained from different sources (Digman and Takemoto-Chock 1981; Digman
and Inouye 1986; McCrae and Costa 1987; Watson 1989). Thus, in a space of a decade the
views of many personality psychologists converged to a general agreement: that there are
five robust factors of personality that can serve as a meaningful taxonomy for classifying
personality characteristics (Digman 1990; Goldberg 1993; Mount, Barrick and Strauss 1994;
Hurtz and Donovan 2000).
The emergence of the FFM then has important implications for the field of personnel
psychology, as it illustrates that personality consists of five independent dimensions which
provide a meaningful taxonomy for studying individual differences. In any field of science,
the availability of such a classification is essential for the communication and accumulation
of empirical findings (Barrick and Mount 1991).
In the critical reviews of Guion and Gottier (1965) and Schmitt et al. (1984) they conclude
that none of the personality measures had demonstrated adequate predictive validity to
qualify their use in work related research or as employee selection tools. However they also
note that there are many indications that personality tests are widely used in industry, mainly
because there seems to be a genuine need to predict human behaviour influenced by
individual differences, or personality. Now, with the well accepted FFM, evidence has been
accruing about the validity of personality measures as predictors of diverse criteria, reviving
optimism in the use of personality in research (Goldberg 1993; Hurtz and Donovan 2000).
2.8 The ‘Big Five’ Personality Factors
To reiterate, the effect of personality on the desire for flexible working arrangements has not
been previously tested. Therefore, in order to generate hypotheses, the findings from
previous studies will be used as the base from which an argument is generated for the current
study. Previous studies have demonstrated that the FFM can be linked to work related
constructs such as performance (Barrick and Mount 1991; Tett, Jackson et al. 1991),
satisfaction (Judge, Heller and Mount 2002), and employee absence (Judge, Martocchio et al.
1997), job stress and burnout (Bakker, Van Der Zee, Lewig and Dollard 2006), workplace
accidents (Clarke and Robertson 2005).
Below is a discussion of the five factors and relevant research findings that have implications
on personality’s possible influence of an employee’s desire to have flexibility in their work.
Although some disagreement remains over the labels of the Big Five, for the purpose of the
present research, the five factors will be known as: Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness,
Conscientiousness and Openness.
2.8.1 Extraversion
Extraverted individuals are described as being sociable, gregarious, assertive, talkative, warm
and outgoing (John and Srivastava 1999). It is therefore not surprising that Barrick and
Mount (1991) found that Extraversion was a valid predictor for job performance in
management and sales occupations. Both types of jobs require a high level of interaction with
others, thus being talkative, outgoing and assertive would lead to effective performance in
these jobs. Extraversion was also found to predict training proficiency, further demonstrating
in situations that require a high level of activity and enthusiasm, being talkative, assertive and
active leads to better performance. Findings from a study by Salgado (1997) supported this
notion as Extraversion had a positive correlation with two occupations in which interpersonal
characteristics were likely to be important. These finding suggests that working from home
would not be an appealing idea for individuals high in Extraversion.
The findings from several empirical studies have revealed a positive relationship between
Extraversion and accident involvement, specifically in traffic related accidents (Arthur and
Graziano 1996; Clarke and Robertson 2005). In Clarke and Robertson’s (2005) study, the
relationship between Extraversion and workplace accidents was found to be moderated by
context, in that Extraversion and work accidents are not associated, whereas Extraversion
was a valid predictor of traffic accidents. Clarke and Robertson (2005) explain these findings
by the high distractibility of extraverts and their boredom with monotonous tasks; they
constantly seek change and excitement. This finding suggests that flexibility in the form of
varying hours would be attractive to Extraverts because it moves away from a monotonous,
standard and fixed schedule. Although working from home also provides a change in
environment, it might not be a change that is favourable to Extraverts, as the workplace no
longer becomes a place to socialise. Although extraverts may view the workplace as a place
to socialise, they may also see work in general as an obstacle to spending time with family
and friends and to their involvement in other leisure activities (Judge, Martocchio et al.
1997). Therefore, it is hypothesised that Extraverts will have a desire for flexible hours, but
not for working at home.
H8a: High levels in Extraversion will be positively associated with the desire for flexible
working hours.
H8b: High levels in Extraversion will be negatively related with the desire to work from
home.
2.8.2 Neuroticism
Neuroticism, which is the opposite of Emotional Stability, is associated with such traits as
anxiety, depression, anger, embarrassment, worry, vulnerability, shyness, irritability and
insecurity. As Costa and McCrae (1988) have noted, Neuroticism is the most pervasive trait
across personality measures as it is prominent in nearly every measure of personality.
A study by Judge, Higgins, Thoresen, and Barrick (1999) examined the relationship between
the Big Five, general mental ability and career success. They found that low Neuroticism
was linked to long term success, suggesting that individuals high in Neuroticism might not be
as concerned with their career progression as individuals low in Neuroticism. Neuroticism is
also associated with more accident involvement, because they also have a high distractibility,
and are less likely to take active control of their environment (Clarke and Robertson 2005).
It is not surprising to find that researchers have related burn out, stress and exhaustion to
Neuroticism more frequently than any other of the Big Five types (Bakker, Van Der Zee et
al. 2006). Previous research has shown that Neuroticism is a strong predictor of stress,
suggesting that Neurotics may respond negatively to environmental stressors (Clarke and
Robertson 2005). Despite a small sample size, Bakker et al. (2006) found that Neuroticism
appeared to be the most consistent predictor of burnout, indicating that neurotics have a high
vulnerability to all symptoms of burnout.
Since flexible working arrangements are seen as a way of reducing stress in the workplace
(Almer and Kaplan 2002), individuals high in Neuroticism may have a desire for flexibility
in this aspect. However, as implementing a flexible working arrangement is likely to include
a change in the employee’s environment; neurotics may perceive this as a situation that will
be difficult to adjust to. Further, as neurotics typically avoid seeking coping strategies for
stressful situations, it is expected that they would not desire flexible working arrangements
even though they may be experiencing high levels of stress in their jobs. In the current study
it is therefore expected that having more flexibility in the workplace will not appeal to
individuals high in Neuroticism, as these people are less likely to take active control of their
environment and would not welcome change. Accordingly, the following hypotheses are
generated.
H9a: High levels in Neuroticism will be negatively associated with the desire for flexible
working hours.
H9b: High levels in Neuroticism will be negatively associated with the desire to work
from home.
2.8.3 Agreeableness
Agreeableness refers to traits such as being courteous, flexible, trusting, good-natured,
cooperative, modest, compliant, forgiving and tolerant (John and Srivastava 1999). Judge et
al. (1999) found that Agreeableness negatively predicted extrinsic success, suggesting that an
individual that is highly affable and sympathetic is negatively related to management
potential. Further, Agreeableness is not an important predictor of job performance (Barrick
and Mount 1991). This implies that the fear of negative consequences to an individual’s
career when under a flexible working arrangement may be less important to Agreeable
individuals. Salgado (1997) did find that Agreeableness was a valid predictor in three
occupations (professionals, managers and skilled labour), although the magnitude of the
validities were very small. Salgado (1997) also reported that Agreeableness is relevant in
predicting training performance. Similar to Extraversion, as the training situation demands a
significant amount of social interaction, the interpersonal aspects of Agreeableness may
become relevant predictors.
Thus, Agreeableness is most salient in situations that involve interaction or cooperation with
others (Barrick and Mount 1991; Salgado 1997). Individuals low in Agreeableness may be
less able to cooperate with others effectively and more prone to interpersonal violations
(Mesken, Lajunen and Summala 2002). Agreeable individuals also relate to cooperative
behaviour and conformation to norms (LePine and Van Dyne 2001). Generally, previous
research implies that flexible working arrangements would not suit individuals high in
Agreeableness as they prefer cooperation, teamwork and do not like to be considered out of
the norm. This suggests that working from home might not provide a suitable environment
for those high in Agreeableness, as they tend to like working in groups and interacting with
others. Although Agreeableness is positively related to working with teams, it is negatively
correlated with being a leader (Lim and Ployhart 2004), further indicating that agreeable
individuals follow the majority and do not make radical decisions. Thus flexible working
arrangements may not be a highly desirable for agreeable individuals. As a result of these
findings, the following hypotheses are proposed:
H10a: High levels of Agreeableness will be negatively associated with the desire for
flexible work hours.
H10b: Individuals high in Agreeableness will be negatively associated with the desire to
work from home.
2.8.4 Conscientiousness
Conscientiousness is a personality type commonly associated with academic and workplace
achievement, and is reflected by traits such as dependability, cautiousness, responsibility and
organisation; (Barrick and Mount 1991; John and Srivastava 1999). Conscientiousness is
related to an individual’s degree of self control, as well as a need for achievement, order and
persistence (Digman and Inouye 1986; 1991). Empirical evidence supports the importance
of Conscientiousness at work, linking the construct to effective job seeking behaviour
(Wanberg, Watt and Rumsey 1996), attendance at work (Judge, Martocchio et al. 1997),
career success and (Judge, Higgins et al. 1999) and job performance (Barrick and Mount
1991; Tett, Jackson et al. 1991). Given that those scoring high on Conscientiousness are
motivated to perform on the job, it is possible that accepting flexible working arrangements
may be perceived as hindering their ability to perform well. However the findings also
suggest that highly conscientious individuals would most likely have the confidence,
responsibility and reliability to perform well under flexible working arrangements.
These findings provide no real evidence, either way, as to how those with high
Conscientiousness would perceive flexible working arrangements. However, it could be
argued that there is no evidence to suggest the any particular aspect of Conscientiousness
should be negatively associated with the desire for flexibility. Therefore, the following two
hypotheses are proposed:
H11a: High levels of Conscientiousness will be positively associated with desire for
flexible working hours.
H11b: High levels of Conscientiousness will be positively associated with desire to work
from home.
2.8.5 Openness to Experience
“Openness” is associated with traits such as being imaginative, artistic, cultured, curious,
original, flexible and opened minded (John and Srivastava 1999). It seems possible that
Openness is related to preferring flexible working practices, because those scoring high on
this factor are characterised as being flexible and enjoying new experiences and
environments. Barrick and Mount (1991) and Salgado (1997) confirm the relationship
between Openness and training proficiency, further indicating that Openness is associated
with a positive disposition towards learning new skills. Further, flexible working
arrangements may be seen as an opportunity to increase leisure time and pursue interests
outside of work, which would be highly desirable for individuals scoring high on Openness.
As with Conscientiousness, there is no evidence to suggest Openness should be negatively
associated with desire for flexibility. Therefore, the following two hypotheses are proposed:
H12a: High levels in Openness will be positively associated with a desire for flexible
working hours.
H12b: High levels in Openness will be positively associated with a desire to work from
home.
2.9 Summary
This chapter presented a review of the extant knowledge on flexible working arrangements
and personality and, in doing so, has proposed a link between personality types and one’s
desire for flexible work arrangements. The examination of this link is an important
contribution to the literature as there is a lack of studies examining the factors that influence
desire for flexibility, and no previous investigations could be found that explore the possible
effect of personality on this dimension. The following chapter presents the research
methodology of the study.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
3.1 Introduction
This chapter will describe the research design adopted in the current study and present the
theoretical model to be tested. It then provides an outline of the development of a
questionnaire designed to measure the main constructs in the current study. The procedure
used to collect the data and the statistical techniques that will be used for analysis are also
presented.
3.2 Conceptual Model
The research questions for the current study are (1) can an individual’s desire for flexible
work hours and desire for working from home be explained by their personality? (2) What
other factors impact an individual’s desire for flexible work hours and desire to work from
home? The independent variables are the five personality types: Extraversion, Neuroticism,
Conscientiousness, Agreeableness and Openness. The dependent variables are the scores on
the desire for two forms of flexibility: flexible working hours (abbreviated to Desire for
Hours from here on) and working from home (abbreviated to Desire for Home from here on).
Job Satisfaction and Job Stress are treated as moderating variables, as they are expected to
have a contingent effect on the relationship between the dependent and independent variables
(Sekaran 1992). The following variables were treated as covariates: gender, whether a person
has children (termed ‘children from here on), age, job type and percentage of income
contributed to overall family earnings (termed income percentage from here on), because
they are not expected to correlate with the independent variables. The goal of the analysis is
to explain the variability in the dependent variables (Desire for Hours and Desire for Home)
accounted for by the independent variables. A summary of all the hypotheses that were
model, depicting the relationships among the variables that are considered important for this
study.

3.3 Research Design
An exploratory study is undertaken when the situation at hand is largely unknown, or there is
little to no information on how similar problems or research issues have been solved in the
past (Sekaran 1992). As the relationship between personality and desire for flexibility has not
been identified in previous studies, the current study can be described as explanatory in
nature. Further, to address the research questions and hypotheses, a descriptive approach was
deemed suitable, and thus a quantitative research design was adopted for this study.
A questionnaire was developed to obtain the necessary information, and mailed to
respondents’ homes. The main advantage of a mail questionnaire is that a representative
sample could be used, as it can cover a wide geographical area (Sekaran 1992). Further,
given the link of the current study with the Mornington Peninsula Shire, gaining a
representative sample via mail-out survey was highly likely. Other advantages of using a
mail-out survey include: it being simple to administer; the structured nature of the survey
reduces variability in results that may be otherwise caused due to interviewer bias, and
finally coding and analysis of the data are relatively simple (Malhotra, Hall, Shaw and
Oppenheim 2004).
3.4 Instrument
The instrument developed for this study comprises five sections: (1) Self employment; (2)
Current job attitudes; (3) Desire for flexibility; (4) Personality inventory; and (5)
Demographic Information. Some sections of the questionnaire were included to address some
specific areas of interest raised by the Mornington Peninsula Shire (see Chapter 1). These
sections include:
− Barriers to flexibility: Asking the respondent for any perceived barriers in pursuing
flexible work hours or working from home.
− Self-employment: Section 1 is specifically for self-employed workers. The first two items
asked whether flexibility in time and place influenced their decision to become self-
employed. The third and fourth items asked whether respondents are satisfied with the level
of flexibility in time and place that can be afforded to them now that they are self-employed.
These items were included to capture whether flexibility played a key role in becoming self
employed, and whether actually being self-employed provided a satisfactory level of
flexibility
− Driving behaviour of respondents: Questions addressed whether they are a current driver,
the fuel that they primarily use, and fuel expenditure. The next question involved five parts,
where respondents had to indicate what value their weekly fuel expenditure had to reach
before they considered working from home temporarily; working from home permanently;
finding a job closer to home; moving residence closer to workplace; and start using public
transport. Two more questions relating to the respondent’s travel distance to work (in km)
and the suburb (or post code) that the place of work is based.
Due to the limited scope of this study, these sections of the questionnaire will not be
discussed further. A copy of the instrument can be found in Appendix A.
3.4.1 Measuring the Independent Variable
There are several available instruments that can be used to measure personality, the most
popular instrument is the NEO PI-R, a commercial controlled, 240-item inventory that
measures the five dimensions and six facets of each dimension (Srivastava 2006). However
this instrument is lengthy and somewhat cumbersome and therefore not suitable for use in the
current study. The NEO-FFI is a shorted version of the NEO PI-R, with only 60 items,
however it is also commercially controlled. Alternatively, a shorter instrument called The Big
Five Inventory (BFI) was selected. One of the advantages of the Big Five Inventory is its
efficiency, as it contains only 44 self-report items, and takes approximately 5 minutes of
administration time, making it shorter and easier to understand than other instruments such as
the NEO-FFI (John and Srivastava 1999).
The psychometric properties of the scale have also been previously established. For example
John and Srivastava (1999) tested the reliability and validity of the Big Five Inventory. The
coefficient alpha for the BFI was 0.83, indicating that the instrument has internal consistency.
In particular, the scales of Extraversion, Conscientiousness and Neuroticism were the most
reliable, whereas Agreeableness and Openness tended to be less reliable. To test cross-
instrument convergent validity, John and Srivastava (1999) then compared the BFI with two
other established personality inventories: Goldberg’s (1992) 100 item markers TDA and the
NEO-FFI. They found that convergence validity was also strong. Therefore, the Big Five
Inventory efficiently measures personality in a format short enough to be used in a mail out
questionnaire format, without sacrificing the quality of the data.
3.4.2 Measuring the Dependent Variables
No scale was found in the literature to measure to one’s desire for flexibility in their
workplace, so an original scale was developed to measure Desire for Hours and Desire for
Home. This measure comprised 10 items, five pertaining to Hours and another five items
pertaining to Home. From this set of 10 items, two were used as global measures of Desire
for Hours and Desire for Home with the intention of using them later to test convergent
validity of the scale. It is anticipated that development of such a scale would make a
contribution to knowledge.
Although using a larger scale of 11 or 15 points is advantageous in that it avoids the
suppression of correlations (Friedman and Friedman 1986), it is not always appropriate given
the purpose of collecting a rating. Spitzer (1987) argues that longer scales can lead to a
decline in scale reliability as respondents become more random in their choices and are
subject to an increased likelihood of response fatigue. Thus a seven point scale was deemed
suitable for these items.
3.4.3 Measuring Covariates and Moderators
Job Satisfaction and Job Stress were both measured with single items, seven point scales. As
the main focus of the current study was to examine the relationship between personality and
desire for flexibility, it was beyond the scope to include a more in-depth measure of these
two constructs. The inclusion of a global measure in surveys and analyses is not uncommon
(e.g., Söderlund and Julander 2003).
With regards to the covariates used in the present study, respondents were asked to state their
job type in an open worded format. They were further asked to provide their age, gender,
proportion of income to family’s earning, and number of dependent children.
Overall, the only pre-established scale that was used in the current study was the BFI 44-item
Personality measure. The other sections of the questionnaire were originally developed by
the researcher and the supervisors of this project who are academics from Monash
University.
3.5 Procedure
After developing the questionnaire the next step was to obtain a mailing list of residents of
the Mornington Peninsula. This was purchased from First Direct Solutions, a division of
Australia Post that provides such databases for marketing research purposes. Their data is
sourced from the Lifestyle Survey that this company conducts on a yearly basis, which
comprises over 2 million respondents. A sample of 4,000 residents was extracted from this
large database, with the only criteria being that the respondent is a resident within the
Mornington Peninsula area (see Appendix B for a list of all the suburbs that were covered).
As the sample consists of self-selected respondents – i.e. they agreed to have their details in
the database and to be selected for future studies – the sample was not truly random and thus
the possibility of some bias is present.
This procedure ensured that the privacy and anonymity of all respondents was maintained
because returned surveys had no identifying mark on them, so respondents remained
anonymous. Further, all guidelines and requirements put forth by the Monash University
Standing Committee on Ethics in research Involving Humans (SCERH) for the protection of
human subjects were followed. A copy of the SCERH approval letter can be found in
Appendix C.
The mail out kit included: 1 questionnaire (see Appendix A), explanatory statement (see
Appendix D) and a reply paid envelope to return their completed questionnaires. As the
response rates for mail questionnaires are known to be typically low (Sekaran 1992), an
incentive was included to help increase participation. To help improve the response rate,
several incentives were included. The majority of the respondents (1724 or 81.2%) were sent
out questionnaires with a charitable incentive, where every returned questionnaire received a
donation of $2 to a charity, with six organisations to choose from; Australian Red Cross,
RSPCA, Starlight Foundation; Cancer Council; Amnesty International; and National Heart
Foundation. Information about the incentive, and the importance and contribution of this
study was detailed on the front page of the survey (Appendix A). Out of interest in the effects
of incentive choice on response rates, 200 additional surveys were sent out with a tea bag
included in the mail-out kit, and another 200 surveys were sent out with no incentive. These
additional surveys were identical to the initial 1724 that were sent out, with the exception of
an adjustment to the front page to explain the incentive included (See Appendix E). A total of
2124 surveys were mailed out.
The achieved response rate was 29.5%, with 628 surveys were returned. Five of these
surveys were removed from analysis because the respondent was either retired or unlikely to
seek work in the future, and a further five cases were removed because the respondent was
living in a post code outside of the Mornington Peninsula area or working. Thus, this
exclusion left a total achieved sample size of 618. The achieved response rate is an
of (Sekaran 1992).
3.6 Limitations of the Questionnaire
Although care was taken to ensure that all final materials were of the highest quality, some
limitations of the questionnaire have become apparent. Firstly, the question asking
respondents to specify their Job Type should have been more specific. For example several
respondents simply answered ‘manager’ however this provides no indication as to the nature
of the work, i.e. manager of a child care centre or a manager of a large corporation. It would
have been more useful if the question had asked to state the Job Type/Position and Industry.
Furthermore, there was no provision for those respondents who had two jobs, and so it was
unclear as to which job they should refer to when answering questions regarding current jobs,
for example their current level of job stress or job satisfaction.
Further, if more key demographic questions were included, such as income/salary range, and
marital status, it would have helped in determining if other demographics are relevant
predictors of flexible working arrangements.
3.7 Participants
The respondents (399 Females, 217 Males; 2 missing) were residents of the Mornington
Peninsula. The mean age of participants was 44.05 years, with a standard deviation of
11.346. The employment status of the respondents was as follows: 17.6% (109) self
employed; 57.3 (354) permanent employees; 15.2% (94) casual employees; 4.2% (26) not
working but seeking work in the future; and 1.6% (10) were ‘Other’.
The responses to the open-worded ‘job type’ question accumulated to 114 different job titles,
which were then collapsed according to the following categories: White collar skilled (26.8%,
166 respondents); white collar unskilled (15%, 93 respondents); Retail/Sales/Hospitality
(10.8%, 67 responses); Blue collar skilled (4.8%, 30 responses); Blue collar unskilled (13.1%,
81 responses); Health care medical (6%, 37 responses); Health care nonmedical (4%, 25
responses); and Other (1.7%, 11 responses). The categories and their underlying job types are
presented in Appendix F.
The majority of respondents had no dependent children with 45.3% (280), 15.2% (94) had
one dependent child, 22.3% (138) had two dependent children, 9.7% (60) had three
dependent children, 3.2% (20) had four independent children and only 0.6% (4) respondents
had five dependent children; 22 cases were missing data. Finally, for the ‘income percentage’
question, 94.8% (586) responded while 5.1% (32) were missing. The mean income
percentage of the respondents was 69.98, with a standard deviation of 31.2.
3.8 Data Analysis
Several statistical measures will be employed to analyse the quantitative data. Firstly, the
demographic characteristics of the data will be presented using the descriptive statistics of
frequencies, means and standard deviations. Next, exploratory factor analysis will be used to
evaluate the conceptual structure derived for the Desire for Flexibility scale. As detailed
above, the 8 item scale was to measure the two constructs: Desire for Flexibility in Time
(DFT) and Desire for Flexibility in Place (DFP). Consistent with Hair et al. (2006), factor
analysis is a statistical approach used to analyse interrelationships among a large number of
variables and to explain these variables in terms of common underlying factors. After an
appropriate factor solution is derived, Cronbach’s alpha will be used to establish the internal
consistency of the scale, and also used for the 44 item Personality Inventory.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a technique used to compare means of several independent
variables without inflating error rates (Field 2005). This will be used to assess the dependent
variable (desire for flexibility) across groups. For example, to test whether there is a
significant difference between male and female’s in their desire to have flexibility, or to test
for a difference between age groups. Finally, two multiple regression analyses will be used to
determine how much of the dependent variables’ variance can be explained with the
knowledge of the various independent, covariate and moderator variables.
3.9 Summary
The current study used an exploratory and descriptive research method to understand and
explain an individual’s for Desire in Hours and Home. A quantitative approach was used,
where a questionnaire was developed and mailed out to 2124 residents of the Mornington
Peninsula, and a response rate of 29.5% was achieved. The statistical measures to be used in
analysis were also discussed, and the results of this analysis will be presented in the
following chapter.

RESULTS
4.1 Chapter Objective
This chapter presents the results of the data analysis. Firstly an outline of how the data was
cleaned and prepared for analysis is discussed. Then validation and reliability of the
developed scales is presented, along with results from an exploratory factor analysis. Once
the psychometric properties of the scale are established, this chapter will move to the main
effects analysis and presents the findings of the analyses and which hypotheses are
supported.
4.2 Preliminary Analysis
Prior to conducting the analysis, the data were examined using various descriptive statistics
to detect and fix any data entry errors and to ensure that the variables under examination met
the necessary underlying assumptions for multivariate analyses.
4.2.1 Cleaning the Data
Logical checks such as a visual scan of the data for inconsistencies and descriptive statistic
tools such as scatter plots and histograms facilitated in spotting any data entry mistakes or
outliers. Further, a closer examination of missing data was undertaken to help identify any
other data entry errors. The practical impact of the presence of missing data is the reduction
of the sample size available for analysis, however some missing data is expected in any
research design, and in these instances they are deemed ignorable and specific remedies are
not required (Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson and Tatham 2006). Specifically, if the missing
data is not systematic and represents less than 10% for any individual case or observation,
then it can be generally ignored as long as the number of valid cases is still sufficient for
performing analyses (Hair, Black et al. 2006). In the present study, considerable missing data
was found in some of the variables, significantly reducing the final sample size used for
regression analyses. To remedy this, a form of imputation by using replacement values was
used, which involved replacing missing values with estimated values based on other
information available in the sample. Specifically, missing values were substituted with the
mean value of that variable calculated for all valued responses. This is the most widely used
method and the rationale is that the mean is the best single replacement value (Hair, Black et
al. 2006).
4.2.2 Descriptive Statistics and Testing for Assumptions
After the data were cleaned and prepared for analysis, descriptive statistics were used to
explore the data and to ensure there were no critical violations of the underlying assumptions
of any multivariate analysis. Statistics that were used include measures of central tendency
(mean, mode and median), measures of variability (range, standard deviation and variance),
and measures of the distribution’s shape (kurtosis and skewness) (Field 2005).
Before exploring the data however, some of the variables required collapsing. For example
one of the independent variables to be used in analyses was ‘Extraversion’, which was
measured by eight individual items. These eight items were then collapsed and made into a
new variable labelled Extraversion. This manipulation was made for the five personality
variables (Extraversion, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness and Openness) and
for the two dependent variables (Desire for Time and Desire for Place). Once the required
variables were collapsed, then descriptive statistics were produced to explore the data and
test for assumptions.
Underlying some multivariate procedures and most statistical tests is the assumptions of
normality, homoscedasticity, and linearity. The most fundamental assumption in multivariate
analysis is normality, which requires the shape of the data distribution for an individual
metric variable to correspond to the normal distribution (Hair, Black et al. 2006). This
assumption can be partially checked by examining the normality, linearity and
homoscedasticity of individual variables.

The distribution can be determined by visually checking its histogram with normal curve
fitted, and by assessing the skewness and kurtosis of the data (Hair, Black et al. 2006).
Kurtosis refers to the ‘peakedness’ or ‘flatness’ of the distribution compared to a normal
distribution, and skewness describes the balance of the distribution; in other words, is the
above, the skewness and kurtosis of each variable are close to zero, indicating that the data
distribution of each variable is close to normal. A visual check of histograms for each
variable reveals that all variables have normally distributed distributions (see Appendix G),
thus the underlying assumption was not violated and analysis can proceed.
Homoscedasticity refers to the assumption that the dependent variable exhibits equal levels
of variance across the range of predictor variables, thus allowing for a ‘fair test’ of the
relationship across all values of the variables (Hair, Black et al. 2006). This is related to the
assumption of normality because when the assumption of multivariate normality is met, the
relationships between variables are homoscedastic (Tabachnick and Fidell 1996). Testing
whether the data is homoscedastic is important because the variance of the dependent
variable being explained in the relationship should not be concentrated in only a limited
range of the independent values (Hair, Black et al. 2006). For multiple regression analysis,
the effect of heteroscedasticity is to cause predictions to be better at some levels of the
independent variables than at others, and this is often a cause of highly skewed distributions
where there were disproportionate numbers of respondents in certain ranges of the
independent variables (Hair, Black et al. 2006). As none of the variables were significantly
skewed and all data distributions were normally distributed, there was no evidence that the
underlying assumption of homoscedasticity and analysis can proceed.
Linearity is an implicit assumption underling all multivariate techniques on correlation
measures, including multiple regression (Hair, Black et al. 2006). This is an important
assumption because the correlation coefficient only describes linear relationships among
variables, thus any significant nonlinear relationships are ignored, resulting in an
underestimation of the actual strength of the relationship (Hair, Black et al. 2006; Tabachnick
and Fidell 2007). Specifically, the effect of the presence of nonlinear relationships is that the
r-square will underestimate the variance explained overall, and the betas will underestimate
the importance of the variables involved in the nonlinear relationship. The most common
way to assess linearity is by examining bivariate scatter plots between the variables, and to
examine the residuals that are produced when a regression is run (Hair, Black et al. 2006).
The assumption of linearity was checked through residual statistics as output of the
regression models. As a rule of thumb, an indicator of possible nonlinearity is when the
standard deviation of the residuals exceeds the standard deviation of the dependent variable.
In this case, the standard deviation of the residuals did not exceed that of the dependent, and
further examination of the scatter plots did not indicate any apparent nonlinear patterns.
4.3 Scale Development
Chapter 2 outlined the need to measure the desire for flexibility in the workplace, rather than
measuring the outcome of flexible work programs. To address this, the current study
developed an original set of items to measure the desire for two forms of flexibility: flexible
working hours (Hours) and working from home (Home). This was a ten item scale, with five
items measuring each of these two constructs. Churchill (1979) recommends the inclusion of
some negatively worded items as it reduces response bias. Following this recommendation,
one of the five items for each construct was negatively worded. The fifth item of each
construct was an overall measure of that construct so that it could be later correlated with
other four items to determine convergent validity. The scale is in Section C of the
questionnaire (found in Appendix A), and the items measuring Desire for Hours are c1, c2,
c3, c4 and c5; while items measuring Desire for Home are c6, c7, c8, c9, and c10. After
developing the items, the measure as a whole required purification, thus several approaches
to establishing validity and reliability were undertaken.
4.3.1 Validity
A measure can be considered to be valid when the differences in observed scores reflect true
differences on the characteristic one is attempting to measure and nothing else (Churchill
1979). In other words, is it measuring what it purports to measure? There are different types
of validity that can assist in establishing overall validity of the construct including face,
criterion and construct validity. Face validity is a subjective assessment of the degree of
correspondence between the items on the scale and its conceptual definition (Hair, Black et al.
2006). In the current study face validity was established by asking two experts in the human
resources field to review the items.
Another form of validity is construct validity, which testifies how well the results obtained
from the use of the measure fits the theories around which the test is designed (Sekaran 1992).
One form of assessing construct validity is convergent validity, which assesses the degree to
which two measures of the same concept are correlated, so a measure is said to have
convergent validity if it correlates highly with other measures of the same construct
(Churchill 1979; Hair, Black et al. 2006). In the present study, two items were included as
global measures of the desire for flexible working hours and working from home.
Convergent validity was established by correlating the summated constructs of Desire for
Hours and Desire for Home with their respective global items. Desire for Hours correlated
strongly with item ‘c5’ (r=0.75), and Desire for Home had a moderate to strong correlation
with item ‘c10’ (r=0.69), thus establishing acceptable levels of convergent validity.
Explanatory factor analysis can also be used to establish construct validity and confirm
whether the two dimensions that the items are measuring can be verified empirically
(Churchill 1979). The results of this test are presented next.
4.3.2 Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)
The primary objective of factor analysis’ is to define the underlying structure among the
variables in the analysis (Hair, Black et al. 2006). In evaluating the procedure for EFA, the
guidelines offered by Hair et al. (2006) were followed. This involved an iterative process,
where at each stage, if an item’s value fell below the specified minimum range, it was
removed and the analysis was restarted.
Step 1: The variables to be included are drawn from the 10 item scale measuring Desire for
Hours and Home; however, the two global items are not part of the construct itself and were
therefore removed leaving eight items to be analysed in the EFA. Regarding the sample size,
it must be large enough so that the estimated correlations are reliable as correlation
coefficients tend to be less reliable when estimated from small samples (Tabachnick and
Fidell 2007). Hair (2006) recommends that generally, factor analysis would not be conducted
on a sample of fewer than 50 observations. Furthermore, as a general rule of thumb, the
researcher should have at least five times as many observations as the number of items being
analysed and the more acceptable sample sizes would have a ratio of 10:1 (Hair, 2006). As
there were eight items in the scale, to abide by this rule of thumb a minimum sample size of
40 is required. The current study’s achieved sample size of 618 was more than sufficient to
conduct factor analysis.
Step 2: To proceed with EFA, it must be demonstrated that that the observed patterns meet
underlying assumptions and are appropriate to study with factor analysis. Several approaches
are available to ensure that the data matrix has sufficient correlations to justify the
application of factor analysis. This is an important issue to take into consideration because if
it is found that all of the correlations are low, or all are equal (implying that there is no
structure that can group the variables), then the application of factor analysis may be
inappropriate (Hair, Black et al. 2006).
The first method is to visually observe the correlation matrix to determine whether most
correlations are less than 0.30. If there are a substantial number of correlations greater than
0.30, then factor analysis may be inappropriate (Hair, Black et al. 2006). The correlation
matrix produced by SPSS for the current study showed that there were a sufficient number of
correlations under 0.30, and one can then proceed to examine the partial correlations. A
partial correlation is the correlation that is unexplained when the effects of the other variables
are taken into account. Thus if ‘true’ factors are present in the data, then the partial
correlation should be small, whereas high partial correlations (above 0.70) indicate that there
are no underlying factors and that factor analysis is inappropriate for this set of data (Hair,
Black et al. 2006). For the current study, the anti-image correlation matrix in SPSS shows
that in all cases the partial correlations were small, indicating that EFA is appropriate for this
data.
Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity tests for the presence of correlations among the variables by
examining the entire correlation matrix (Hair, Black et al. 2006). In the present study
Bartlett’s test of Sphericity was performed using SPSS and a significant value (0.000) was
produced, indicating that the correlation matrix has significant correlations among at least
some of its variables. Further, the measure of sampling adequacy (MSA) is used to determine
the degree of inter-correlations among the variables and the appropriateness of factor analysis
(Hair, Black et al. 2006). This index ranges from 0 to 1, with a value of 1 indicating that each
variable is perfectly predicted without error by other variables (Hair, Black et al. 2006).
Using SPSS, the achieved MSA was 0.658, and as Hair (2006) states that the researcher
should achieve an MSA of above 0.50 before proceeding, it can be concluded that factor
analysis is appropriate for this data. The results of these initial tests indicate that the EFA will
produce meaningful factors.
Step 3: In deciding on how many factors to extract, the researcher must consider conceptual
foundations (e.g. how many factors should be in the structure?) along with empirical
evidence (e.g. how many factors can be reasonably supported?) (Hair, Black et al. 2006).
Latent root criterion is one method to determine how many factors to extract, where only the
factors having latent roots or eigenvalues greater than one are considered to be significant,
and the factors with eigenvalues less than one are disregarded. As expected only two factors
were found with eigenvalues higher than one, and accordingly only these two were extracted.
The items designed to capture Desire for Hours loaded together, while the items for Desire
for Home loaded together producing a clear two factor structure.
Step 4: With an acceptable factor solution achieved, in which all variables have a significant
loading on their respective factor, the next task is to assign some meaning to the pattern of
the factor loadings. As this factor solution grouped the items as expected, the two factors
have been labelled Desire for Hours and Desire for Home. The factor analysis solution is
Desire for Flexibility Factor 1: Factor 2:
n = 585
Total Variance Explained = 83.7% Hours Place
Home 8: I’d prefer a job that allowed me to work from home almost all the time - .945
Home 9: I would rather spend more time doing my job at home than at work - .945
Hours 3: I would like to be able to choose the time that I finish work .918 -
Hours 1: I would like to be able to choose the time that I start work .877 -
Hours 4: I would prefer to choose the total number of hours I work each day .843 -
Eigenvalue 2.702 1.483
Percentage of variance explained 47.077 36.609
Cronbach’s alpha .864 .900
Note: Items that were removed from the main analysis to improve reliability: c2; c6; c7
4.4 Personality Inventory
The Big Five Inventory (BFI) was used to measure Personality, which contains five sub-
constructs of Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness.
This inventory has previously established sound psychometric properties (John and
Srivastava 1999), and so it was felt that it was sufficient to only test for reliability of this
Variable n Coefficient alpha
Extraversion 603 0.817
Neuroticism 601 0.820
Agreeableness 602 0.732
Conscientiousness 605 0.776
Openness 599 0.801
Using Cronbach’s alpha it was found that the only value under the acceptable limit of 0.70
was Openness; however the output provided by SPSS suggested that this value could be
improved by removing items number 35 and 41. Further justification for the decision to
remove the two Openness scale items can be found by considering the actual items and their
wordings. Specifically, item 35 was ‘prefers work that is routine’, and item 41 was ‘has few
artistic interests’. After removal of these two items, coefficient alpha for Openness increased
to 0.801. It can be argued that item 35 can actually be related to Extraversion than to
Openness, as it is extraverts who are described to have a preference for work that is not
routine. In regard to item 41, the weakness in this item may be in its wording choice, as the
term ‘few’ can be ambiguous and may lead to subjective interpretation. It would appear that
despite previous testing (John and Srivastava 1999), further refinement of the BFI may be
required in future studies.
dimensions. After removal, the coefficient alphas produced were 0.817 for Extraversion
(n=603); 0.732 for Agreeableness (n=602); 0.776 for Conscientiousness (n=605); 0.82 for
Neuroticism (n=601); and 0.801 for Openness (n=599). Now that the reliability of the
personality constructs have been established, and the validity and reliability of the Desire for
Flexibility scale is established, the analysis can proceed to test the relationship between these
main variables of interest.
4.5 Main Effects Analysis
Multiple regression is a statistical technique that can be used to analyse the relationship
between several independent (predictor) variables and a single dependent variable (Hair,
Black et al. 2006). Hair et al. (2006) emphasises that the decision to select the right variables
to include in the analysis should be made in consideration of three issues:
1. Strong Theory: selection of variables should be based principally on conceptual or
theoretical grounds. In present study, Chapter 2 provided the theoretical grounds for
which the variables to be examined were selected.
2. Measurement error: this refers to the degree to which the variable is an accurate and
consistent measure of the concept being studied. If the variable being used as the
dependent measure has substantial measurement error, then even the “best”
independent variables may be unable to accurately predict it. As summated scales
were used to represent the dependent measure, rather than relying on a single
variable, measurement error is addressed in the present study.
3. Specification error: concerns the inclusion of irrelevant variables or the omission of
relevant variables, and the researcher must be careful in the selection of the variables
to avoid both types of specification error.
The variables included in the regression equation are the two dependent variables Desire for
Hours and Desire for Home, and the predictor variables include the five Personality
dimensions (Extraversion, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, Openness, and Agreeableness),
Job Satisfaction, Job Stress, Gender, Age, Children and Income Percentage. Gender (Male
and Female) and Dependent Child (Yes or No) were treated as dummy variables, and Job
Satisfaction and Job Stress were treated as independent variables but were also tested for
their relationship between the personality variables and the dependent variables, as the
conceptual model suggests. Specifically, it was hypothesised that Job Stress and Job
Satisfaction will interact with each of the five personality factors and affect the relationship
between each personality factor and Desire for Hours and Home. The interaction effect was
also examined for Income Proportion and Gender; Dependent Child and Gender; and
Dependent Child and Age, because they were expected to have an interacting relationship.
Two linear multiple regression analyses were performed using SPSS, the first used the
dependent variable Desire for Hours and the second used the dependent variable Desire for
Home. A confirmatory approach was used as it allowed the researcher total control over the
exact set of independent variables to be used, whereas other approaches such as the
sequential methods selectively add or delete variables until some overall criterion measure is
achieve to maximise prediction accuracy (Hair, Black et al. 2006).
4.5.1 Multiple Regression: Desire for Hours
The first regression that was conducted included all independent, covariate and moderator
variables and regressed on the dependent variable: Desire for Hours. Items that were the least
significant were removed and the regression re-conducted. This iterative process continued
until all variables left in the regression model were significant. The full model is presented in
Appendix G. The full model had no significant variables when all variables were included
and so the model was refined through the ‘iterative’ process aforementioned, until only

significantly explained the variance of the dependent variable Desire for Time (F (11, 497) =

in Desire for Time. An examination of the t-tests of the beta weights is used to further

Of the independent variables, Job Stress was found to be the strongest predictor with a beta
weight of -1.174. Hypothesis 3a proposed that Job Stress will be positively associated with
Desire for Hours; however this was not supported as the relationship that was found was
negative. The negative relationship indicates that an increase in Job Stress rating is associated
with decreased desire for flexible working hours. Job Satisfaction was the next strongest
predictor with a beta weight of with 0.908. Hypothesis 2a posited that Job Satisfaction will
be negatively associated with Desire for Hours; however the opposite was found and this
hypothesis was not supported. Specifically, the results indicate that higher rating on Job
Satisfaction is associated with a higher desire for flexible working hours.
Of the personality variables, Extraversion had a beta weight of 0.426. This finding supports
Hypothesis 8a which proposed that high levels in Extraversion will be positively associated
with Desire for Hours. Hypothesis 11a proposed that high levels in Conscientiousness will be
positively associated with Desire for Hours. In the multiple regression model
Conscientiousness has a beta weight of with -0.276 indicating that high levels in
Conscientiousness is in fact associated with decreased desire for flexible working hours, thus
not supporting this hypothesis. The final significant personality construct was Openness, with
a beta weight of 0.152. Hypothesis 12a proposed that high levels in Openness will be
positively associated with Desire for Hours, thus this hypothesis was supported. Neuroticism
and Agreeableness did not have any significant main effect on Desire for Time, providing no
support for Hypothesis 9a and 10a, respectively.
Income Percentage is the only covariate that has a significant relationship with Desire for
Hours. It has a beta weight of –0.111, indicating that it does provide support for Hypothesis
6a, which proposed that the higher the proportion of income to the family’s earnings, the
lower the desire for flexible working hours. The other covariates of Gender, Job Type,
Children, and Age have no significant main contribution to this regression model, providing
no support for Hypothesis 1a, 3a, 5a, and 7a respectively.
The interaction terms of Neuroticism x Stress was found to be significant with a beta weight
of 0.755, indicating that stress moderates the relationship between Neuroticism and Desire
for Hours. Other significant interaction effects were found for Conscientiousness x Stress
with 0.749, Extraversion x Job Satisfaction with -0.709, Neuroticism x Job Satisfaction with
-0.471, and Gender x Income Proportion with -0.080.
4.5.2 Multiple Regression: Desire for Home
The second regression that was run included all variables and regressed on the dependent
variable: Desire for Home. The same iterative process used in the first regression analysis
was used, where values that were found to have no significance and low partial correlation
were removed and the regression was run again, until all variables left in the regression
model had a significant contribution. The full model with all variables included is presented
presents the full final model.

Of the independent variables, Job Stress was found to have the strongest beta weight of
0.530. This supported Hypothesis 3b, that Job Stress will be positively associated with Desire
for Home. Openness was found to have a beta weight of 0.425, supporting the Hypothesis
H12b, that Openness will have a positive association with Desire for Home. Unexpectedly,
Extraversion and Neuroticism were found to have a positive relationship with Desire for
Home, indicating that individuals rating high on these two personality types have a higher
desire for working from home. Extraversion had a beta weight of 0.120, and Neuroticism had
a beta weight of with 0.090, both findings are the opposite of that proposed in Hypothesis
H8b and H9b, respectively. The other independent variables of Job Satisfaction,
Agreeableness and Conscientiousness were found to have no significant main effect on
Desire for Home, providing no support for H1b, H10b and H11b, respectively.
With a beta weight of -0.095 Income Percentage was found to be a significant predictor of
Desire for Home. Hypothesis 6b proposed that Income Percentage will be negatively
associated with Desire for Home, thus this hypothesis was supported. ‘Children’ was found
to have a significant beta weight of 0.462. Hypothesis 5b proposed that respondents with at
least one dependent child will have a greater desire to work from home than respondents with
no children. To further test this hypothesis the mean difference of these two groups will be
tested with an Analysis of Variance in the next section. Gender was found to have a
significant beta weight with 0.169. Hypothesis 1b proposed that females will have greater
desire to work from home than males. Similarly to ‘Children’, this hypothesis will be
examined with an Analysis of Variance in the next section.
Finally, the interaction terms Openness x Stress was found to be significant with a beta
weight of -0.626. Dependent Child x Age was also found to be a significant interaction term
with a beta weight of -0.416, and so too was Extraversion x Satisfaction with a beta weight of
-0.242.
4.5.3 Analysis of Variance
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a technique that is used to compare means of several
independent variables without inflating error rates (Field 2005). It will be implemented here
to test several hypotheses. Firstly, Hypothesis 1a proposed that females will have higher
4.9 it can be seen that females have a slightly higher mean than males, however ANOVA
results show that this difference is not significant (F (1, 582) = 2.880, p = 0.090). Thus
Hypothesis 8a is not supported.
Hypothesis 1b proposed that females will have higher desire to work from home than males.
females, and ANOVA results show that this difference is significant (F (1, 578) = 4.113, p =
0.043). Thus Hypothesis 8b was not supported because the opposite was found.

As stated in Hypothesis 4a, it was expected that there will be significant differences amongst
that the Health Care (non-medical) have the highest mean score on Desire for Hours, and
Blue Collar Unskilled have the highest mean score on Desire for Home. Hypothesis 4a was
supported as ANOVA shows that there was a significant difference between the occupational
groups in their Desire for Hours (F (7, 477) = 2.175, p = 0.035). To examine where the
individual differences lie, Tukey’s Post Hoc test was run through SPSS. Health Care
(Medical) had significantly higher mean Desire for Hours than Health Care (Non Medical) (p
Hypothesis 4b similarly proposed that there will be significant differences amongst
occupation groups in their desire to work from home. A second ANOVA shows that there
were no differences among occupational groups in their Desire for Home (F (7, 473) = 1.659,
p = 0.117). Thus Hypothesis 4b was not supported.

Hypothesis 5a posits that respondents with at least one dependent child will have a greater
means of these two groups, and it can be seen that respondents with children report slightly
higher Desire for Hours than those without. ANOVA results show that this difference is
significant (F (1, 562) = 4.121, p = 0.043). This finding provides support for Hypothesis 5a.
Hypothesis 5b proposes that respondents with at least one dependent child will have a greater
means of these two groups and it is evident that the group with children report a greater
Desire for Home than those without. ANOVA results shows that this difference is not
significant (F (1, 558) = 0.657, p = 0.418). Thus, Hypothesis 5b was not supported.

Finally, one interesting observation that was not part of any research question is the striking
difference between the mean rating for Desire for Hours and Desire for Home. The average
mean score for Desire for Hours is 5.4, considerably higher than the average mean score for
Desire for Home 3.6. Considering this rating was measured on a 7-point scale, it can be said
that the desire for flexible working hours is generally high.
4.6 Summary
This chapter described the data cleaning procedures undertaken and the tests for assumptions
utilised in preparation for analysis. The development of a questionnaire was tested for
validity and reliability and it showed sound psychometric properties. Further, an Explanatory
Factor Analysis confirmed the two factor structure that was hypothesised; these two factors
were labelled Desire for Hours and Desire for Home.
Two multiple regression analyses were conducted to test the main hypotheses and address the
research questions, and although both models explained a low amount of variance, several
factors had significant main effects on Desire for Hours and Desire for Home. A brief
summary of each hypotheses and its relevant finding is presented below:
H1a: Females will desire flexible working hours more so than males: Although females
did have a higher mean score on Desire for Hours than males, this hypothesis is not
supported as the mean difference was not significant.
H1b: Females will desire to work from home more so than males. This hypothesis is not
supported as males were found to have significantly higher mean scores on Desire for Home
than females.
H2a: Job satisfaction is negatively associated with the desire for flexible working hours.
This hypothesis is not supported as job satisfaction was positively associated with Desire for
Hours.
H2b: Job satisfaction is negatively associated with the desire to work from home. This
hypothesis is not supported as job satisfaction had no significant main effect on Desire for
Home.
H3a: Job stress is positively associated with the desire for flexible working hours. This
hypothesis is not supported as Job stress was found to be negatively associated with Desire
for Hours.
H3b: Job stress is positively associated with the desire to work from home. This
hypothesis is supported.
H4a: Employees of different occupations will vary in their desire for flexible work
hours. This hypothesis is supported as Health Care (medical) had significantly higher mean
scores on Desire for Hours than Health Care (non-medical).
H4b: Employees of different occupations will vary in their desire to work from home.
This hypothesis is not supported as there were no significant differences in the mean scores
of Desire for Home between the different occupational groups.
H5a: Respondents with at least one dependent child will have a greater desire for
flexible working hours than respondents with no children. This hypothesis is supported.
H5b: Respondents with at least one dependent child will have a greater desire to work
from home than respondents with no children. Although respondents with children did
have a higher mean score on Desire for Home than respondents with no children, this
difference was not significant and thus this hypothesis is not supported.
H6a: The higher the percentage of income to the family’s earnings, the lower the desire
for flexible working hours. This hypothesis is supported. Also, the interaction effect of
Income Percentage x Gender was found to be negatively associated with Desire for Hours.
H6b: The higher the percentage of income to family’s earnings, the lower the desire to
work from home. This hypothesis is supported.
H7a: As age increases, so does the desire for flexible working hours. This hypothesis is
not supported as Age was found to have no main effect on Desire for Hours.
H7b: As age increases, so does the desire to work from home. This hypothesis is not
supported as Age was found to have no main effect on Desire for Home. However the
interaction effect of Age x Children was found to be negatively associated with Desire for
Home.
H8a: High levels in Extraversion will be positively associated with the desire for flexible
working hours. This hypothesis is supported. Also, the interaction effect of Extraversion x
Satisfaction was found to be negatively associated with Desire for Hours.
H8b: High levels in Extraversion will be negatively related with the desire to work from
home. This hypothesis is not supported as Extraversion was found to be positively associated
with Desire for Home.
H9a: High levels in Neuroticism will be negatively associated with the desire for flexible
working hours. This hypothesis is not supported as Neuroticism was found to have no
significant main effect on Desire for Home. However the interaction effects of Neuroticism x
Stress was positively associated, and Neuroticism x Satisfaction was negatively associated
with Desire for Home.
H9b: High levels in Neuroticism will be negatively associated with the desire to work
from home. This hypothesis is not supported as Neuroticism was found to be positively
associated with Desire for Home. The interaction effect of Neuroticism x Satisfaction was
also positively associated with Desire for Home.
H10a: High levels of Agreeableness will be negatively associated with the desire for
flexible work hours. This hypothesis is not supported as Agreeableness was found to have
no main effect on Desire for Hours.
H10b: Individuals high in Agreeableness will be negatively associated with the desire to
work from home. This hypothesis is not supported as Agreeableness was found to be
positively associated with Desire for Home.
H11a: High levels of Conscientiousness will be positively associated with desire for
flexible working hours. This hypothesis is not supported as Conscientiousness was found to
be negatively associated with Desire for Hours. Also, the interaction effect of
Conscientiousness x Stress was found to be positively associated with Desire for Hours.
H11b: High levels of Conscientiousness will be positively associated with desire to work
from home. This hypothesis is not supported as Conscientiousness was found to have no
main effect on Desire for Hours.
H12a: High levels in Openness will be positively associated with a desire for flexible
working hours. This hypothesis is supported.
H12b: High levels in Openness will be positively associated with a desire to work from
home. This hypothesis is supported. Also, the interaction effect of Openness x Stress was
found to be negatively associated with Desire for Home.

DISCUSSION
5.1 Introduction
This chapter presents a discussion of the main findings of the present study. The research
questions will be answered based on the findings, and the results will also compared to that
of previous studies in the literature. This is followed by a discussion of the contributions and
implications of the research to theory and practice. Finally, limitations of the research are
presented along with suggestions for future research.
5.2 Overview of the Present Study
The purpose of the present study was to determine whether personality influences an
individual’s desire for flexibility in their workplace in the form of flexible work hours and
working from home. This purpose was supported by two main research questions:
1. Can an individual’s desire for flexible working arrangements be explained by their
personality profile?
2. What other factors influence an individual’s desire for flexible working
arrangements?
Two forms of flexible working arrangements were identified: flexible working hours and
working from home. As the current study wished to examine the individual’s desire for
flexible working arrangements, the two dependent variables became: desire for flexible
working hours (Desire for Hours) and desire to work from home (Desire for Home).
Personality was measured by the Five Factor Model (FFM) which purports that there are five
major types of personality dimensions: Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness,
Conscientiousness and Openness (McCrae and John 1992). A range of other factors were
incorporated to determine whether they would also predict the desire for flexibility; including
job satisfaction, job stress, gender, age, job type, whether the person has dependent children,
and income percentage contributed the total household income. To explore the relationships
between these variables a survey instrument was developed and a quantitative, descriptive
research approach was adopted. The survey was mailed out to 2124 residents of the
Mornington Peninsula area and 628 returned surveys were received, equalling a response rate
of 29.5%.
Two linear multiple regression analyses were performed; the first with Desire for Hours as
the dependent variable and the second with Desire for Home as the dependent variable. Both
models initially contained the same set of independent, covariate and moderating variables.
The independent variables were the five personality factors of Extraversion, Neuroticism,
Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness. Covariates were Gender, Age, Income
Proportion, Children, Job Satisfaction and Job Stress. Moderators were the interaction of the
five personality factors and Job Satisfaction, and the interaction of the five personality factors
and Job Stress. Additionally, the interaction effects of Gender and Income Proportion; Age;
and Child, and Gender and Child were also examined.
5.3 Contextualising the Findings
Overall, personality was found to have a significant effect on both Desire for Hours and
Desire for Home, with only some personality factors significantly explaining each. Besides
personality, several other factors were also found to have a significant effect. However,
overall the model could only explain a small amount of the variance of the dependent
variables. Each factor’s finding will now be discussed in greater detail.
5.3.1 The Impact of Personality
As hypothesised, Extraversion was found to be positively associated with the desire for
flexible working hours, and this finding corresponds to the findings of past studies.
Specifically, flexible hours provides a change in the workplace and reduces monotony of
fixed schedules. Clarke and Robertson (2005) explain that highly extraverted individuals
have a preference for change and non-monotonous jobs. Further, Judge et al. (1997) argues
that the social environment in the workplace is an important aspect to extraverts, however
they typically have interests and leisure activities outside of work that they pursue. Barrick
and Mount (1991) have shown that high Extraversion is related to better performance in jobs
that involve high level of interaction with others. Thus, as flexible working hours allows an
individual a greater opportunity to pursue interests out of work, without sacrificing the social
aspect of the workplace and the interaction with others, it can be seen why extraverts would
find this form of flexibility desirable.
For this reason it was also hypothesised that Extraversion will be negatively associated with
the desire to work from home, because one may experience isolation when working away
from the office and the opportunity for socialising with colleagues is removed, or reduced for
those working from home only some of the time. Despite this prediction it was found that
Extraversion also is positively associated with the desire to work from home, meaning the
higher an individual rated on Extraversion, the higher their desire to work from home. This
contradicts expectations that Extraverts would view working from home as dull and
monotonous and that they would miss the social interaction of an office place when working
from home. This finding implies that Extraverts may not view social aspects of work as high
a priority as having greater flexibility in their workplace.
The interaction effect of Extraversion and Job Satisfaction was found to be negatively
associated with the desire for flexible work hours. This means that Job Satisfaction
moderates the effect of Extraversion on the desire for flexible working hours. This implies
that although extraverts tend to want flexible work hours, if they are already satisfied with
their current job they are less likely to desire flexible hours.
Individuals high in Neuroticism can become easily stressed, do not adopt to changes well and
would typically prefer comfortable and familiar environments (Clarke and Robertson 2005;
Bakker, Van Der Zee et al. 2006). Accordingly, it was hypothesised that Neuroticism will be
negatively associated with the desire for flexible working hours and working from home.
However the findings of this present study do not support the hypothesised relationships.
Instead, Neuroticism was not significantly related to the desire for flexible working hours,
and was found to have a positive relationship with the desire to work from home. Although
not supporting the hypotheses, the finding that the higher an individual rates on Neuroticism,
the more he/she desires to work from home can be explained. Neurotics are described
anxious, easily embarrassed, worrying and insecure (John and Srivastava 1999), which
suggests that even though working from home involves a change of environment, it may be
an appealing move because the “home” environment is likely to be the most comfortable
environment and the least stressful. The lack of relationship between Neuroticism and desire
to have flexible working hours suggests that although neurotics may not have a strong desire
to have flexibility in their time schedules, there is no indication that they deter having
flexible working hours.
The interaction effect between Neuroticism and Job Stress, and Neuroticism and Job
Satisfaction on the desire for flexible work hours was significant, indicating that both Job
Stress and Job Satisfaction moderate the relationship between Neuroticism and the dependent
variable. Specifically, the interaction between Stress and Neuroticism was found to be
positively associated with the desire for flexible working hours, which means that an increase
in job stress for neurotics is likely to increase their desire for flexible work hours. The
interaction effect between Neuroticism and Job Satisfaction was found to be negatively
associated with the desire for flexible hours, indicating that although individuals who rate
highly on Neuroticism may not have any inclination towards flexible hours, they have less of
a desire for it as they become more satisfied with their jobs. A significant interaction effect
was again present for Neuroticism and Satisfaction, indicating that Job Satisfaction
moderates the relationship between Neuroticism and desire to work from home. Specifically,
the interaction between Neuroticism and Job Satisfaction was found to be positively
associated with the desire to work from home. Thus, although satisfaction may lead neurotics
to have less of a desire to have flexible working hours, it may also cause them to have a
greater desire to work from home.
Overall, the findings indicate that individuals scoring highly on Neuroticism will have a
greater desire to work from home, even when they are already satisfied with their jobs, while
they are most likely to have a desire for flexible working hours when they experience a
higher level of job stress.
It was hypothesized that Agreeableness will be negatively associated with the desire for
flexible working hours; however, it was found that no significant relationship existed.
Although this does not support the hypothesis, it may still be explained with the same
argument. Lim and Ployhard (2004) contend that individuals high in Agreeableness tend to
follow the norm and to not lead and make their own decisions. This led to the prediction that
individuals high in Agreeableness would not desire to have their own unique, flexible
working hour schedules. However the finding suggests that being agreeable does not deter
people from seeking flexible hours, nor does it make them desire it more. Thus it can be said
that agreeable individuals have no preference, following the norm, and not making their own
decisions.
Those high in Agreeableness generally prefer interaction and cooperation with others, and
those low in Agreeableness are more prone to interpersonal conflicts (Barrick and Mount
1991). This suggests that high in Agreeableness individuals prefer to work with team and
enjoy the social interaction and so it was hypothesised that Agreeableness would be
negatively associated with the desire to work from home. Surprisingly, a positive relationship
was found with Agreeableness and the desire to work from home, and therefore provides no
support for this hypothesis. It can be inferred then that the desire to interact with others is not
enough to deter those highly ‘agreeable’ from working from home at least some of the time.
It was hypothesised that Conscientiousness will be positively related to the desire for flexible
working hours and the desire to work from home. However, both hypotheses were not
supported. Admittedly, there was a lack of strong theoretical grounds to base the hypotheses
on, so the fact that neither are supported is not discouraging. Conscientiousness was found to
be negatively associated with desire for flexible working hours, indicating that the more
conscientiousness an individual is, the less he/she desires flexibility in their work schedules.
Traits associated with Conscientiousness individuals include self-control, organisation and
reliability, which may be perceived as a preference for a more structured working
arrangement, explaining why high Conscientiousness may be associated with lower desire for
flexible working hours. In other words, conscientious individuals may have a preference for
fixed, coordinated schedules rather than flexible, more random work hours. Also,
Conscientiousness is usually associated with strong job performance and success across job
types (Barrick and Mount 1991; Judge, Higgins et al. 1999), however these findings imply
that simply possessing the traits required to be successful in a flexible working arrangement
does not necessarily equate to a desire for them.
The interaction effect of Conscientiousness and Job Stress was found to be positively
associated with desire for flexible working conditions. This finding implies conscientious
individuals will most likely desire flexible working hours when they experience high job
stress. Conscientiousness was found to have no relationship with the desire for working from
home, further indicating that simply having the confidence and skills to be able to
successfully work from home does not necessarily mean that individual will have a desire for
it.
The final personality dimension, Openness, was found to be positively associated with both
Desire for Hours and Desire for Home, supporting both hypotheses. Openness is associated
with being flexible and enjoying new experiences and an eagerness to learn (Judge, Higgins
et al. 1999). Finally, individuals high in Openness are described as cultured and artistic (John
and Srivastava 1999), thus the prospect of utilising flexible working arrangements to gain
more time for hobbies and interests outside of work would be an attractive prospect to these
individuals.
5.3.2 Alternative Predictors of Desire for Flexibility
This study also examined whether other factors could explain an individual’s desire for
flexibility in their work arrangements. Because females are more likely to take on family and
child care responsibilities and experience greater inter-role conflict because of dual
responsibilities of working and taking care of the family (Ngo and Tsang 1998; Almer,
Cohen et al. 2003), it was argued that they will also be more likely to seek flexibility in the
workplace. Thus it was hypothesised that females will desire flexible working hours more so
than males. Although females did indeed have a higher mean score than males on the desire
for flexible working hours it was not a significant difference and thus the hypothesis was not
supported. It was also hypothesised that females will desire to work from home more so than
males. Again this hypothesis was not supported with the results revealing that males had
significantly higher mean rating than females in their desire to work from home. This has
important implications in that any social stigma (Almer et al., 2004; Cohen & Single, 2001)
that has been associated with flexible working in the past may no longer carry the same
weight.
It was argued that because job satisfaction is positively associated with using a flexible
working arrangement (Almer and Kaplan 2002), lower job satisfaction will be a motivator for
individuals to seek flexibility as a way of improving job satisfaction. Specifically, it was
hypothesised that job satisfaction will be negatively associated with desire for flexible
working hours and negatively associated with a desire to work from home. It was found that
job satisfaction was not positively related to Desire for Hours, and no relationship with
Desire for Home. This finding implies that being satisfied with one’s job does not mean
flexibility in work hours will not be desired. Additionally, it has been shown that job
satisfaction improves as an outcome of flexible work practices due to a decrease in job stress
(Almer and Kaplan 2002). This may indicate that job stress could be a stronger motivator
than job satisfaction in seeking flexible working arrangements.
Indeed, Job stress was hypothesised to have a positive relationship with both the desire for
flexible working hours and the desire to work from home, as it is argued that highly stressed
employees will desire flexibility to help them alleviate the pressure they may feel from their
job. Job Stress was found to have a negative relationship with the desire for flexible working
hours and a positive relationship with the desire to work from home. This suggests that as an
individual feels more stressed in their job, they have a decreased desire for flexibility in their
hours, but an increased desire to work from home. This is an interesting finding, implying
that flexibility in work hours may not be the best solution for alleviating an employee’s job
stress, unlike working at home which may be desired more as an employee becomes stressed
in their workplace.
Respondents’ job types were organised into the following categories: white collar skilled,
white collar unskilled, retail/sales/hospitality, blue collar skilled, blue collar unskilled, health
care (medical), health care (non-medical) and other. It was hypothesised that differences in
their mean scores on the desire for flexible work hours would exist. However the only
significant difference was between Health Care (medical) and Health Care (non-medical) in
their desire for flexible working hours, with the Health Care (medical) group having a greater
mean desire to have flexible working hours than Health Care (non-medical). Occupational
types should be further explored in future studies that examine the desire for flexibility in the
workplace to identify whether this difference can be generalised. Thus the hypothesis was
supported in that there was a significant difference between two groups. The second
hypothesis also proposed that differences in the mean scores on the desire to work from
home would exist between these occupational groups. However this was not supported as no
significant difference was found.
It was hypothesised that respondents with one or more dependent children will have greater
desire for both flexible work schedules and working from home, than respondents with no
children. It was found that there was indeed a significant difference, with individuals with
dependent children having a greater desire for flexible work hours than those without
children. However, although respondents with children also had greater desire to work from
home than those without children, this difference of means was not significant.
It was hypothesised that an individual’s income percentage as a contribution to the family’s
overall earning will be negatively related to both forms of flexibility, as it was argued that
higher dependence on one’s income leads to less of a desire to have flexibility in the
workplace because it may risk, hinder or jeopardise career progression (Cohen and Single
2001; Almer, Cohen et al. 2004). It was found that both hypotheses were supported, as
income percentage had a negative relationship with both flexible working hours and working
from home. This demonstrates that the higher the individual’s income proportion to the
overall family’s earnings, the less desirable flexibility in time and place is. This finding
provides empirical support that can be related to certain beliefs identified by previous
researchers that participating in a flexible working program may have negative impacts on
one’s career progression (Cohen and Single 2001; Almer, Cohen et al. 2004).
Finally, another factor considered for its potential influence on desire for flexibility is Age. It
was hypothesised that age would have a positive relationship with desire for both forms of
flexibility, as flexible hours and working from home would be highly attractive to mature age
workers planning the transition to retirement for example (Australian Telework Advisory
Committee 2006). However, no significant relationship was found, suggesting that age is not
an important factor in predicting an individual’s desire for flexibility. One consideration that
may explain this lack of relationship is the mean age of participants was 44 years, so the
sample may not be capturing a large enough range of age groups to be able to detect any
meaningful differences.
5.4 Contributions to Knowledge
The research findings of the present study provide several contributions to knowledge. The
first contribution made by this study was in the development of the scale used to measure the
two dependent variables: Desire for Hours (desire for flexibility in work hours) and Desire
for Home (desire to work from home). An Exploratory Factor Analysis was used to establish
scales for the two dependent variables, which revealed a clear two factor structures, with
three items loading as the ‘Desire for Hour’ factor and two items significantly loading as the
‘Desire for Home’ factor. Additionally, convergent validity was demonstrated as the two
factor scales were correlated with two global measures that were theoretically measuring the
same concept, and both produced significant correlations and high r-values. Thus the
measure was demonstrated to have strong psychometric properties, and was therefore
deemed to be a robust tool suitable for measuring the two dependent variables: Desire for
Hours and Desire for Home. Further, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was used to measure the
internal consistency or reliability of these measures, and results showed that both scales are
reliable.
The development of this scale provides a significant contribution. Almer, Cohen and Single
(2003) argue that little research effort has been made towards understanding the factors that
impact the initial intentions to adopt flexible working arrangements. Thus, for future research
wishing to explore this area, this short and robust scale will be helpful in measuring the
intentions, or more specifically, the desire for two common forms of flexibility: flexible
working hours and working from home. It is hoped that future research can adopt and even
expand on this effort to further explore factors that impact one’s desire and intentions to
adopt flexibility in their workplace.
The second contribution made by this study is the addition to knowledge regarding the
factors that influence one’s desire for flexible working hours and working from home.
Extending the finding’s of Almer, Cohen and Single (2003), who found that the opinion of
colleagues, family considerations and gender could be used in differentiating adopters and
non-adopters of flexible working arrangements, this study found support for using
personality, job satisfaction, job stress, presence of dependent children, gender, and income
proportion in determining an individual’s desire for flexibility.
5.5 Managerial Implications
This study raises some important considerations for researchers and managers alike. The
findings imply that if an employer is wishing to introduce flexibility in the workplace, certain
factors can be used to determine which employees may desire them more than others. In
regard to personality, individuals high on Extraversion and Openness are likely to desire both
flexible working hours and working from home, whereas individuals who are high in
Neuroticism and Agreeableness are more likely to desire working from home. This means
that personality scores could be used to tailor the flexible working arrangement more
specifically to employees. Furthermore, the results indicate that individuals experiencing
high levels of job stress have increased desire to work from home but a decreased desire to
have flexible working hours. The implication here is that working from home seems like a
better solution for reducing job stress.
As job satisfaction was found to have a positive influence on flexibility, managers should be
aware that flexible programs should not just be offered when employees are perceived as
unsatisfied with their job, but should also be offered even when employees are satisfied with
their jobs, as flexible working arrangements can help improve other areas of an individual’s
situation such as stress, work/life balance, and more time for family for example.
The findings of the current study have implications for the Mornington Peninsula Shire’s
efforts to boost their local economy, reduce traffic congestion and increase general quality of
life. Although encouraging local businesses to develop and adopt flexible working
arrangements can help in reducing traffic congestion and pollution for example, the current
study has demonstrated that flexible work arrangements are not perceived the same way by
everyone. Thus by understanding which factors can explain a person’s desire for a certain
flexible working arrangement, better programs can be developed to match individual needs
and desires, and improve the overall quality of life.
5.6 Limitations and Future Research
There are several limitations of this study that represent additional opportunities for future
research. First, the individual variance explained by the two regression models was quite low,
with the first model explaining 9% of variance of the desire for flexible working hours, and
the second model explaining 11% of variance of the desire to work from home. A guideline
to follow in interpreting these figures is provided by Gravetter and Wallnau (2004): value
between 1% and 9% represents a small effect, a value between 9% and 25% represents a
medium effect and a value larger than 25% represents a large effect. Thus, according to these
criteria the variances explained by the models are considered to be small and medium effects,
respectively.
The low amount of variance explained by the regression models indicates that the factors
investigated in this study are not fully capturing the dependent variables; however this should
provide motivation for future studies of this kind to explore what other possible factors could
explain an individual’s desire for flexibility.
The current study only examined two forms of flexibility: flexible working hours and
working from home. Future research could also explore desire for other forms of flexibility,
not just flexible hours and working from home. This can mean examining other forms of
flexible working arrangements such as compressed time and job-share, but could also attempt
to gain more insight into the two forms used by the current study. For example future studies
could differentiate between working at home full time and three days a week. Similarly,
flexible working hours can include over 100 variations thus future studies can look at the
‘right’ type of flexible working hours program to suit the ‘right’ type of individual.
There were aspects of the survey instrument that could be improved. Certain areas of the
questionnaire could be expanded, for example more demographic items could have been
included to help build a more complete picture of the profile and investigate more factors that
may affect desire for flexibility. Possibly inclusions could be income, marital status and
educational level. Additionally, the question of ‘Job Type’ could have been more specific by
asking not only for the job type, but industry as well. This would have helped in interpreting
the responses, for example without knowledge of the industry, ‘Manager’ as a job type is
very vague. Further, instructions could have been given to respondents with more than two
jobs, again to make answering and administrating the questionnaire easier.
Finally, the sample used in this study was limited to residents of the Mornington Peninsula
areas. Thus, to determine whether this area is representative of the broader population would
require future research.
5.8 Conclusions
The primary aim of this research was to determine the factors that influence an individual’s
desire for two forms of flexibility: flexibility in working hours and working from home, and
more specifically, to determine whether personality affects this desire. Using a sample of 618
Mornington Peninsula residents, an original scale was developed to measure desire for
flexibility, and personality was measured using the Big Five Inventory. The results
established limited, though significant, support for the relationship between personality, job
satisfaction, job stress, gender and other demographic variables in explaining an employee’s
desire for flexibility in the workplace.
The two research questions of the current study have been answered:
1 Can an individual’s desire for flexible working arrangements be explained by
their personality profile? Yes. Although the variance explained was quite low, the
personality factors each had some relationship with the dependent variable.
2 What other factors influence an individual’s desire for flexible working
arrangements? Factors identified include: gender; presence of dependent children;
percentage contribution of income to overall family income; job stress; job
satisfaction; job type.
This study provides some insight into the factors that determine one’s desire for flexibility in
the workplace. Flexibility is still an emerging concept in the Australian workplace, and it is
important to understand the mechanics behind the adoption of such programs in order to
promote the type of flexible work arrangements that ‘fit’ a certain employee (Almer, Cohen
et al. 2003; Andrews 2006; Australian Telework Advisory Committee 2006). It is hoped that
future research efforts will continue to develop a greater understanding of the factors that
influence one’s desire for flexibility, to enable some employees to maintain a healthier
balance between work and life.

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT
Hello Peninsula Resident,
We are writing to ask for your cooperation in a research project being conducted by an
Honours student as part of the Bachelor of Business and Commerce (Honours) degree at

external and individual factors that influence one’s desire to seek flexibility in their work
arrangements. The research project is titled:
‘The effect of personality on the decision to seek flexible work conditions.’
The results of this study will help in our general understanding of the motivators and
barriers to offering flexible work conditions to Mornington Peninsula residents.
To participate in this study, you must be at least 18 years of age and currently working or
interested in working in the future. The questionnaire should only take approximately ten
minutes to complete and can be returned using the reply-paid envelope attached.
