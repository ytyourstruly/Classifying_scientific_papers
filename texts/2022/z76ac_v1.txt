Abstract
In this manuscript, we provide a discourse of issues and resolutions that we should be conscious
of when doing research in the unconscious using backward masking of faces. First, we revisit
subjects that are contributing for understanding the unconscious as a concept. These involve
historical episodes and early episodes of controversial experimentation. Subsequently, we
revisit and discuss topical concepts, such as the metrics and the statistical analyses applied for
assessing perception during backward masking. We proceed to discussing novel and
developing issues relating to masked visual processing and contemporary psychophysics. We
empirically illustrate how these issues bias experimental research. We present and empirically
illustrate resolutions for these issues, such as the application of signal detection theory metrics,
Bayesian analysis and advances in the psychophysics of masked presentations using faces. We
assess whether and the extent to which we are truly conscious of established and known, and
novel and developing issues and resolutions. We make use of backward masking as a rally
point to emphasize the importance of conscious scholarly and methodological awareness for
undertaking and advancing research in the unconscious.
A Re-Introduction to Antiquity
In a previous publication, our introduction begun with a reference to the earliest
purported written mention in relation to the unconscious (Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss &
Chapman, 2019; pp. 4-5). This has been suggested to have been made in the Socratic Dialogues
rd
by Plato sometime approximately in the 3 century B.C.E (see Reber, 2016; Robinson, 2019).
It referred to a purported incident during which Socrates illustrated to his friend Meno that one
of his uneducated servants was unconsciously using the Pythagorean theorem in his walking
route for performing his everyday chores (Plato, 380-385 B.C.E/2009; pp. 70-86).
Further dedicated perusal of the history of the unconscious led us to the discovery of a
prior and to the best of our knowledge first reference of the unconscious in written language.
th
The latter dates approximately in the 5 century B.C.E. and was written by Heraclitus. In the
few fragments that remain of his work, a particular passage reads as such: “…like people who
dream without consciousness about wild and unreasonable events, some people live their
waking lives without philosophical awareness and, therefore, unconscious of themselves and
the world” (Heraclitus, 511-521 B.C.E./2003; see also Rankin, 1995; pp. 75-91).
This passage makes the case that the concept of the unconscious (τό ασυνήδειτον) was
known before we believed it to be so. It was a term of discourse two centuries before we
believed it was first introduced in philosophical inquiry (see Madison, 1962). 2,500 years since
this first reference, the concept of the unconscious is still pertinent to contemporary philosophy,
science, psychological research and involves a variety of contemporary methods for topical
unconscious was, is and most likely will continue to be an attractive and unremitting concept
associated with human cognition (Ebbinghaus, 1908; Kahn, 1943; Schiff, 1961; Searle, 1989;
Erdelyi, 2004; Bargh & Morsella, 2008; Newell, & Shanks, 2014; Kihlstrom, 2018; Elgendi,
Kumar, Barbic, Howard, Abbott & Cichocki, 2018; Song, Wei & Ke, 2019; Haggard, Kaelen,
Saroglou, Klein & Rowatt, 2019; Soto, Sheikh & Rosenthal, 2019; Albarrak, Metatla &
Roudaut, 2020; Amd & Passarelli, 2020; Tu et al., 2020; Tsikandilakis et al., 2021;
Tsikandilakis et al., 2022; Sandberg, Del Pin, Overgaard & Bibby, 2022).
The Early History and Controversies
The concept of the unconscious was clinically first discoursed by – the now considered
notoriously cliche and largely extraneous to contemporary psychology – Sigmund Freud. It
was introduced as part of psychoanalysis and involved extensively criticised concepts, such as
a topographical arrangement of the human psyche, a theoretical-observational distinction of
evolutionary-inherited human mechanisms for repression, and the proposition that the human
condition involves an involuntary apoptotic function that is expressed via the workings of a
death instinct (for a comprehensive review, see Webster, 1995).
These concepts were characterized as unscientific during the 1960’s and 1970’s by
among others (see Burnham, 1967) Karl Popper – in more publications that are commonly
associated with this thesis (Popper, 1963) – for being irrefutable, untestable and unfalsifiable
(Popper, 1950; 1952; 1959; 1960). Psychoanalytic authors added to the ordeal by claiming that
these criticisms reflected personal psychoanalytically explainable issues relating to the
criticizing authors (Grünbaum, 1979). This response was largely considered a confirmation of
the original criticisms (see Frosh, 1989; Erdelyi, 1992).
At the same time in history, infamy, scepticism and controversy were stirred from an
additional front. In 1957, James Vicary claimed that he could boost sales of specific products
in cinema theatres by presenting very brief unconscious messages (03 seconds; 18 ms) at
random intervals during movies, such as “Drink Coca-Cola” and “Eat Pop-Corn”. He claimed
that he was able to boost Coca-Cola and pop-corn sales in cinema theatres by 18.1% and 57.5%
respectively using unconscious messages (Pratkanis, 1992; see also Nelson, 2008). His claims
caused public infatuation and stirred scientific disbelief (see particularly Rogers, 1992).
Vicary, under the pressure of the entire psychological community to publish his
findings, eventually admitted in 1962 that his claims were an elaborate publicity hoax (see
Nelson, 2008). This simply added insult to injury as regards the reliability of claims that
supported unconscious processing. Since then, a multitude of empirical publications attempted
to re-instate the validity of research into the unconscious (Karremans, Stroebe & Claus, 2006;
van den Bussche, Van den Noortgate & Reynvoet, 2009; Brooks et al., 2012; Meneguzzo,
Tsakiris, Schioth, Stein & Brooks, 2014; van der Ploeg, Brosschot, Versluis & Verkuil, 2017)
but a great deal of damage was already done (see Stafford, 2014). Unconsciousness became
something of a taboo subject in experimental psychology.
Contemporary arguments for unconscious processing are still recovering – typically via
silent distancing (see Hassin, Uleman & Bargh, 2004) – from these early episodes of
controversy (see also Uleman et al., 2005). Nevertheless, these early episodes are erroneously
considered extraneous for understanding the argumentative polarity of attitudes that
characterise contemporary research (Kihlstrom & Barnhardt & Tataryn, 1992;. Kihlstrom,
Mulvaney, Tobias & Tobis, 2000; Tallis, 2002; Winkielman & Berridge, 2004; Kihlstrom,
2008; Ffytche, 2011; Talvitie, 2018; Shanks, Malejka & Vadillo, 2021). Instead, our opinion
is that they describe very well the origins of why cotemporary research is so divided between
believers and disbelievers in unconscious processing, and why contemporary researchers were
required to go to great lengths to restore some quantum of faith in conducting research on the
unconscious (see Merikle & Cheesman, 1987; Bar & Biederman, 1998; Pessoa & Adolphs,
2010; Elgendi, Kumar, Barbic, Howard, Abbott & Cichocki, 2018).

This target is usually presented for brief durations (e.g., 6.94 to
100 ms; Breitmeyer, 2015) and it is either subsequently or
simultaneously masked with a neutral image or images that are
suggested to render the target imperceptible (see also Kim et al.,
ence
2010). The effects of the masked target are assessed using self-
reports and physiological assessments (Brooks et al., 2012;
Meneguzzo, Tsakiris, Schioth, Stein & Brooks, 2014; van der
Ploeg, Brosschot, Versluis & Verkuil, 2017). In the case of
unconscious priming, the effects of the target are assessed in
relation to a subsequently presented typically neutral overt
stimulus, to explore whether the target unconsciously influenced
participant responses to the overt stimulus (van den Bussche,
Van den Noortgate & Reynvoet, 2009).
Survival and Refutations
History eventually showed that a controversial lineage was not reason enough to
abandon a promising empirical research area (Shevrin, & Dickman, 1980; Kihlstrom,
Barnhardt & Tataryn, 1992; Western, 1999; Hassin, Uleman & Bargh, 2004; Scherer, 2005).
The general public was and is very interested in the subject (Elgendi, Kumar, Barbic, Howard,
Abbott & Cichocki, 2018; Song, Wei & Ke, 2019; Osman, 2021), research and publications on
unconsciousness continued (Haggard, Kaelen, Saroglou, Klein, & Rowatt, 2019; Soto, Sheikh
& Rosenthal, 2019; Albarrak, Metatla & Roudaut, 2020; Tsikandilakis et al., 2021;
Tsikandilakis et al., 2022a) – as did an equal sum of rebuffs for unconscious findings (Reber,
1989; Scherer, 2004; Stafford, 2014; Stein, 2019) – and the promise that the outcomes of
experimental research in this area can shed light to fundamental questions concerning human
cognition held against the siege of incoming repudiations (Ekstrom, 2004; Norman, 2010;
Kihlstrom, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Madan, Derfuss, Chapman & Groeger, 2021).
Nevertheless, many psychologists believe that validity was and is missing from
experimental research into the unconscious (Gawronski, LeBel & Peters, 2007; Wang & Minor,
2008; Bargh, 2011; Greenwald & Banaji, 2017; Wang et al., 2017). Outcomes for unconscious
processing have been criticized for several reasons as regards their validity (Breitmeyer &
Ogmen, 2000; Gawronski, LeBel & Peters, 2007; Strick et al., 2011). These involve the metrics
(Macmillan & Creelman, 2004) and analyses (Kouider & Faivre, 2017) applied for assessing
unconsciousness, the statistical and mathematical definition for presenting stimuli that are
unconscious (Dienes, 2014; 2015; 2016), and previously unaddressed issues, such as visual
processing and psychophysics (see for example Breitmeyer, 2015), related specifically to
backward masking of faces (see particularly Brooks et al., 2012; Meneguzzo, Tsakiris, Schioth,
Stein & Brooks, 2014; van der Ploeg, Brosschot, Versluis & Verkuil, 2017).
Backward Masking using Faces
Backward masking is a widely used method for testing unconscious processing. It is an
area in which our group has multiple publications and expertise (see for example Tsikandilakis
& Chapman, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Chapman & Peirce, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss &
Chapman, 2019; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2020a; Tsikandilakis et al., 2021;
see also Tsikandilakis et al., 2022a) and, therefore, will be the focus for examining issues and
resolutions for unconscious research in the current manuscript. Backward masking refers to the
presentation of a brief target stimulus, such as, typically. but not exclusively. emotional faces
(see Axelrod, Bar, M., & Rees, 2015), for 6 to 50 ms that is subsequently followed by a noise
image. The aim of the noise image is to disallow conscious perception of the target stimulus.
After the presentation psychophysiological assessments, such as subcutaneous sweating
responses (known as skin conductance responses or SCR) and heart rate responses (see
Cacioppo, Tassinary & Berntson, 2007; pp. 72-119), and participant self-reports, typically, but
not exclusively, for valence and arousal (see Macknik & Martinez-Conde, 2007) are recorded.
The aim of these assessments is to explore the extent to which the presentation of the masked
face involved unconscious processing and/or emotional responsivity (for a comprehensive
Issues and Resolutions
Two important issues in backward masking using faces are using hit rates as a metric
for perception and significance testing for assessing unconsciousness (Enns & Di Lollo 2000;
Kim & Blake, 2005). Hit rates are the percentage of correct answers in response to visually
suppressed stimuli. The issue with hit rates is that they are affected by response bias. For
example, some participants might respond conservatively, that is, they withhold a response for
stimuli awareness unless they are absolutely certain. Others might respond liberally, that is,
they might respond seeing a stimulus even if they are quite uncertain. Significance testing is a
statistical method that using, in this case, a method called a one-sample t-test, can allow us to
conduct a comparison between the participants’ detection performance and chance (e.g., 50%).
This method can provide evidence, given a margin of error typically set at 5%, for whether we
can fail to reject or whether we can reject the null hypothesis that the participants’ detection
performance was not significantly different to chance. This is subsequently erroneously
interpreted to signify that the participants were unconscious or conscious of the presented
stimuli respectively (Stanislaw & Todorov, 1999; Erdelyi, 2004; see also Dienes, 2014; 2015;
2016).
As a theoretical illustration, let us assume that we are presenting, using backward
masking, fearful, sad and neutral faces for 16.67 ms. After every trial we ask “Did you see a
face? (Y/N)”. When using hit-rates we cannot control for the possibility that the participants
can reply using either conservative response strategies and criteria, such as replying that they
saw a face only when certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that a face was presented, or liberal
response strategies and criteria, such as replying that they saw a face even when quite uncertain
that a face was presented. Many researchers might not feel moved by these possibilities and
proceed to test the resulting data. They could use a one-sample t-test and, for the purposes of
this hypothetical scenario, report that participants’ detection performance was not significantly
different to chance.
That would mean that using a biased metric (hit-rates), we have failed to reject the null
hypothesis that the participants’ detection performance was not significantly different to
chance. We could claim that we have evidence for the presentation of unconscious faces (see
Brooks et al., 2012; Meneguzzo, Tsakiris, Schioth, Stein & Brooks, 2014; van der Ploeg,
Brosschot, Versluis & Verkuil, 2017). In reality, we employed a biased metric for perception
which we used to apply a statistical analysis. In this statistical analysis, we misinterpreted
failing to reject the null hypothesis, that there are no significant differences between the
participants’ performance and chance, with evidence for the null hypothesis, that the
participants’ performance was proximate to or at-chance (Dienes, 2015).
Issues and Resolutions: A Theory-Informed Empirical Illustration, Part I
For example, in a pilot study, that we conducted in 2016-2017, we recruited a total of
120 undergraduate psychology students (69 female) (P ≥ .9; p ≤ .05; η = .06; f = .25). The

ms. In one session, the brief stimuli were backward masked with black-and-white patterns for
116.67 ms. The order of the different-masked sessions was randomised, and participants were
allowed a five-minute break between sessions. After each stimuli sequence a blank screen was
presented for five seconds during which we measured peripheral nervous system arousal using
skin conductance responses (SCR; see Cacioppo, Tassinary & Berntson, 2007; pp. 159-164).
After the five-second interval, participants in the neutral-mask session were asked to decide
how many stimuli were presented during the trial. Participants were asked to press “1” if they
saw one face or “2” if the saw two faces, using the keyboard. Conversely, in the pattern-mask
session participants were asked “Did you see a face? (Y/N)”.

The stimuli were presented for 16.67 ms (60Hz monitor) and were masked either by a black and white pattern in one
session or a neutral face in one session. Skin-conductance responses were measured from the left hand (index/first and
middle/second fingers) of each participant using disposable Ag/AgCl gelled electrodes. The signals were received by a
BIOPAC System, EDA100C in units of microsiemens and recorded in AcqKnowledge (Braithwaite, Watson, Jones, &
Rowe, 2013). The presence of a phasic skin conductance response was defined as an unambiguous increase (.01 μS) with
respect to each pre-target SCR score occurring one to three seconds post-stimulus offset (Critchley, 2002; Williams et al.,
2005). After the SCR assessment participants were asked whether they a face during the presentation (Y/N) for the pattern
mask session or whether they saw one of two faces during the presentation for the neutral mask session (1/2).
The detection results for the neutral-mask session were overall 50.09% (SD = 1.29%’
). If we compare our results to chance using a one-sample t-test (50%) we get t (119) = 1.26; p
= .211 with an effect size – that is very frequently not presented for this type of analysis because
it requires manual calculations (Rosnow & Rosenthal, 2003) – defined as 𝑑 =

= .07. Our results showed that detection performance
𝑆𝐷 (𝑛−1 )
was not significantly different to chance. Our SCR scores showed that there were significant
differences between Types of Emotion (Fear vs Sadness vs Neutral) (F (1.77, 210.43) = 251.23;
p < .001; η = 68; ε = .88; Greenhouse-Geisser corrected). Further Bonferroni corrected
comparisons revealed that fearful faces (M = .125; SD = .035) led to higher SCR compared to
sad (M = .065; SD = .021; p < .001; d = 2.23) and neutral faces (M = .052; SD = .022; p < .001;
d = 2.71). Our study showed outcomes for higher arousal as measured by SCR (μS) for fearful
compared to sad and neutral faces that were presented unconsciously to the participants. Many
researchers could see these results as a reason for compiling a manuscript for publication. We
see these results as a reason for concern
. Hit-rates are as mentioned above subject to conservative and liberal response strategies
and criteria (Stanislaw & Todorov, 1999). Instead of hit-rates, we can use receiver operating
characteristics, such as sensitivity index A. We propose in particular sensitivity index A based
on advantages that A has compared to d', A’ and A’’. For example, compared to d’, A is a
nonparametric index and does not include any specific assumptions about the shape of the
underlying distribution. Sensitivity index A can provide an index for zero values, such as zero
hits or miss responses, and provides diagonal Euclidean corrections to the A’ and A’’ metrics
for scores that lie in the upper left quadrant of the ROC curve (see Zhang & Mueller, 2005; pp.
204-207). Sensitivity index A can also be calculated with dedicated software that are not part
of more complex statistical analyses packages (Macmillan & Creelman, 2004; see
Sensitivity index A can provide a ratio between hits, responding that a masked face was
presented when a masked was presented, and false alarms, responding that a masked face was
presented when a masked face was not presented. This approach, by taking into account “error”
as a contributing variable to the assessment of perceptual performance, is not affected by
conservative or liberal strategies and can provide a reliable metric for the perception of visually
suppressed stimuli.
Conversely, significance testing cannot provide us with evidence that perception is at-
chance. This method can only provide us with evidence that we have failed to reject the null
hypothesis that perception was not significantly different to chance. Bayesian analysis, on the
other hand, can provide direct evidence for chance-level perception. In this case, Bayesian
analysis requires a lower (LB) and an upper bound (UB) for chance-level perception. These are
called credible intervals. They stand for the lowest and highest values within which we can,
based on previous research and a theoretically-driven rationale (Schönbrodt & Wagenmakers,
2018) or based on rationally justified study-specific values (Dienes, Coulton & Heather, 2018),
define an acceptable range for exploring whether participants were proximate to chance-level
perception (e.g., A = .5; Lower Bound (LB) = .4 or .45; Upper Bound (UP) = .6 or
chance-level
,55; see Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derfuss & Chapman, 2019; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Madan, Derfuss,
Chapman & Groeger, 2021), It requires the standard error of the population sample and a
simple deduction of the sample mean from chance to provide a Bayes Factor (BF; see Dienes,
2014). Using these parameters, we can calculate a BF that will signify at BF < .33 direct
evidence for the null (chance-level perception), at .33 < BF < 3 that the results are inconclusive
and at BF > 3 evidence for the likelihood of the data being observed under the alternate
hypothesis (see Dienes, 2015; 2016; for Bayesian metrics presented above see
When applying sensitivity metric A in our data, we report that overall the detection
performance in our pilot study was .61 (SD = .03). We could calculate the standard error using
any standard interactive software (e.g., SPSS, STATA, MEDCALC) but for transparency

.002. A Bayesian analyses with meaningful interval for chance-level performance for our
participants would be between a lower bound of .5 (absolute chance) and upper bounds of .55
(conservative interval) or .6 (liberal interval). Our mean difference between chance (.5) and
our population (.61) is .11. Using these simple scores, we can fully populate the Dienes
Bayesian analysis we get, for both our conservative and liberal upper bounds, a BF = +∞. This
is signifying that the likelihood of the data being observed under the alternative hypothesis is
almost certain. The participants were conscious.
Issues and Resolutions: A Theory-Informed Empirical Illustration, Part II
The same participants were presented in randomised order with masked fearful, sad and
neutral faces, and Gaussian blurs with either neutral-face masks or pattern masks. Returning to
the neutral-face mask session, participants reported A = .69 (SD = .04) for masked fearful faces,
A = .61 (SD = .03) for sad faces and A = .52 (SD = .02) for neutral faces, aggregating to A =
.61 (SD = .03) for overall detection performance. If we apply the same metrics in the pattern-
mask session, participants report an A = .56 (SD = .02) for fearful faces, A = .55 (SD = .03)
for sad faces and A = .55 (SD = .04) for neutral faces, aggregating to A = .56 (SD = .03). If we
input these scores in a repeated measures ANOVA with independent variables Type of
Masking (Neutral-Face vs Pattern) and Type of Emotion (Fearful vs Sad vs Neutral) we find
significant differences between Types of Masking (F (1, 119) = 1195.28; p < .001; η = .91),
Types of Emotions (F (1.5, 178.83) = 796.03; p < .001; η = .87; ε = .92; Greenhouse-Geisser
corrected) and a significant interaction (F (1.47, 174.74) = 44.59; p < .001; η = .27; ε = .91;
Greenhouse-Geisser corrected).
Further analyses reveals that the neutral-mask session was significantly higher for
overall detection performance compared to the pattern-mask session (p < .001; d = 2.33).
Bonferroni corrected comparisons showed that neutral-masked fearful faces were higher than
neutral-masked sad (p < .001; d = 2.26) and neutral faces (p < .001; d = 5.38), and pattern-
masked fearful (p < .001; d = 4.11) sad (p < .001; d = 3.96) and neutral faces (p < .001; d =
3.5). Neutral-masked sad faces were higher than neutral-masked neutral faces (p < .001; d =
3.53), pattern-masked fearful (p < .001; d = 1.96), sad (p < .001; d = 2) and neutral faces (p <
.001; d = 1.69).
Until now these results make the simple case that pattern masks are better than neutral
face masks for visually suppressing fearful, sad and neutral faces. It is a simple point elaborated
thoroughly because what comes next could perhaps lead us to a small topical epiphany.
Contrary to our results until now, neutral-masked neutral faces were lower for detection
performance than pattern-masked fearful (p < .001; d = - 2), sad (p < .001; d = - 1.18) and
neutral faces (p < .001; d = - .95). These effects are contrary to the higher detection for neutral-
masked session compared to the patterned-masked session effects we had consistently reported
till now. They present us with a seemingly unexplained effect for neutral-masked neutral faces.
masked neutral faces with neutral faces.
While detection performance was higher for fearful and sad neutral-masked faces
compared to pattern-masked faces due to masked-to-mask stimulus mismatch, neutral faces
were masked with the same stimulus type. We tried to “hide” neutral faces behind neutral faces.
This has resulted in the only occasion in our entire design of a BF of .7 that approximated
evidence that faces were presented to the participants without conscious awareness. This is
particularly insidious in designs that compare one or more neutral-masked emotional stimuli
to neutral-masked neutral faces on the simple grounds of assessing the psychophysiology or
participant ratings between perceptible emotional stimuli and marginally imperceptible neutral
stimuli. It can result in exaggerated effect sizes between conscious emotional faces compared
to marginally unconscious neutral ones (Balconi & Lucchiari, 2007). Several other factors such
as age, gender, cultural origin and cultural dialects, racial incongruency and stable emotional
predispositions in neutral face-masks can further bias our results when using neutral faces as
masks to other masked faces (Kim et al., 2010; see also Adams Garrido, Albohn, Hess & Kleck,
2016).
With these in mind and the outcomes of our study at hand, we hope we will not read
too radical if we propose that the traditional way of masking emotional faces with neutral faces
(Brooks et al., 2012; Meneguzzo, Tsakiris, Schioth, Stein & Brooks, 2014; van der Ploeg,
Brosschot, Versluis & Verkuil, 2017) should be avoided, and that pattern masks are the better
To further help the interested researcher explore and potentially implement these changes, in
their own research design we have made open access a set of pattern masks that in previous
experimental pilots have provided evidence for replicating the above effects along with easy-
to-use coding scripts for including these masks to their own experimental code
The Issue with Resolutions
Purportedly established and known issues and resolutions in backwards masking using
faces have been to the best of our ability revisited, explained and empirically illustrated. The
five most recent non-clinical meta-analyses in this area show explicitly that this was required.
The five most recent topical meta-analyses show explicitly that these issues are not addressed,
and these resolutions are not t (van den Bussche, Van den Noortgate & Reynvoet, 2009; Brooks
et al., 2012; Meneguzzo, Tsakiris, Schioth, Stein & Brooks, 2014; van der Ploeg, Brosschot,
Versluis & Verkuil, 2017; Mertens & Engelhard, 2020).
In van den Bussche, van den Noortgate and Reynvoet (2009; pp. 455-459), we are
presented with twenty-three studies using backward masking. Three studies use signal
detection theory metrics (d’) and no study uses Bayesian analysis. In Brooks and colleagues
(2012; pp 2064-2065), we are presented with a total of thirty-four studies, eleven of which
employ backward masking, three of which utilize signal detection theory metrics (d’), and none
of which uses Bayesian analysis. Similarly, in Meneguzzo, Tsakiris, Schioth, Stein and Brooks,
(2014; pp. 4-5), we are presented with an additional nine studies, three of which use signal
detection metrics (d’) and none of which uses Bayesian analysis. In van der Ploeg, Brosschot,
Versluis and Verkuil, (2017; pp. 134-140), we are presented with an impressive array of sixty-
five studies, nineteen of which employ backward masking, seven of which employ signal
detection metrics (d’ & A') and none of which employ Bayesian analysis. To their credit, the
specific authors are the only ones in the relevant list who raise the issue of the lack of using
signal detection theory measures for assessing subliminal processing (van der Ploeg,
Brosschot, Versluis & Verkuil, 2017; pp .149-150). Finally, in Mertens and Engelhard (2020;
pp. 259-261), we are presented with thirty studies, eleven of which employed backward
masking, four of which used signal detection theory measures (d’ & A’) and none of which
used Bayesian analysis.
The available bibliography (see Stanley, 2017) shows that from 2009 until 2020 a total
of seventy-three studies using backwards masking of faces have been assessed by meta-analytic
research. Twenty of these studies used d’ or A’ instead of hit-rats for assessing detection
performance and no study used Bayesian analysis for assessing whether the participants were
unconscious of the presented facial stimuli. We hope that this synopsis makes its own case. We
trust that, as a result, we are now more aware as to why our previous revisit of issues and
resolutions was pedagogically and practically important, and that, therefore, we can continue
to exploratory and novel issues relating to psychophysics and image processing.
Contemporary Psychophysics and Image Processing
The typical processing of masked emotional faces includes cropping, adjustments for
interpupillary distance and grey-scaling. These refer, respectively and in very approachable
terms, to placing a face into a cropped circle that will include only facial characteristics and
remove the image background, adjusting the positioning of the eyes at fixation within the
cropping circle and – arguably (see Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2020a; 2020b)
– removing colour artifacts in facial expressions by using shades of grey for presenting these
1. Original Stimuli from Gur and Colleagues (2002)
to right fearful. happy and sad expressions are presented. The processing of such expressions typically involves cropping into a fixed size
oval with pure white backgrounds (2.). Then the images are subjected to Gray-scaling (3.) to remove between-stimuli colour contrast
artifacts and presented as part of an experimental design (Brooks et al., 2012; Meneguzzo, Tsakiris, Schioth, Stein & Brooks, 2014; van
der Ploeg, Brosschot, Versluis & Verkuil, 2017).
It is arguably clear to the naked eye that there are luminosity differences between the
these facial images maintained the colour contrast of the original images and merely transcribed
it to diverse shades of grey. We can confirm this by applying Fourier transformations to the
images. Fourier transformation is a technique that can be summarised for the purposes of the
current manuscript as divided in continuous (CFT) and discrete (DFT) transformations,
meaning respectively the processing of continuous stimuli, such as a short film or series of
images, and the processing of a single static image. It can give us a numerical value as well as
one-dimensional and multi-dimensional outcomes for the low and high frequency components
of our images. The low frequency components in our case represent luminosity, and the higher
components represent the edges, lumens distribution and the structure of the assessed image
(Guo, Ma & Zhang, 2008). There are open-source software that can do it for us with minimal
M = 142.8 lm M = 119.48 lm M = 179.74 lm
SD = 15.79 lm SD = 20.65 lm SD = 29.3 lm
presented in units of lumens. Instead of convolutional base filtering and multiplication by each pixel this methods allow us to
map and calculate the low frequency components in the centre of the image, i.e. luminosity, and the high frequency
components, structure and edge in the peripheral/bilateral regions of the plot. In this case the luminosity scores of the three
images provide simple z-score evidence for being ≥ ±2/3 standard deviations among images and confirm our initial code
interpretation that applying grayscale corrections to these facial images maintained the colour contrast of the original images
and merely transcribed it to diverse shades of grey.
Psychophysics and Image Processing: Empirical Illustration, Part I
In a series of pilot studies in 2018-2019 that were performed within the context of
publishing three very sensitive as regards the psychophysics properties of masked stimuli
studies (Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2020a; 2020b; Tsikandilakis, Bali,
Haralabopoulos, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2020), we tested the effects of grayscale corrections in
signal detection. We tested using between-subjects designs the detection of masked images
with low, medium and high frequency lumens, with low, medium and high lumens pattern
masks and finally, using SHINE, MATLAB (Willenbockel, Sadr, Fiset, Horne, Gosselin &
Tanaka, 2010), with equivalent lumens contrast.
In one experimental pilot, a total of 60 undergraduate psychology students (31 female)
(P ≥ .9; p ≤ .05; η = .06; f = .25) were recruited. Their average age was 22.34 (SD = 1.91).
(1-β) p
In this experimental pilot participants were presented with sixty fearful, sad and neutral faces,
and one-hundred-eighty Gaussian blurs for 16.67 ms. These stimuli were masked with a black-
and-white pattern that lasted for 116.67 ms. The experiment was divided in three sessions with
a 5-minute breaks between sessions and order of sessions randomised. Each session included
twenty fearful, sad and neutral faces, and sixty Gaussian blurs, In one session, the faces and
Gaussian blurs were adjusted at high lumens (M = 160; SD = 20.17), in one session,
overall average
they were adjusted at medium lumens (M = 140; SD = 19.12) and in one session,
overall average
they were adjusted at low lumens (M = 120; SD = 21.03; Willenbockel er al., 2010).
overall average
In all sessions, the stimuli were masked with an adjusted at mid lumens values mask (M = 140;
SD = 19.18). One second after each presentation in each session, participants were asked “Did
you see a face (Y/N)”. After that task participants were asked to rate from “1” (not at all) to
“9” (extremely) their confidence for their response.
Significant differences were shown among sessions for Detection Performance (F (2,
2 2
118) = 372.67; p < .001; η = .86) and Type of Emotion (F (2, 118) = 173.89; p < .001; η =
p p
.75), and a significant Detection Performance by Emotion Interaction was also reported (F (4,
236) = 31.07; p < .001; η = .35). Further Bonferroni corrected comparisons showed that the
high lumens session (M = .66; SD = .04) was higher for sensitivity index A than the low (M =
.63; SD = .03; p < .001; d = .85) and mid lumens sessions (M = .55; SD = .02; p < .001; d =
3.48). The low lumens session was also higher than the mid lumens session (p < .001; d = 3.14).
Similar results were reported for confidence ratings. Significant differences were shown
between sessions for Detection Performance (F (2, 118) = 1705.12; p < .001; η = .97) and
Type of Emotion (F (2, 118) = 61.45; p < .001; η = .51), and a significant Detection
Performance by Emotion Interaction was reported (F (4, 236) = 4.35; p < .001; η = .07).
Further Bonferroni corrected comparisons showed that the high lumens session (M = 8.11; SD
= .54) was higher for confidence ratings than the low (M = 6.77; SD = .45; p < .001; d = 2.69)
and mid lumens sessions (M = 4.79; SD = .43; p < .001; d = 6.8). The low lumens session was
also higher than the mid lumens session (p < .001; d = 4.49). These results suggested that the
lumens level of the masked stimuli influenced detection performance and confidence for
detection (see also Appendix 1A & 1B).
Psychophysics and Image Processing: Empirical Illustration, Part IΙ
In a second experimental pilot, a total of 60 undergraduate psychology students (33
female) (P ≥ .9; p ≤ .05; η = .06; f = .25) were recruited. Their average age was 21.09 (SD
(1-β) p
= 1.12). In this experimental stage, we manipulated the lumens contrast of the black-and-white
pattern mask. Sixty fearful, sad and neutral faces, and one-hundred-eighty Gaussian blurs were
presented. The stimuli were presented for 16.67 ms. They were presented in three sessions
involving twenty fearful. sad and neutral faces, and sixty blurs each with a 5-minutes break
between each session and order of sessions randomised. All the faces were averaged for
luminescence in SHINE, MATLAB (M = 140; SD = 23.08). In one session, the faces
overall average
were masked with a high lumens black-and-white pattern mask (M = 160; SD = 27.03), in one
session, they were masked with a mid-lumens mask (M = 140; SD = 27.03), and in one session,
they were masked with a low-lumens mask (M = 120; SD = 27.03). One second after each
presentation in each session, participants were asked “Did you see a face (Y/N)”. After that
task participants were asked to rate from “1” (not at all) to “9” (extremely) their confidence for
their response.
Significant differences were shown among sessions for Detection Performance (F (2,
2 2
118) = 1168.73; p < .001; η = .95) and Type of Emotion (F (2, 118) = 16.26; p < .001; η =
p p
.22), and a significant Detection Performance by Emotion Interaction was also reported (F (4,
236) = 3.21; p = .01; η = .05). Further Bonferroni corrected comparisons showed that the low
lumens session (M = .73; SD = .04) was higher for sensitivity index A than the high (M = .71;
SD = .03; p < .001; d = .57) and mid lumens sessions (M = .54; SD = .02; p < .001; d = 7.45).
The high lumens sessions was also higher than the mid lumens session (p < .001; d = 5.38).
For confidence ratings, significant differences were shown between sessions for Detection
Performance (F (2, 118) = 2489.81; p < .001; η = .97) Type of Emotion (F (2, 118) = 13.75;
p < .001; η < .19), and a Detection Performance by Emotion Interaction was also revealed (F
(4, 236) = 14.4; p < .001; η <. 19). Further Bonferroni corrected comparisons showed that the
low lumens session (M = 8.03; SD = .59) was higher for confidence ratings than the high (M
= 7.12; SD = .37; p < .001; d = 1.85) and mid lumens sessions (M = 4.79; SD = .36; p < .001;
d = 6.63). The high lumens sessions was also higher than the mid lumens session (p < .001; d
= 6.38). These results suggested that the lumens level of the mask influenced detection
performance and confidence for detection (see also Appendix 2A & 2B).
Psychophysics and Image Processing: Empirical Illustration, Part IΙΙ
In a third experimental pilot, a total of 60 undergraduate psychology students (31
female) (P ≥ .9; p ≤ .05; η = .06; f = .25) were recruited. Their average age was 22.21 (SD
(1-β) p
= 1.95). In this experimental stage, we initially wanted to explore if our previous findings were
due to session order effects because even session randomisation is not absolutely impenetrable
to response biases (Wiers, Boffo & Field, 2018). We repeated the designs described above this
time after averaging in SHINE, MATLAB the masks at mid lumens (M = 140; SD = 27.03)
and all the faces at mid lumens (M = 140; SD = 23.02). The participants engaged in
overall average
three same-day sessions with a 5-minutes break between sessions and including only matched
for lumens among stimulus types masked faces, matched for lumens masks and, therefore, no
lumens contrast between mask and masked stimuli in each session. The design was in all other
respects identical with experimental pilots one and two.
No significant differences and Bayesian evidence for equivalence of significance were
revealed among sessions for detection performance (F (2, 118) = .59; p = .66; η < .01; SE =
.007; BF = .31) and confidence ratings (F (2, 118) = .29; p = .75; η < .01; SE = .07; BF = .26).
No other significant results were reported for comparisons among Types of Emotion, and
Types of Emotion and Session Order interactions for detection (F (2, 118) = .183; p = .165; η
= .03; SE = .008; BF = 1.92) (F (4, 236) = .564; p < .001; η < .01; SE = .01; BF = .29) and
confidence ratings (F (2, 118) = .001; p = .99; η < .001; SE = .08; BF = .03) (F (4, 236) = .41;
p = .8; η < .01; SE = .12; BF = .13). The critical outcome of this experimental pilot was that
the detection performance overall across all three sessions (M = .511; SD = .977; SE = .012)
brought us a breath away from Bayesian evidence for the null (BF = .34), signifying that the
participants were overall marginally unconscious of the presented faces. This result extended
to sad (M = .505; SD = .989; SE = .013; BF = .05) and neutral faces (M = .508; SD = .998; SE
= .013; BF = .06). It was reduced for fearful faces (M = .521; SD = .99; SE = .014; BF = .9).
These outcomes were the closest we came till now for reporting unbiased Bayesian evidence
for unconsciousness throughout the entire set of our presented pilot studies.
Learnings and Limitations
In the last empirical illustration we came very close to providing unbiased evidence for
unconscious presentation. We were able to approximate Bayesian evidence for the null using
sensitivity index A, because the mean luminosity between the presented masked faces, the
presented masks and the mask-to-masked stimuli contrast were manipulated to equivalence
report a very proximate overall score for Bayesian evidence for the null, and substantial
evidence for the null for sad and neutral faces. We applied all the aforementioned resolutions
and advances we previously discussed in this manuscript and we, indeed, came – using, no less,
static durations of presentation (see Tsikandilakis & Chapman, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Chapman
& Peirce, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss
& Chapman, 2020a; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Yu, Madan, Derrfuss, Chapman & Groeger, 2021) –

of their psychophysics characteristics. Face stimuli, mask stimuli and masked-facial to masking-pattern difference combinations of

in the presentation of masked faces and masking patterns.
We failed to achieve unbiased evidence for unconscious presentation for fearful faces.
The answer as to why could be deferred to evolutionary psychology (Öhman & Mineka, 2001;
Schultz & Helmstetter, 2010; Sevenster, Beckers, & Kindt, 2014; Weike, Schupp & Hamm,
2007) supported incidentally in this case by the findings in our own previous work
(Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2020b; 2020c; Tsikandilakis et al., 2021;
Tsikandilakis et al., 2021). The perception of fearful faces is more acute because it arguably
confers increased evolutionary survival value. Fearful expressions signify via an interpersonal
proxy the unseen presence of an imminent threat in our immediate environment (Öhman,
2009).
Therefore, presented for the same brief duration (i.e., 16.67 ms), fearful faces were
perceived more accurately than less evolutionary important stimulus types (i.e., sad and neutral
faces; see Hedger, Adams & Garner, 2015). This is a viable argument. Our team has provided
empirical evidence that could be interpreted to support this argument in multiple publications
(Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2020a; 2020b; Tsikandilakis et al., 2021;
Tsikandilakis et al., 2021), other research groups have provided empirical evidence that could
be interpreted to support this interpretation in multiple publications (Etkin, Klemenhagen,
Dudman, Rogan, Hen, Kandel & Hirsch 2004; Stein, Peelen, Funk & Seidl, 2010; Wieser &
Keil, 2014; Hedger, Adams & Garner, 2015; Wang et al., 2017; Stein, Utz, & Van Opstal,
2020). Nevertheless, this thesis cannot be directly proven empirically (Workman & Reader,
2021). It can only be inferred as a theoretical interpretation from supporting empirical findings
(for a comprehensive review concerning the limitations of evolutionary interpretations, see
Hagen, 2005).
There is something that can be illustrated directly (Gray, Adams, Hedger, Newton &
Garner, 2013). The careful reader will have noticed that depending on the occasion, throughout
our manuscript, we presented the standard deviation for luminosity either as a fixed value or
an overall aggregate. We did so because in the case of pattern masks the same image was
repeated and, therefore, the same standard deviation applied for lumens values. In the case of
masked faces, different faces of the same and different emotional type involved differences in
the distribution of luminosity (see Sarantakos, 1998). That occurred because the distribution of
luminosity is a high-level visual component that varies for each face and contributes to the
structure of the presented face and contributes to the structure of emotional facial
characteristics (see De Gardelle & Kouider, 2010; Izmailov, Chernorizov & Polyansky, 2022;
see Figures 5 & 6).
We cannot change that the standard deviation of facial images will differ and will be
processed differently by the optical nerve, the optical thalamus and the occipital cortex (see
Sarantakos, 1998; see also De Gardelle & Kouider, 2010). If we do change them, the result will
contributes to the structure of the presented face that confers emotional information (Wyart &
Tallon-Baudry, 2009; Spillmann & Werner, 2012; Izmailov, Chernorizov & Polyansky, 2022).
That means that even if we achieve “Equivalence of Contrast” of the mean luminescence
between faces and masks, we cannot achieve “Equivalence of Contrast” of the distribution of
luminescence between faces and masks without changing faces to non-facial patterns.
We could not bring fearful faces to Bayesian evidence for the null because they have
properties related to the distribution and structure of facial characteristics that convey emotion
that make them potentially more perceptible than other stimulus types under conditions of
visual suppression (see Tsikandilakis & Chapman, 2018). We do not wish to enter an
Aristotelian – or worse, yet Kafkian – loop concerning whether the higher-level diversity
characteristics of fearful faces are due to their evolutionary significance or whether
evolutionary significance is a conceptual interpretation of high-level visual characteristics (see
Murphy & Zajonc, 1993).
Fearful faces – as do other kinds of emotional faces (Kihlstrom, Mulvaney, Tobias &
Tobis, 2000) – have distinct high-level characteristics that make them more perceptible than
other emotional types, such as sad and neutral faces (Liddell et al., 2005). Inconveniently, there
is very little we can do about this issue except employ our previously applied method for
individual unconsciousness (see Tsikandilakis & Chapman, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Chapman &
Peirce, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss &
Chapman, 2020a; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Yu, Madan, Derrfuss, Chapman & Groeger, 2021).
Doing this will take us in a very different place that we currently stand using static durations
of presentation, and it is important to submit a learning: There will not always necessarily be a
“grail” answer to our experimental questions (Oatley, 1992). There will frequently be issues,
concerns and hurdles, that are pending hard work for resolution or that may even not have one;
this is a reality with which we must make both peace and war in experimental research into the
unconscious. The coding scripts (including tutorial information) for this section, including DFT

components of facial images and form the recognizable structure of facial stimuli. Lines within inbox lateral
presentations show the distribution of the images in lumens and, therefore, the reception of high-level
characteristics from the optic nerve to the visual thalamus and the occipital cortex (Shapley,1990; see also Wyart
& Tallon-Baudry, 2009; Spillmann & Werner, 2012; Izmailov, Chernorizov & Polyansky, 2022). These
distribution/structural characteristics cannot be processed to equivalence between faces without disrupting the
structure of emotional expressions (De Gardelle & Kouider, 2010). Stimuli with the lowest measures of dispersion
Appeals and Considerations
In this manuscript we discoursed several problems relating to backward masking using
faces. These included the metrics for assessing perception, the statistical analyses for assessing
perception and contemporary psychophysics issues relating to backward masking. We
discoursed the resolutions for these problem, such as signal detection theory metrics, Bayesian
analysis and image processing techniques. We provided ready-to-use open-source code,
resources and software for these resolution. We presented a problem in visual processing and
psychophysics, relating to the inequivalence of contrast distribution for fearful faces, that we
could not resolve without redirecting the entire manuscript to a different approach for backward
masking (see for example Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2020a; Tsikandilakis,
Bali, Yu, Madan, Derrfuss, Chapman & Groeger, 2021; Tsikandilakis et al., 2022b).
We presented an argument for and empirically illustrated that hit-rates can be biased
and supplied the reader with easy-to-use dedicated software resources for employing unbiased
receiver operating characteristics (Stanislaw & Todorov, 1999; Zhang, & Mueller, 2005; see
discoursed that significance testing cannot provide direct evidence for the unconscious
presentation of facial stimuli (Rouder, Morey, Speckman & Pratte, 2007; Kruschke, J. K., &
Liddell, 2018; Kruschke, 2011; Rouder, Haaf & Vandekerckhove, 2018). Furthermore, we
showed and provided the reader with dedicated, easy-to-use and open-source software-
resources for conducting Bayesian analysis that can provide direct evidence for whether the
participants were unconscious of backward masked emotional faces (Dienes, 2014; 2015;
psychophysics can bring us close to unbiased evidence for unconsciousness, and, on the other
hand, that the high-level components of fearful faces, such as the distribution of luminosity in
emotional faces, is – until now (see Wyart & Tallon-Baudry, 2009; Spillmann & Werner, 2012;
Izmailov, Chernorizov & Polyansky, 2022) – not within our ability for further processing
towards achieving unbiased evidence for unconsciousness (De Gardelle & Kouider, 2010;
We presented these in an atypical and almost antithetical format to topical publications.
We chose this prosody and this format because we actively wanted to communicate the
alarming contrast between what re considered to be known and established issues and
resolutions, and the lack of their application and applied awareness of these issues and
resolutions in topical research, and what, therefore, we should be conscious when doing
unconscious research using backward masking of faces. We summoned the reader – as
Heraclitus wrote 2,500 years ago – to topical philosophical re-awakening and awareness (see
Axelrod, Bar & Rees, 2015; Kihlstrom, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman,
2020a; Brick et al., 2022). This was the overarching aim of the current manuscript: to argue
that conceptual discourse and methodological re-conceptualizations are truly important and
potentially more contributing to remaining static between outcomes for unconscious processing
and their refutations (see Agarwal, 2021).
Despite the controversial lineage in this area, the publication reality in this topic is that
“there is no bad publicity” (Hassin, Uleman & Bargh, 2004; Franks, 2010; Greenwald &
Banaji, 2017; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019). Outcomes for unconsciousness
or subconsciousness or subliminal processing, and their refutations are as “glittering” now as
they ever were (Albarrak, Metatla & Roudaut, 2020; Amd & Passarelli, 2020; Lapate et al.,
2020; Tu et al., 2020; Tsikandilakis et al., 2021; Tsikandilakis et al., 2022a). We can proceed
to provide – as provocatively as this thesis can be explicitly stated – career-advancing
publications, or we can strive to offer science-advancing publications and resolutions (see for
example Sandberg, Del Pin, Overgaard & Bibby, 2022). We undertook the arduous task of
providing the current revisit of conceptual discourses, several empirical illustrations and a host
of ready-to-use open-source code and software resolutions for a host of topical issues because
we believe in advancement over adversity.
Many issues and resolutions discoursed in this manuscript are known. They are
frequently not applied (van den Bussche, Van den Noortgate & Reynvoet, 2009; Brooks et al.,
2012; Meneguzzo, Tsakiris, Schioth, Stein & Brooks, 2014; van der Ploeg, Brosschot, Versluis
& Verkuil, 2017; Mertens & Engelhard, 2020). The distance among knowing established issues
and resolutions, and the lack of their application in relevant research should be a pedagogical
learning for all of us (Bargh, 2017; Weinberger & Stoycheva, 2019). Not applying the
resolutions of known issues can lead to bias. Applying them without proper scholarly and
methodological awareness reduces bias but will not lead to scientific advancement. Applying
them with proper scholarly and methodological awareness is the foundation for undertaking
and advancing topical research. In simple words, we do, indeed, need to be – or become –
conscious of what we are doing, when we are doing unconscious research (Bornstein, 1989;
Theus, 1994; Erdelyi, 2004; Pessoa & Adolphs, 2010; Wyer & Srull, 2014; van der Ploeg,
Brosschot, Versluis & Verkuil, 2017; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019; Vadillo
et al., 2020).
Summary of Conclusions
In this manuscript, we revisited part of the history of the concept of the unconscious,
the issues and resolutions of contemporary research using practical illustrations and offered
ready-to-use open-source resources to address issues that have been characterized as
problematic in backward masking using faces. We discussed the current need for this
reminding and discussed that applied awareness and further methodological developments are
of the essence. The overarching aim of the current manuscript was to make the reader conscious
of issues related to unconsciousness research, offer potential resolutions, and most critically,
to remind us that applying the methodological advances, and advancing the scientific
methodology in topical research are seminal.
