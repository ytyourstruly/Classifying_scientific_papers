Abstract
Mathematics achievement is an important predictor of later life and career prospects. Therefore, it is highly relevant to
identify early determinants of math achievement. Recently, non-cognitive aspects such as home learning environment
(home numeracy) and math anxiety were observed to significantly predict mathematics achievement beyond domain-
specific early numerical skills. However, these aspects have hardly been considered jointly in one study. Therefore, this
longitudinal study evaluated the predictive power of early numeracy skills, home learning environment, and math anxiety
assessed at the end of kindergarten for mathematics achievement at the beginning of second grade in a normative sample
of 85 children. Correlations and regression analyses indicated that early numeracy skills, home environment, and math
anxiety have a unique and essential influence on math school achievement. It is, however, important to note that predictions
seemed selective for different components of math achievement such as written computation, sequences, and comparisons.
Results indicated that home numeracy only predicted performance on sequences, whereas math anxiety seemed to affect
written computation. Overall achievement as well as performance on the equation’s subtest were best predicted by early
numeracy skills. Taken together, these results suggest that non-cognitive aspects of home numeracy and math anxiety
significantly influence children’s future math achievement. Importantly, however, results also argue for selective influences
that should be considered in future studies.

Foundations for Future Math Achievement
1 Introduction
Math achievement is crucial not only for scholastic attainment but also for everyday and professional life prospects
(Martin, 2018; Geary, 2000). In addition, the continuous further development of technology requires good math skills
(Swanson & Kim, 2007). Therefore, it is essential to better understand the determinants of math development. The
development of math skills begins early in life. It is influenced by factors such as home environment, parenting style, the
child’s interests, feelings and attitudes, and innate and learned abilities (see Gilmore, Göbel, & Inglis, 2018, for a review).
Numerous studies on the influence of these variables on math development have been published in recent years,
specifically addressing predictors of math performance and development, including cognitive skills such as early
numeracy skills (De Smedt, Verschaffel, & Ghesquière, 2009; Passolunghi, Mammarella, & Altoè, 2008), feelings such
as math anxiety (Krinzinger, Kaufmann, & Willmes, 2009; Kucian et al., 2018), or home environment factors such as
home numeracy (Blevins-Knabe & Musun-Miller, 1996; Skwarchuk, Sowinski, & LeFevre, 2014). Finally, cognitive
abilities—such as working memory—are the most robust predictor for math learning (Allen et al., 2020; Bisagno et al.,
2023; Geary et al., 2017).
All the aforementioned predictors are significantly related to math achievement and essential for math
development. Thus far, the contributions of these factors have been studied in isolation rather than jointly (exceptions are
the symbolic and non-symbolic skills which have been studied together, see below). The contribution of the present
longitudinal study is that it aims to consider the joint influences of early numeracy skills, home numeracy, and math
anxiety assessed in kindergarten on later second-grade math achievement, while controlling for working memory.
Certainly, these are not the only factors that influence mathematics achievements. They were selected due to their
prominence in the existing literature, and because these factors provide multiple, diverse perspectives on mathematics
learning and development. Namely, the inclusion of early numeracy skills and working memory tell us something about
the role of children’s innate capacity on math achievement. If we think of early numeracy skills and working memory as
standing in for “nature” in nature-nurture debate, then investigating home numeracy, in contrast, provides a view into the
role of “nurture.” Finally, the inclusion of mathematics anxiety can provide insight into the affective side of mathematics
learning and development. In the following, we will give an overview of previous research regarding early numeracy
skills, home learning environment and home numeracy, math anxiety, and the relationship between those constructs and
math achievement.
Children can demonstrate intuitive early numeracy skills at an early stage, such as processing small numerosities
to count or establishing first numerical relationships even before they enter preschool (Rousselle & Noël, 2007). In later
development, early numeracy skills serve as building blocks for acquiring basic arithmetic and other more advanced math
skills (see Krajewski & Schneider, 2009 for a developmental model of early numerical skills). Early numeracy skills are
often investigated by tasks requiring children to compare magnitudes or quantities (Durand, Hulme, Larkin, & Snowling,
2005) or number line estimation (i.e., indicating the spatial position of a number on a given number line). These tasks can
be carried out in symbolic (using Arabic digits; Siegler & Booth, 2004; Siegler & Opfer, 2003) but also in non-symbolic
format (using dot patterns or sets of other objects; Kolkman, Kroesbergen, & Leseman, 2013) or require the mapping of
one format onto the other (e.g., conceptual subitizing; Benz, 2014; Steffe & Cobb, 1988). Importantly, such early
numeracy skills are strong predictors of later mathematics achievement longitudinally (Aunola, Leskinen, Lerkkanen, &
Early Numeracy, Home Learning, and the Absence of Math Anxiety
Nurmi, 2004; Krajewski & Schneider, 2009; Jordan, Kaplan, Ramineni, & Locuniak, 2009; Passolunghi, Vercelloni, &
Schadee, 2007), directly (Geary, Hoard, Nugent, & Bailey, 2013; Mazzocco, Feigenson, & Halberda, 2011) and indirectly
(Jordan, Glutting, Dyson, Hassinger-Das, & Irwin, 2012).
Of course, early numeracy skills develop in a context. Research suggests that children’s home learning
environment plays a decisive role in cognitive development in general and numerical development in particular—
especially in early childhood (e.g., Zhao, et al., 2014; Zippert & Rittle-Johnson, 2018). Home Numeracy Environment is
defined as the mathematics-specific learning environment at home, comprising of family activities including numbers,
quantities, and measurements; more broadly, home numeracy environment includes attitudes towards mathematics and
model behavior of parents (Niklas & Schneider, 2012, Pezdek, Berry, & Renno, 2002). The frequency of such numerical
activities within a family appears to be positively related to children’s math skills (Blevins-Knabe & Musun-Miller,
1996). Similarly, children’s prior numerical knowledge in kindergarten is positively related to the numerical learning
environment (LeFevre, Polyzoi, Skwarchuk, Fast, & Sowinski, 2010). Additionally, a recent intervention study indicated
that enriching the numerical home learning environment improved early numeracy skills in preschoolers (Niklas,
Cohrssen, & Tayler, 2015).
Within the field of research on home learning, a distinction is sometimes made between a formal home learning
environment (i.e., Formal HLE) and an informal home learning environment (Informal HLE; LeFevre et al., 2009;
LeFevre et al., 2010). Formal HLE consists of activities that specifically target early numeracy skills such as counting or
magnitude understanding, which were observed to underlie later math development (LeFevre et al., 2009) by the
frequency being predictive for children’s growth of math skills (Susperreguy et al., 2021; Skwarchuk, Sowinski, &
LeFevre, 2014) and even after controlling for children’s numerical skills at baseline (see Mutaf-Yıldız et al., 2020, for a
review). Informal HLE, however, includes activities such as playing games requiring the processing of numbers (e.g.,
through using dice) or involving a numerical strategy, thus indirectly targeting numerical learning (LeFevre et al., 2009).
Informal HLE has been shown to predict non-symbolic numeracy skills (e.g., Skwarchuk, Sowinski, & LeFevre, 2014),
arithmetic fluency, and math achievement more generally in kindergarten, first, and second year of primary school
(LeFevre et al., 2009). However, a recent meta-analysis found that although the effects are positive, they remain small
(Cohen’s d = 0.18; Cahoon et al., 2022).
In addition to more cognitive and environmental factors, we wished to account for the role of affect in math
learning and development. Interest in math anxiety has increased in the last 30 years (Ashcraft & Faust, 1994, Hopko,
Ashcraft, Gute, Ruggiero, & Lewis, 1998; for a summary, see Cipora, Santos, Kucian, & Dowker, 2022). Math anxiety is
tension when a person is in a numerical context. It leads to avoidance of numerical/math activities, which in the long run
further increases math anxiety to peak in high school years (Hembree, 1990). In severe cases, it has been shown to lead to
failure or school phobia accompanied by psychosomatic complaints (Ashraft, 2002; Dowker, 2005). Likewise, math
anxiety was observed to harm math achievement, not only because of avoidance but also because anxiety-related thoughts
block attention and working memory capacities. Thus, cognitive resources for math processing are reduced (Ashcraft &
Kirk, 2001; Dowker, Sarkar, & Looi, 2016). This negative influence was found in different outcome measures such as
processing of numerical magnitudes (Maloney, Ansari, and Fugelsang, 2011; Núñez-Peña & Suárez-Pellicioni, 2014)
calculation and math fluency skills (Ashcraft & Moore, 2009; Legg & Locker, 2009; Wu, Barth, Amin, Malcarne, and
Foundations for Future Math Achievement
Menon, 2012), grades (Karimi & Venkatesan, 2009), but also performance in standardized math tests (Foley et al., 2017;
Lee, 2009), as well as engagement with math (Anson, 2021). Although it was believed that children remain unaffected
by their academic beliefs and attitudes (Wigfield et al., 1997), in part because children are typically overly optimistic
about their performance (Destan & Roebers, 2015; Metcalfe & Finn, 2013), recent research demonstrated that math
anxiety may be present as early as first grade (Ramirez, Gunderson, Levine, & Beilock, 2013).
Early numeracy and home numeracy positively influence the development of math skills—in contrast, math
anxiety negatively influences math skills development. Since these factors were considered in isolation in previous
research, it is hard to evaluate potential selective influences of these factors on math achievement in general or on
subdimensions (e.g., arithmetic) of math achievement. Because these factors interact in everyday life, the present
longitudinal study considered influences of early numeracy skills, home numeracy, and math anxiety on children’s
development of math skills. To do so, 85 children were followed from kindergarten to 2nd grade. Moreover, as math
achievement is a multidimensional concept and the chosen predictive factors were observed to correlate selectively with
different subdimension (e.g., Haffner, Baro, Parzer & Resch, 2005; cf. Schillinger, Vogel, Diedrich, & Grabherr, 2018),
we evaluated influences of early numeracy skills, home numeracy, as well as math anxiety not only on math achievement
in general but also on the three sub-dimensions of i) written calculation, ii) sequences, and iii) comparisons. In all
analyses, we controlled for influences of working memory as an established domain-general predictor of mathematics
achievement (Ashcraft & Krause, 2007; Ramirez, Chang, Maloney, Levine, & Beilock, 2016).
The present study was exploratory. The statistical approach we used was Bayesian multi-model inference to
investigate which models, including which variables, are best predictors of math achievement and math achievement
subdimensions. We expected that previously shown positive predictors (mostly symbolic skills and informal home
numeracy) would be included in the model, and that math anxiety would be a negative predictor for math achievement.
As for the subdimensions we tentatively hypothesized that arithmetic skills would be most affected by math anxiety.
2 Method
2.1 Participants
The sample consisted of 85 children recruited from different kindergartens in rural and urban areas near Bern,
Switzerland. Most participating children were from middle to upper-middle-class families. For 69.2% of the participants,
the spoken language at home was German, 10% spoke other languages with both parents, and 12% were bilinguals
(information missing for 9% of children). However, all children were fluent enough in German to understand task
instructions. The sample’s mean age at time point 1 (henceforth T1) was M = 6.42 years (SD = 0.31 years), including 46
boys and 42 girls. There was no significant difference in age between boys (M = 6.46 years) and girls (M = 6.43 years, t
(156) = -.47, p = .54). At the second measurement time point (henceforth T2), mean age was M = 7.98 years (SD = 0.31
years). Data on all predictor variables were collected at the first time point, whereas on the second time, data on the
outcome variable of math achievement was collected. Written informed consent was obtained from parents, whereas oral
informed assent was obtained from children, the school directory, and teachers prior to the start of the study.
2.2 Measures
Early Numeracy, Home Learning, and the Absence of Math Anxiety
2.2.1 Early Numeracy Skills
Early numeracy skills in kindergarten were assessed using a number line estimation, a magnitude comparison, as well as
a conceptual subitizing task.
The computerized number line estimation task (the Number-to-Position version by Laski and Siegler, 2007, adapted by
Friso-van den Bos et al., 2014) was administered in a symbolic and a non-symbolic version. In the symbolic version,
children were asked to estimate the spatial location of 22 Arabic numbers on an otherwise empty number line ranging
from 1 to 100. For the non-symbolic version, a racing car was introduced—as a cover story—and filled with 22 different
numbers of drops of gasoline (reflecting 22 items as in the symbolic task version). Children were asked to point on the
line (which began at one drop and ended at 100 drops) how far the car would go with the respective number of drops of
gasoline. Each child's linear fit score (R2) indicated how closely their estimations matched a linear function on each task;
the scores ranged from 0 (no fit at all) to 1 (precisely linear).
In the magnitude comparison task (based on Laski and Siegler, 2007 and adapted by Friso-van den Bos et al.,
2014), children had to decide which one of two Arabic two-digit numbers presented on a laptop screen had the larger
magnitude. Children had to press either a left or a right external response button to indicate that the right or left Arabic
number was larger. The task started with six practice trials followed by 33 experimental trials, and the position of the
higher number was randomized. Overall comparison accuracy (in percent correctly solved items) was used as the
analysis's dependent variable.
Conceptual Subitizing was assessed using pictures of the faces of two different dice. Children had to tell the
number of points on both dice without counting them (adding the points on both dice up). They were asked to answer
verbally and as quickly as possible and to give only one answer. After their answer was given, the following picture was
shown. The task started with one practice trial followed by nine experimental trials. The reaction time of the task was z-
transformed and reversed (such that a higher number represents a higher performance) and used for the analysis.
2.2.2 Working Memory
We adapted the subtest Matrix from the Working Memory Test Battery for Children (WMTB-C; Pickering & Gathercole,
2001) for working memory. A four-by-four matrix was displayed on the screen to the children. During each trial, children
were asked to recall which matrix squares became black and retrieve the sequence in reverse order on a similar matrix. As
part of the experimental session, a span of two colored squares was used, and the level increased when at least four of the
six trials on each span were correctly recalled. The number of accurately solved trials was taken as a score for working
memory.
2.2.3 Math anxiety
Concern and sadness related to math events were assessed employing a German translation of the Mathematics Attitude
and Anxiety Questionnaire (Thomas & Dowker, 2000; FRA; Krinzinger et al., 2007). The internal consistency of these
tests varies between r = .65 and .85 depending on the different subscales for children in kindergarten, generally showing
good reliability (Thomas & Dowker, 2000; Krinzinger et al., 2007). Children were asked to give answers on a pictorial 5-
Foundations for Future Math Achievement
point scale (from 0 meaning not at all to 4 meaning very much) on four questions (covering the four scales of self-rating,
liking, anxiety, and sadness) concerning seven subsequent math-related situations, this means math in general,
written/mental calculations, easy/complex calculations, math homework, and listening and understanding during math
lessons. The scores for each question ranged from 0 to 4. Thus, for each scale from 0 to 28. Since the scales “concern”
and “sadness” are used to measure math anxiety, only the sum score of these two scales went into analysis.
2.2.4 Home Numeracy
Home numeracy was assessed using a German translation of the self-rating questionnaire from Skwarchuk et al. (2014)
with 58 items answered in writing by children’s parents at the first measurement. The answers to 13 questions identified
formal home numeracy, which reflects the direct promotion of math skills in the family. Parents had to specify how often
they accomplish several activities with numbers with their children. A sum score was computed across the 13 items and
used as a dependent variable in the analyses.
Reflecting informal home numeracy, indirect support in games with math content (e.g., using dice) was
identified by a list of 25 German games for 3- to 6-year-old children. The list included ten numerical games, ten non-
numerical games, and five fictional games (again, according to Skwarchuk et al. 2014). Parents had to indicate which
games they recognized from their own home or children without guessing and looking them up on the internet. The
dependent variable is calculated by subtracting the number of chosen fictitious games from the number of chosen real
numerical games, dividing by 10, and multiplying by 100, according to Skwarchuk and colleagues (2014).
2.2.5 Mathematics achievement
Mathematics achievement was assessed using three subtests of a standardized and curriculum-based paper and pencil test
(Heidelberger Rechentest, Haffner, Baro, Parzer & Resch, 2005). The group testing lasted for approximately 15 minutes.
The subtests used were i) comparisons, ii) sequences, and iii) written calculation. We chose these specific subtests
because of their content validity; they represent a typical selection from the spectrum of basic arithmetic operations and
equation tasks used in primary schools in German-speaking countries. Moreover, there is a high and specific agreement
with the school grade in mathematics (r = .67, see Haffner, Baro, Parzer & Resch, 2005). Thus, this battery and,
specifically, these subtests are widely used to assess math achievement in German-speaking countries.
In the comparisons, subtest children had to indicate whether a number or brief arithmetic term on the left side of
a page was <, =, or > than a number or term on the right side of the page by writing the respective sign in a prespecified
field. There were 40 items, and children had to solve as many items as possible within two minutes. An accuracy score
was computed according to the test manual by subtracting the number of erroneously solved trials from the number of
correctly solved ones and then dividing the result by 2.
In the sequences subtest, children had to find the math rule underlying a sequence of four numbers to continue
the respective sequence by three more numbers i.e., filling three blank spaces at the end of each trial or in other words
identifying and extending the logical relationship between numbers (e.g., “3 3 4 5 5 6 _ _ _”). The dependent variable
used in the analyses was the sum of correctly solved trials per the test manual.
Early Numeracy, Home Learning, and the Absence of Math Anxiety
In the written calculation subtest, children had to solve as many simple arithmetic problems as possible, including
additions and subtractions, taught in 2nd grade, within a time limit of two minutes and 30 seconds. Following the test
manual, the dependent variable was the sum of correctly solved items with a maximum score of 12.
2.3 Procedure
This study was part of a larger research project approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Bern, which
follows APA guidelines and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. At T1, at the end of the kindergarten year, all
tests were completed within two sessions lasting 45 minutes each. Computer-based tasks had to be completed
individually on a laptop (Lenovo 3000 N200 with a 15.4 WXGA screen, aspect ratio of 16:10, run at a resolution of 1280
x 800 pixels) located in a separate room. Children also completed the math anxiety questionnaire individually with the
experimenter in a separate room. After completing testing, children were rewarded with a small gift (e.g., a toy car, a
pencil, and similar). T2 took place 18 months after T1 when children were at the beginning of second grade. Mathematics
achievement was tested in classroom groups within a regular school hour. Again, participating children were rewarded
with a small gift upon completion. As scaling was not comparable across tasks, all variables were z-standardized prior to
analyses. A joint measure of symbolic and non-symbolic number line estimation was computed by adding the z-scores to
a sum score. Similarly, the overall mathematics achievement score was computed by summing up the subtests’ z-scores.
2.4 Data Analysis
According to our research questions and addressing our hypotheses, we statistically predicted math achievement and the
math achievement sub-scores (comparison, sequences, and written calculations) by early numeracy skills (symbolic, non-
symbolic, subitizing), home numeracy (informal and formal), and math anxiety. We performed Bayesian correlations to
explore the relations between the variables while expecting a relationship between the variables (alternative hypothesis).
We used Bayesian multi-model inference in JASP (2022) to perform regression analysis. We used this approach for the
following reasons: 1) Bayesian analyses do not depend on large samples, matching our sample size, 2) multi-model
inference retains all models and calculates weights for each model, which reflect how much the data support that model,
3) and accomplishes variable selection and parameter estimation simultaneously instead of sequentially (van den Bergh et
al., 2020). Although it is commonly used, inference from two-step methods leads to overestimating parameters (Burnham
& Anderson, 2003).

Since it is challenging to illustrate all models, model averaging was used. This way, the individual relevance of
predictors was quantified. To read the following tables 2-5, the first column denotes the predictor variable, followed by
‘mean’ and ‘SD,’ which represent the respective posterior mean and standard deviation of the parameter after model
averaging. 𝑃(incl) indicates the prior inclusion probability, and P(incl∣data) represents the posterior inclusion probability.
The Bayes factor (BFincl) stands for the change from prior to posterior inclusion odds, and the last two columns mark a

Foundations for Future Math Achievement
This longitudinal study aimed to evaluate the potentially selective prediction of math achievement in 7- to 8-year-old
children, considering influences of early numeracy skills, home learning environment, and math anxiety assessed when
the same children were 6- to 7-years old.
Previous research indicated that early numeracy skills were essential and robust predictors of later math
achievement even when controlling for influences of age, general intelligence, and working memory (e.g., ß = 0.287 in
Geary et al., 2013; r2 = .278 in Mazzocco et al., 2011). In this regard, early numeracy skills would again be identified as a
robust predictor in the present study. In line with previous evidence and our expectations, our results substantiated that
early numeracy skills assessed in 6-to-7-year old children (employing magnitude comparison, number line estimation,
and subitizing) were not only strongly correlated but also highly predictive of overall math achievement at 18 months
later when children were in second grade (Aunola et al., 2004; Passolunghi et al., 2007; Jordan et al., 2009; Krajewski &
Schneider, 2009, Fazio, Bailey, Thompson, & Siegler, 2014).
Furthermore, performance in the sub-dimensions number sequences and comparisons was predicted by symbolic
skills. In contrast, the sub-dimension written calculation was predicted by symbolic and non-symbolic skills and
conceptual subitizing. These results provide support for both sides of the ongoing controversy about when and how
symbolic and non-symbolic early numeracy skills contribute to later math achievement (e.g., Aragón, Canto-López,
Aguilar, Menacho, & Navarro, 2022; Reynvoet et al., 2021; Kolkman, Kroesbergen, & Leseman, 2013; for a review see
Nogues, & Dorneles, 2021). In sum, these results indicate that certain factors are only predictors for certain
subdimensions of math achievement (for similar findings, see Bull, Lee, & Muñez, 2021). Early numeracy skills are a
stable predictor of later mathematics achievement. Nevertheless, at a closer look, it is also the case that specific early
numeracy skills predict specific sub-dimensions of later math achievement.
The significant association with and prediction of the subdimension sequences by informal home numeracy
substantiated previous findings (e.g., LeFevre et al., 2009; Muñez, Bull, & Lee, 2021; Girard et al., 2022). This means
that numerical board or card games that children play at home seem helpful for later sequence knowledge or that children
with better sequence knowledge also engage more often in numerical card or board games. A possible explanation for this
specific association may be that numerical activities in games often involve processing sequences (e.g., children observe
a pattern and use it to predict the subsequent steps/numbers/actions in a game) that, in turn, help children obtain the
missing numbers in the sequence task. Identifying the rule with which the sequence continues was sometimes tricky and
may have challenged children similarly to games and quizzes. Moreover, the finding that numerical activities at home
predicted only a specific sub-dimension of mathematics achievement is in line with a recent study investigating the
association between home numeracy and early numeracy skills (Mutaf Yıldız, Sasanguie, De Smedt, & Reynvoet, 2018).
Nevertheless, home numeracy was positively related to early numeracy skills (confirming LeFevre, Polyzoi,
Skwarchuk, Fast, & Sowinski, 2010). In earlier studies, home numeracy predicts early numeracy skills (Niklas, Cohrssen,
& Tayler, 2015). Our results suggest that family activities are important learning possibilities and should be promoted
accordingly. Future research should investigate how children learn best in an incidental or playful manner and which
kinds of activities are the most effectful and least complex, and costly. Furthermore, future research should address if
children engage more in those games if they already have more developed numerical skills. Those research outcomes

might inform parents, practitioners, and teachers how to support children’s numeracy development more practically and
cost-effectively.
Math anxiety also proved to be an important negative influence on subcomponents of math achievement (written
computation), confirming previous findings (symbolic math; Li, Chen, & Zhou, 2022; Abu-Hilal, 2000; Krinzinger et al.,
2007; Ramirez, Chang, Maloney, Levine, & Beilock, 2016). This finding is twofold. An optimistic interpretation of this
finding is that although math anxiety does affect a subcomponent of math achievement, it does not (yet) have a
detrimental effect on overall math achievement. Previous studies believed that math anxiety is only experienced after 2nd
grade (Ashcraft & Faust, 1994; Hopko et al.,1998). On top of that, children between the ages of six and nine tend to give
more positive responses, leading to fewer verbal reports of sadness and worry (Krinzinger, Kaufmann, & Willmes, 2009).
Possibly, math anxiety has been overlooked in the past as it only shows evidence in our study for one sub-dimension.
Although the study of math anxiety in kindergarteners and early primary school children is still young, our study shows
that it is essential to focus on this emotional construct and emphasize its importance concerning early mathematics
performance. Even though kindergarteners and early primary school children report less negative and generally more
positive feelings about their skills and achievement, our study showed that written computation is influenced negatively
by math anxiety. This question is as follows: Why does math anxiety influence written computation? What kind of
support can be offered to affected children—early on—so they do not get into the vicious cycle of disengaging and
therefore missing opportunities to increase their knowledge and skills in mathematics (Anson, 2021)? Since this is one
factor influencing career decisions (Ashcraft, 2002), the potential beneficiary effects of STEM participation in this field
of research should not be underestimated. For a more detailed discussion about research in math anxiety, see the work of
Cipora, Santos, Kucian, & Dowker (2022).
Surprisingly, although one might expect that a home learning environment would protect against math anxiety,
the two factors did not correlate negatively (nor positively). These relations might not be seen in the present study
because of the long (18 months) gap between the two measurement points. There might have been processes we could not
capture because the children's behavior might have been changing drastically between the two measurements. Thus, more
research is needed regarding math anxiety and the home learning environment, and it might address whether the home
learning environment has a protective power on math anxiety longitudinally, using a more in-depth analysis of the
relationship between them while it is changing through a micro genetic study design.
The present findings are of practical importance for typical and atypical development and for mathematics
education. Since individual differences in early numeracy skills and math anxiety are relevant to a child's math
achievement, children with poor early numeracy skills or a high rate of math anxiety could be at risk for developing math
learning difficulties or math avoidance behavior. A home learning environment or at least an informal learning
environment can be considered a possible intervention to promote essential skills and to allow early access to the
numerical world, which is playful for children, cheerful, more accessible to learn, and more attractive. Furthermore, the
relationship between math achievement and the numerical learning environment allows parents to support their children's
interest in numbers and magnitudes at home with appropriate games. The increased numerical understanding can be
gained early using the enriched numerical learning environment (Niklas et al., 2015; LeFevre et al., 2010). However, this
also depends on the ability and willingness of the parents. Teachers and educators should consider using a variety of
Foundations for Future Math Achievement
mathematical representations (symbolic, non-symbolic, or a combination of both) to teach mathematics knowledge to
reduce math anxiety and increase math achievement. Using situational, playful, and verbal representations of math can
assist young children in learning while maintaining low levels of math anxiety.
Since the investigated variables are only some of the ones involved in the development of math cognition, future
research, including additional, diverse concepts, is needed. The self-concept decreases with more realistic assessments of
one's abilities and the increase in social comparison (Helmke, 1998, Marsh, Craven, & Debus, 1998). Therefore, the
influence of math anxiety increases during elementary school. This shows the need for longitudinal studies investigating
math anxiety, early numeracy skills, home learning environment, school achievement, and self-concept throughout
elementary school.
A limitation of the study is its sample size: it needed to be bigger to use more sophisticated models to explain the
effects of the predictors or compare specific trajectories with each other. Another limitation is that the children were only
followed for 18 months and that there are only two measurement points. Future studies should include more children,
follow them for extended periods, and assess their skills at least three times.
In summary, there is moderate to strong evidence that math anxiety, home learning environment, and early
numeracy skills in 6- to 7-year-olds predict their math achievement 18 months later. This study has made an additional
contribution by simultaneously investigating relevant factors for developing mathematical skills. Playful activities with
indirect reference to numbers and magnitudes may be interventional support for improving preschool math skills and later
math achievement.
