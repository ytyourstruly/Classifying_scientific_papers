Abstract
In episodic memory studies, memory performance is often assessed by presenting
participants with previously seen old items and previously unseen new items in
order to assess both, subjects’ hit rates and false alarms. Sometimes, subsequent
memory responses are collected as recognition-confidence ratings, e.g. on a scale
ranging from “definitely new” over “undecided” to “definitely old”. Despite higher
informational value, this is problematic, as it conflates recognition (i.e. one rather
than the other end of the scale) with confidence (i.e. outer rather than inner area
of the scale). Here, we describe a computational model which separates three
cognitive processes of episodic memory retrieval from reported
recognition-confidence ratings, namely (i) decidedness, i.e. the tendency to give a
neutral or non-neutral response; (ii) recognition, i.e. the ability to label previously
seen items as “old”; and (iii) confidence, i.e. the act of labeling an item as
“definitely” rather than “probably” old or new. We empirically validate our model
by recovering memory-related differences between young and older adults
(N = 106 + 153 = 259), especially the over-confidence phenomenon in older adults
as well as superior memory performance and meta-cognitive accuracy for young
adults. Interestingly, we find that decidedness does not vary between old vs. new
items and young vs. older subjects, thus constituting a third process distinct from
recognition and confidence.

1 Introduction
Episodic memory, the ability to form memory traces from single events in their spatial
and temporal context, is crucial for human decision-making and appropriate behavior
(Tulving, 1985). Episodic memory performance peaks in young adulthood and declines
with increasing age, with older adults showing considerably lower memory performance
(Craik and Simon, 1980; Rönnlund et al., 2005; Clark et al., 2018; Cabeza et al., 2018).
Memory performance is frequently investigated with recognition memory tests in which
participants are required to make an old/new decision on a set of stimuli consisting of
some that were presented during an encoding phase (“old”) and others that were not
(“new”) (Richardson-Klavehn and Bjork, 1988; Richardson-Klavehn, 2010).
Sometimes, this approach is combined with confidence ratings, for example, an old/new
decision followed by a confidence assessment on a bipolar rating scale (Tekin and Roediger,
2017). A special form of this combination is represented by recognition-confidence scales
on which participants rate stimulus oldness and response confidence at the same time
(e.g. Yonelinas, 2005; Düzel et al., 2010). Within the signal detection theory framework,
confidence judgments for recognition ratings are thought to be reached in the same way
as the old/new decision (Hautus et al., 2021), such that a single underlying process is
assumed (Stretch and Wixted, 1998). A combined recognition confidence rating is then
interpreted as one measure of memory strength indicating, for example, the degree of
familiarity (Yonelinas et al., 2010; Diana et al., 2010).
The assumption that confidence and accuracy in recognition memory are based on a
single process is highly problematic, because there is convincing evidence from
psychology and cognitive neuroscience studies against this view. Although confidence
and accuracy are typically correlated, certain effects of encoding instructions or memory
test manipulations can only be explained by assuming two distinct processes or sources
of information (Busey et al., 2000; Van Zandt, 2000). Moreover, although studies
employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown partially
overlapping neural networks for accuracy and confidence, there are differences between
high- vs. low-confidence-related brain activity, independent of true or false recognition
(Kim and Cabeza, 2007). Finally, confidence is typically regarded as a meta-cognitive
process whereas recognition is not (Luttrell et al., 2013).
We therefore advocate that combined recognition-confidence ratings in episodic memory
retrieval convey two distinct pieces of information, namely whether the subject
recognizes the item (responses at the “old” rather than “new” end of the scale) and
whether the subject is confident in their response (extreme rather than moderate
responses on either end of the scale). Together, recognition and confidence judgments
also inform about meta-cognitive accuracy. Meta-cognition refers to conscious internal
monitoring processes, i.e. thinking about thinking (Flavell, 1979), and meta-cognitive
accuracy describes the correctness of the meta-cognitive judgement, which here would
be reflected by an agreement of the confidence with the recognition judgement.
When considering differences in episodic memory performance across the lifespan, there
is evidence showing that older adults are less accurate than younger adults in
recognition-confidence judgements (Jacoby and Rhodes, 2006; Wong et al., 2012). In
their study, Wong and colleagues investigated whether this age effect reflects
age-related reductions in recollection ability (in line with the single-process theory of
recognition-confidence ratings) or whether it instead reflects impaired meta-cognitive
abilities (supporting a two-process model of subsequent memory responses). The
authors found high positive correlations between confidence judgements and recognition
accuracy. However, they also observed age-related impairment in meta-memory
accuracy when controlling for recognition accuracy differences (Wong et al., 2012). This
suggests that there are not only overlaps, but also distinctions in the neural processes
underlying confidence and recognition judgements.
Interestingly, not only does episodic memory performance decline with increasing age,
but older adults commit memory errors with higher confidence than young adults or also
children (Shing et al., 2009). This suggests age-dependent differences not only in the
cognitive processes and neural substrates of episodic memory, but also in the processes
underlying decision confidence. Age differences in meta-cognitive performance are further
supported by evidence showing that older adults exhibit lower accuracy due to a more
liberal report criterion in combination with less eﬀicient memory monitoring (Pansky
et al., 2009). Jacoby and Rhodes proposed a framework for explaining this high proneness
of older adults for false memories with high confidence, suggesting that this phenomenon
is due to a decreased ability in the conscious control of memory retrieval which declines
with increasing age (Jacoby and Rhodes, 2006).
To summarize, evidence suggests that older adults not only show a decline in memory
performance, but also an increased tendency to commit high-confidence false alarms.
This and the dissociative behavioral and neural correlates of confidence and recognition
suggest that recognition-confidence rating scales do not reflect one, but at least two
separate cognitive processes.
In this work, we describe a new computational model for recognition-confidence ratings
which not only separates recognition and confidence, but also introduces a third process
in episodic memory retrieval, the tendency of a subject to give a non-neutral response at
all. This process, here termed “decidedness”, or rather its inverse “undecidedness”, has
been previously known as “neutral response bias” (Budson et al., 2006; Beth et al., 2009)
or “midpoint response style” (Worthy, 1969; Hernández et al., 2004) and is sometimes
argued to simply reflect the lowest degree of confidence.
To identify the computational model best explaining measured recognition-confidence
ratings, we employ probabilistic modelling and Bayesian model selection across a large
set of candidate models. Given that an optimal model has been identified and its model
parameters have been estimated, this allows to calculate four measures describing different
aspects of memory behavior: the level of decidedness (LD); memory performance (MP);
level of confidence (LC); and meta-cognitive accuracy (MCA).
Applying our model to a large cohort of young and older adults (N = 106 + 153 =
259) who performed a visual incidental episodic memory encoding task, we establish
decidedness and confidence as in fact separate cognitive processes, in the sense that LD
and LC are distinct in terms of (i) differences between young and older adults and (ii) the
necessity to distinguish associated model parameters between old and new items. We find
that except for LD, all behavioral measures differ between age groups, with higher LC for
older adults, and young adults scoring higher on MP and MCA. Finally, LC is correlated
with all other measures in both age groups, indicating a central role of confidence for
episodic memory as well as meta-cognitive ability.
2 Methods
2.1 Participants
The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Otto von Guericke
University (OvGU) Magdeburg, Faculty of Medicine (protocol number: 33/15), and
written informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association, 2013).
In total, the study cohort consisted of 259 neurologically and psychiatrically healthy
adults, including 106 young (47 male, 59 female, age range 18-35, mean age 24.12 ± 4.00
years) and 153 older (59 male, 94 female, age range 51-80, mean age 64.04 ± 6.74 years)
participants. For detailed description of the study cohort, see Soch et al., 2021b; Soch
et al., 2021a; and Richter et al., 2022.
2.2 Memory encoding
Participants performed a visual memory encoding paradigm with an indoor/outdoor
judgment as the incidental encoding task (Düzel et al., 2010; Assmann et al., 2021; Soch
et al., 2021b; Soch et al., 2021a). Subjects viewed photographs showing indoor and
indoor and 44 outdoor scenes) or repetitions of two highly familiar “master” images (22
indoor and 22 outdoor trials), i.e. one indoor and one outdoor scene pre-familiarized
before the actual experiment. Thus, every subject was presented with 88 unique images
and 2 master images that were presented 22 times each. Participants were instructed to
categorize images as “indoor” or “outdoor” via button press. Each picture was presented
2.3 Memory retrieval
Approximately 70 minutes (70.23 ± 3.77 min) after the start of the encoding session,
participants performed a computer-based recognition memory test outside the scanner
during the encoding phase (“old items”) and 44 images they had not seen before (“new
items”). Participants rated each image on a five-point Likert scale (Likert, 1932) from 1
procedure, see Assmann et al., 2021; and Soch et al., 2021b.
2.4 Further data acquisition
These experiments were part of a larger study investigating the neural processes
underlying memory formation in the juvenile and in the aging brain (hence the
recruitment of young and older adults). During the memory encoding session, functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals were measured, with the goal of identifying
neural correlates of novelty processing and subsequent memory. The present paper
exclusively focuses on the behavioral data, using the model developed in Section 3. The
fMRI data have been and will be reported elsewhere (Soch et al., 2021b; Soch et al.,
2021a; Richter et al., 2022; Soch et al., 2022; Kizilirmak et al., 2022).

3 Modelling
3.1 Behavioral data
Assume that a subject has seen O items, e.g. words, pictures or other stimuli, in a memory
encoding phase. In a subsequent memory test, the subject is then presented with these O
“old” items as well as N “new” items they have not previously seen. Thus, in the retrieval
phase, the total number of trials is n = O + N . In our case, these numbers are O = 88,
N = 44 and n = 132.
∈ { }
Let x 1, 2 be a variable indicating that the i-th stimulus in retrieval was an old (1)
∈ { }
or a new (2) item and let y 1, . . . , L be a variable representing the subject’s memory
report in the i-th trial ranging from “sure new” (1) to “sure old” (L) where L is number
of levels on the Likert scale used for memory confidence ratings. In our case, L = 5 such
∈ { }
that y 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 .
3.2 Conditional response probabilities
In what follows, we will simply write “old” for x = 1 and “new” for x = 2 for clarity.
i i
Given that the scale we use for memory responses has five response options, let us consider
the following probabilities:
• p – the probability of a non-neutral response, given an individual old or new item (i.e.
choosing 1/2/4/5 rather than 3);
• q – the probability of an aﬀirmative (“old”) response, given a non-neutral response
(i.e. choosing 4/5 rather than 1/2);
• r – the probability of a confident response, given an aﬀirmative (“old”) or
non-aﬀirmative (“new”) response (i.e. choosing 5 rather than 4 or 1 rather than 2).
Then, we can describe the decision process underlying a subject’s memory report in the
• Let us consider a single subject being presented with a single item in retrieval. Then,
the probability that the subject gives a neutral response is (1 p) – in this case, the
response is “3”. The probability that the subject gives a non-neutral response is p.
• Imagine that the subject gives a non-neutral response. Then, the probability that the
subject chooses to label the stimulus as “old” is q – in this case, the response is “4”
or “5”. The probability that the subject chooses “new” is (1 q).
• Imagine that the subject gives an aﬀirmative (“old”) response. Then, the probability
that the subject is certain in their response is r – in this case, the response is “5”. The
probability that the answer is uncertain is (1 r) and the response will be “4”.
Based on this, we can also simulate memory responses for a single subject. For example,
assume that p = 0.90 (corresponding to a low rate of neutral responses), q = 2/3
(corresponding to twice as many stimuli labeled “old”, compared to “new”) and r = 2/3
(corresponding to twice as many certain responses, compared to uncertain). Then, we
can go through a number of trials (say, n = 100), draw random events according to p, q
number of subjects (say, N = 15).

Subsequent memory responses of 15 hypothetical subjects across 100 trials per subject,
simulated using the assumptions described in the text (see probabilities on top).
3.3 Joint response probabilities
Formally, the conditional response probabilities are equivalent to the following events
p = Pr(non-neutral)
q = Pr(aﬀirmative non-neutral) (1)
| |
r = Pr(certain aﬀirmative) = Pr(certain non-aﬀirmative)
Thus, we can calculate joint response probabilities of single-trial response events, for
example that a subject labels a stimulus as “probably old”
Pr(”maybe old”)
= Pr(non-neutral, aﬀirmative, uncertain)

3.4 Probabilistic model
Because we can describe the probability of any possible response event (see eqs. 2 and 3),
we can also describe the probability of the memory response in a particular trial, given
the underlying response frequencies:
> · − ·

(1 p) , if y = 3
i > i
> · · −
> p q (1 r) , if y = 4
· ·
p q r , if y = 5
This is the likelihood function for a single trial, i.e. the probability of observing the
measured data y , given model parameters p, q and r. If trials are assumed to be
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), the total likelihood function is simply
the product of single-trial likelihood functions:
| |
Pr(y p, q, r) = Pr(y p, q, r)
i=1
o +n · − o +n · o +n · − o +n · o +n · − o +n
= p 1245 1245 (1 p) 3 3 q 45 45 (1 q) 12 12 r 15 15 (1 r) 24 24 .
(5)
In this equation, o is the number of old items replied to with “3”, n is the number of
3 45
new items replied to with “4” or “5”, o is the number of old items replied to with “1”,
“2”, “4” or “5” etc. Note that this model does not yet distinguish between responses to
old items and new items.
3.5 Classical model estimation
Classical model estimation proceeds by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), i.e. by
finding those values of p, q and r which maximize the log-likelihood function:
(pˆ, qˆ, rˆ) = arg max log Pr(y p, q, r) (6)
p,q,r
This is leads to the following parameter estimates (see Appendix A):
o + n
1245 1245
pˆ =
o + o + n + n
1245 3 1245 3
o + n
45 45
qˆ = (7)
o + o + n + n
12 45 12 45
o + n
15 15
rˆ = .
o + o + n + n
15 24 15 24
In other words, (i) the estimate for p is equal to the proportion of trials with non-neutral
responses, (ii) the estimate for q is equal to the proportion of aﬀirmative responses, within
non-neutral responses and (iii) the estimate for r is equal to the proportion of certain
responses, within aﬀirmative and non-aﬀirmative responses, consistent with our earlier
defintions (see Section 3.2).
3.6 Bayesian model estimation
Bayesian model estimation proceeds by specifying prior distributions on the model
parameters p, q and r, unconditional on the data y, and then calculating posterior
distributions of those model parameters, conditional on the data.
We use beta distributions as priors on p, q and r, a common choice for proportion-like
quantities bounded in the interval [0, 1] (Gelman et al., 2013, pp. 30/34):
· α − 1 · − β − 1
Pr(p) = Bet(p; α , β ) = p 0p (1 p) 0p
0p 0p
B(α , β )
0p 0p
· α − 1 · − β − 1
Pr(q) = Bet(q; α , β ) = q 0q (1 q) 0q (8)
0q 0q
B(α , β )
0q 0q
· α − 1 · − β − 1
Pr(r) = Bet(r; α , β ) = p 0r (1 p) 0r
0r 0r
B(α , β )
0r 0r
This leads to posterior distributions which are also beta distributions (see Appendix B):
Pr(p y) = Bet(p; α , β ), α = α + o + n , β = β + o + n
np np np 0p 1245 1245 np 0p 3 3
Pr(q y) = Bet(q; α , β ), α = α + o + n , β = β + o + n (9)
nq nq nq 0q 45 45 nq 0q 12 12
Pr(r y) = Bet(r; α , β ), α = α + o + n , β = β + o + n
nr nr nr 0r 15 15 nr 0r 24 24
In a beta distribution, the parameters α > 0 and β > 0 describe how much the unknown
quantity is leaning towards 0 or 1. With α much larger than β, the quantity is more likely
closer to 1 and with β much larger than α, the quantity is more likely closer to 0 and the
expected value is given by α/(α + β) (Bishop, 2007, p. 686).
Note that the posterior concentration parameters (e.g. α and β ) are a function of
np np
the prior concentration parameters (e.g. α and β ) and the observed counts (e.g. o
0p 0p 1245
and n ). In the present context, we will set all prior concentration parameters to 1
which corresponds to uniform distribution with constant density in the interval [0, 1], i.e.
complete absence of knowledge about parameter values.
3.7 Probabilistic model space
So far, the model that we have specified (see Section 3.4) does not distinguish between
old and new items. This is very unrealistic, given that we expect a different probability
of e.g. aﬀirmative responses for old vs. new items, i.e. recognizing more old stimuli, but
rejecting more new stimuli. Therefore, we will now allow the parameters p, q and r to
vary between old and new items. Additionally, we introduce the new model parameter s
to vary the probability of confident responses between accepted and rejected stimuli (i.e.
believed to be old vs. new).
This leads to the revised likelihood function

• p /p – the probability of a non-neutral response to an old/new item;

• q /q – the probability of an aﬀirmative (“old”) response, given a non-neutral response
o n

status (old vs. new). If we decide not to vary some of the parameters, this leads to smaller
models with fewer parameters. The model varying none of the parameters is equivalent
to the likelihood function given by equation (4) which corresponds to the simplest model
Here, we choose to denote those models by names such as “pqqrs” in which a double
letter signifies that a parameter varies and a single letter signifies that a parameter does
not vary between old and new items. Because there are 4 model parameters that can be

3.8 Bayesian model selection
Bayesian model estimation proceeds by calculating the log model evidence (LME), or
logarithmized marginal likelihood, i.e. the probability of observing the data y, given
only the model m, regardless of particular parameter values θ. This can be obtained by
integrating over the likelihood function using a prior density (Soch et al., 2016, eq. 8):
| | |
LME(m) = log Pr(y m) = log Pr(y θ, m) Pr(θ m) dθ . (11)
For our response frequency models with likelihood function Pr(y θ, m) of the form (10)
and prior distributions Pr(θ m) given by beta distributions (8), the LME is a sum of
logarithmized beta functions with prior and posterior concentration parameters as
arguments (see Appendix C), e.g. for the simplest model “pqr”, we have (cf. eqs. 8 and
9):
LME(m) = log B(α , β ) log B(α , β )
np np 0p 0p
+ log B(α , β ) log B(α , β ) (12)
nq nq 0q 0q
+ log B(α , β ) log B(α , β )
nr nr 0r 0r
From LMEs, one can calculate posterior model probabilities Pr(m y), i.e. the probability
that a particular model m generated the observed data y. This requires prior model
probabilities Pr(m) which are usually taken from a uniform distribution (i.e. Pr(m) =
1/M with total number of models M ). Then, Bayes’ theorem implies (Soch et al., 2017,
eq. 7):
Pr(y m ) Pr(m ) exp[LME(m )] Pr(m )
| i i P i i
Pr(m y) = = . (13)
Pr(y) exp[LME(m)] Pr(m)
Again, given that model families can be formed by grouping models according to
exhibiting or not exhibiting a certain model feature, model family inference can be
formed. More precisely, the log family evidence (LFE) of a model family f is calculated
by marginalizing over log model evidences (Soch and Allefeld, 2018, eq. 16)
| | |
LFE(f ) = log Pr(y f ) = log Pr(y m) Pr(m f ) (14)
m f
| |
where Pr(m f ) is a within-family prior distribution (e.g. Pr(m f ) = 1/M with M as the
f f
number of models in family f ). Finally, posterior family probabilities can be calculated
by again using Bayes’ theorem:
Pr(y f ) Pr(f ) exp[LFE(f )] Pr(f )
| j j P j j
Pr(f y) = = (15)
Pr(y) exp[LFE(f )] Pr(f )
where Pr(f ) is an across-family prior distribution (e.g. Pr(f ) = 1/F with number of
model families F ). This allows for Bayesian comparison of model families.
3.9 Maximum-a-posteriori estimates
Given that an optimal model has been identified, maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimates
of the model parameters are defined as the modes of the posterior distributions and
thus can be obtained as those values maximizing the posterior density. For the simplest
model “pqr” and with the prior distributions described above, they are equivalent to the
maximum likelihood estimates from eq. 6 (see Appendix D):

parameters as pˆ, pˆ or pˆ etc.

3.10 Behavioral performance measures
Based on MAP estimates for a single subject, we can calculate a number of measures
Level of decidedness
As noted earlier (see Section 3.2), the parameter p represents the probability of non-
neutral responses, i.e. how often a subject is decided rather than undecided in their
memory response. Thus, the level of decidedness (LD) is defined as the probability of a
non-neutral response and calculated as the estimated proportion of decided responses:
LD = pˆ (17)
If a model belongs to the family “pp”, i.e. varying p as a function of item status, the
Memory performance
Consider that we are working with a model belonging to the family “qq”, i.e.
distinguishing the probability of aﬀirmative responses between old and new items, or
that such a model has been identified as optimal via model selection.
In that case, we define memory performance (MP) as the probability of correct responses.
Consequently, MP is calculated as the probability of aﬀirmative responses to old items
(“hits”) or non-aﬀirmative responses to new items (“correct rejections”), either separately
for old and new items or averaged over both conditions:
MP = qˆ
o o
MP = 1 qˆ

Level of confidence
Assume that we are working with a model belonging to the family “rrss”, i.e.
distinguishing the probability of confident responses between old and new items as well
as between aﬀirmative and non-aﬀirmative responses, or that such a model has been
identified as optimal via model selection.
Under this condition, we define the level of confidence (LC) as the probability of
confident responses. That is, LC is calculated as the average proportion of certain
responses (“definitely old/new”) rather than uncertain responses, again either separated
between old and new items or averaged over both:
LC = (rˆ + sˆ )
o o o
LC = (rˆ + sˆ ) (19)
n n n
1 rˆ + sˆ + rˆ + sˆ
o o n n
LC = (LC + LC ) =

Meta-cognitive accuracy
Observe that r is the probability of a confident response, given an aﬀirmative response
to an old item (“hit”, correct); s is the probability of a confident response, given a non-
aﬀirmative response to a new item (“correct rejection”, correct); r is the probability of a
confident response, given an aﬀirmative response to a new item (“false alarm”, incorrect);
s is the probability of a confident response, given a non-aﬀirmative response to an old
item (“miss”, incorrect).
Therefore, we define meta-cognitive accuracy (MCA) as the probability of agreement
between correctness and confidence. Thus, MCA is calculated as the average proportion
of correct responses being confident and incorrect responses being inconfident, either for
old items, for new items or for both:
MCA = (rˆ + (1 sˆ ))

MCA = ((1 rˆ ) + sˆ ) (20)

Subsequent memory responses can be on a scale from 1 to 5 and are separated for old

defined as the probability of decided responses, i.e. as a contrast of non-neutral against
neutral responses; (B) memory performance (MP) can be quantified as the probability
of correct-given-decided responses, i.e. as a contrast of correct against incorrect non-
neutral responses; (C) a level of confidence (LC) can be calculated as the probability
of confident-given-decided responses, i.e. as a contrast of certain against uncertain non-
neutral responses; and (D) meta-cognitive accuracy (MCA) is defined as the probability
of agreement between correctness and confidence, i.e. as a contrast of confident-and-
correct and inconfident-and-incorrect responses against other responses.
estimates will always fall between 0 (e.g. zero confidence in the case of LC) and 1 (e.g.
perfect memory in the case of MP).
If the measures defined here are understood as “contrasts” of specific events against
others, then it is most natural to describe LD as the global effect of non-neutral responses
recognition and confidence, as the contrast matrix for MCA is equal to the product of

First, we applied Bayesian model selection (see Section 3.8) to identify the optimal model
of the observed behavioral responses, separately for young and older adults. To this end,
the model space of 16 models (see Section 3.7) was sub-divided into model families along

a higher posterior probability than the simpler model family. Due to the overwhelming

one are plotted as outliers (red and blue crosses in B).

Second, we extracted maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimates of the model parameters
of interest (see Section 3.9) from the model identified as optimal. Following the results
of the previous section, we take the model “pqqrrss” as the basis for all of the following
analyses. Results are reported as density plots of MAP estimates, again separately for

5 Discussion
In this paper, we have introduced a subject-level computational model for behavioral
data acquired during episodic memory retrieval. Our model assumes continuous
subsequent memory reports to be governed by the three latent components
Applying Bayesian model selection, we found that decidedness does not vary between old
and new items whereas recognition and confidence have to be distinguished for previously
seen vs. unseen items. Comparing behavioral performance measures between age groups,
we found they do not differ with respect to level of decidedness, but replicating previous
findings, older adults have higher levels of confidence while younger adults show higher
5.1 Probabilistic modelling of subsequent memory reports
Previously, different aspects of retrieval behavior for episodic memory were either
investigated using ad-hoc measures, e.g. by calculating the “corrected hit rate” (= hit
rate minus false alarm rate) to quantify memory performance (Schümann et al., 2018)
and the proportion of certain responses to quantify the level of confidence (Buratti and
Allwood, 2012); or they had to be inferred on using separate models, e.g. by evaluating
the area under the curve (AUC) in receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses to
calculate memory performance, refered to as “A-prime” (Soch et al., 2021a), or
meta-cognitive accuracy, refered to as “type-II ROC” or “meta-d-prime” (Maniscalco
and Lau, 2012; Fleming and Lau, 2014).
More advanced approaches include the joint estimation of recollection and familiarity
from recognition memory ROCs assuming a dual-process theory of recognition (Yonelinas,
1997; Düzel et al., 2010), Bayesian hierarchical models assuming a signal detecting theory
(SDT) framework and accounting for multiple sources of variance (Rouder and Lu, 2005)
and Bayesian race approaches to jointly model reaction time and recognition accuracy in
memory tests (Kim et al., 2017).
Here, we unify the different measures of interest in a single probabilistic model of episodic
memory retrieval. This model assumes subject-level probabilities (see Figures 2 and 3)
describing an individual’s tendency to give a decided response (p), to recognize an item
(q) and to give confident responses (r), possibly separated between recognized and non-
recognized items (s). The model also allows to quantify behavioral performance measures:
the level of decidedness (LD); the level of confidence (LC); memory performance (MP),
i.e. recognition accuracy; and meta-cognitive accuracy (MCA), the agreement between
response correctness and response confidence.
The probabilistic modelling approach has two crucial advantages over other approaches:
First, Bayesian model selection allows to formally test whether model parameters
That is, probabilities can be allowed to vary (double letter) or not vary (single letter)
knowledge. Second, task-related effects can be quantified based on parameter estimates
to give performance measures which are interpretable on the same probability scale as
the model parameters (see Figures 4 and 8).
5.2 Comparison to previous recognition models
Statistical models for episodic recognition memory are a wide and active area of
research. On the one hand, there are single-process models assuming a unitary latent
process determining both performance and awareness of cognition (Berry et al., 2012;
Shanks et al., 2021) which, in episodic memory, could be termed “memory strength”.
On the other hand, there are dual-process models assuming two latent processes behind
memory retrieval, e.g. recollection and familiarity (Yonelinas, 2002; Yonelinas et al.,
2010; Gardiner et al., 1996, 2002). Finally, there are models that extend the signal
detection theory framework from first-level memory cognition to second-level
meta-cognition to derive higher-level performance measures, e.g. “meta-d-prime”
(Maniscalco and Lau, 2012; Fleming and Lau, 2014).
Our model can be seen as a triple-process model, assuming a sequential
decided-then-recognized-then-confident judgement by each participant during each trial
confidence. Clearly, this model does not allow to test recollection vs. familiarity, so that
we can only speak of “high-confidence” or “low-confidence” ratings. Morover,
decidedness cannot really be investigated and the LD cannot be estimated when the
number of response options on the rating scale is even (Ratcliff and Starns, 2009, 2013),
as there is no opportunity for neutral responses and the subject is forced to a decided
response in this case. It should also be noted that the model so far is only supported by
analyzing discrete response distributions and has not been backed with evidence from
continuous reaction time distributions in this study.
5.3 Decidedness and confidence as separate processes
Recognition-confidence ratings are usually thought to emerge from two distinct
cognitive processes, namely recognition accuracy and response confidence, where the
former is regarded the main task-related process and the latter is typically regarded a
meta-cognitive process (Maniscalco and Lau, 2012; Luttrell et al., 2013). Several works
have taken on this assumptions and tested a two-versus-one process model (Busey et al.,
2000; Van Zandt, 2000). Here, we assume a third cognitive process, namely general
decidedness, i.e. a subject’s tendency to give non-neutral responses at all.
Earlier, this has been considered a form of response bias (Busey et al., 2000; Beth et al.,
2009) and studies have found that the frequency of such “middle category responses”
is affected by personality features (Hernández et al., 2004) or argued that “midpoint
responses” should even be considered extreme repsonses (Worthy, 1969).
Because non-neutral responses can be regarded as being more confident than neutral
responses, one could also argue that decidedness and confidence are simply different
degrees of the same cognitive process, termed “decidedness-confidence”. However, the
present study justifies regarding decidedness and confidence as separate processes and this
justification is three-fold: First, the decidedness-related p does not vary between old and
Second, LD does not significantly differ between young and older adults whereas LC is

5.4 Recognition, confidence and meta-cognitive accuracy
As we have seen, LC is correlated to all other behavioral performance measures, i.e. LD,
example, with higher level of confidence, participants show better memory performance,
indicating that those who give more confident responses also perform better on the
task, replicating a previously known positive relationship between confidence levels and
recognition performance (see Clark, 1997 for an overview).
At the same time, however, errors can also be committed with high confidence. In our
data set, we observed that the effect of LC on MCA is negative, suggesting that higher
confidence in subsequent memory reponses comes at the cost of lower meta-cognitive
accuracy. This is consistent with older adults being more susceptible to semantic priming
which makes stimuli “feel old” even though they are not (Fandakova et al., 2018; Jacoby
and Rhodes, 2006; Koutstaal and Schacter, 1997). It is also in line with the vast literature
on semantic priming and false memory effects in old age which are usually investigated
using the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm (Akhtar et al., 2020; Evrard et al., 2016;
Brod et al., 2013; Sweeney-Reed et al., 2012). Hypothetically, the negative effect of LC
on MCA could be a hubris effect, explainable by semantic priming being able to elicit
high-confidence false alarms (Grimmer et al., 2022; Laukkonen et al., 2020).
Looking more closely at this relationship, it appears there is a quadratic effect between
LC and MCA, with higher MCA values for more medium LC values. The reason for this
is that with both, zero overall confidence (i.e. all non-neutral responses uncertain) as
well as total overall confidence (i.e. all non-neutral responses certain), it is impossible
to quantify meta-cognitive ability, because there cannot be any confidence differences
between correct and incorrect responses – which is exactly what MCA is based on.
Indeed, individual differences have been reported to exist in the accuracy of confidence
judgements, i.e. meta-cognitive knowledge (Pallier et al., 2002). This confidence in one’s
own cognitive ability, seen as a personality trait, appears to be relatively stable across a
wide range of diﬀiculty levels (Pallier et al., 2002). Moreover, older adults have been found
to show reduced accuracy in confidence judgements for episodic memory, and this age-
related impairment in meta-cognitive accuracy was independent of memory performance
(Wong et al., 2012). This is replicated by the age-group differences for MCA and the
5.5 Limitations and directions for future research
One limitation of this study is that it uses cross-sectional rather than longitudinal data,
so that it is not clear whether the observed age-related differences are truly due to
progression of age in healthy adults or a mere generational effect.
Moreover, the present study did not in any way utilize response times of subsequent
memory reports or neuroimaging data associated with them. In the future, we therefore
want to extend the pqrs model to continuous quantities measured during memory
encoding or retrieval, such as reaction times (RTs) or neurophysiological signals (fMRI,
EEG), by conceptualizing decidedness, recognition and confidence as parametric
variables modulating those measurements. In theory, this would allow to establish
evidence from RT distributions in favor of the three-component model.
Finally, future research may investigate how estimates of behavioral performance
measures obtained from the pqrs model change as a function of sensory modality (e.g.
visual vs. auditory), stimulus material (e.g. pictures vs. words), encoding type (i.e.
incidental vs. intentional), encoding-retrieval delay (e.g. 1 hour vs. 1 day) and the
resolution of the memory response scale (e.g. 5 vs. 9 levels).
5.6 Conclusion
The current paper addressed the question what kind of information can be distinguished
from behavioral responses obtained with bipolar recognition-confidence rating scales
(often used in episodic memory tests) and which model is most adequate for two
independent age groups (healthy young and older adults). The presented probabilistic
model proved fruitful for the investigation of episodic memory processes and revealed
that these processes are distinct in terms of their item- and age-related differences.
In the present experimental design, subjects’ subsequent memory reports were recorded by the
experimenter, such that reaction times were unrealiable and not used for statistical analysis.

E Extension to different response scales
The model presented in this paper was developed for subsequent memory responses on
a Likert scale comprising L = 5 levels. Here, we describe how the model can be easily
adapted to an arbitrary number of levels L:
• If L is an even number (e.g. L = 4), there is no neutral level and the parameter p
is forced to 1, i.e. all responses are decided. In this case, the number of parameters
reduces by 1 (or by 2, if p differed between old and new items).
• If the number of non-neutral levels in one direction is smaller than 2 (e.g. L = 3),
there is no differentiation of responses by confidence and the parameters r is forced
to 1, i.e. all non-neutral responses are equally confident. In this case, the number of
parameters reduces by 1 (or by 2, if r differed between old and new items [or by 4, if
r also differed between aﬀirmative and non-aﬀirmative responses]).
• If the number of non-neutral levels in one direction is larger than 2 (i.e. L > 5), there
are more than two different levels of confidence. In this case, we suggest to model each
step beyond the neutral level (i.e. each step in direction of maximum confidence) as
a Bernoulli trial, such that the absolute difference between the actual rating and the
neutral level follows a binomial distribution. More precisely, if the number of steps
beyond the neutral level is
