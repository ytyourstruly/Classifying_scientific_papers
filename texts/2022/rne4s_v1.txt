Abstract
23 In the classical twin design, researchers compare trait resemblance in cohorts of identical and
24 non-identical twins to understand how genetic and environmental factors correlate with
25 resemblance in behaviour and other phenotypes. The twin design is also a valuable tool for studying
26 causality, intergenerational transmission, gene-environment correlation and interaction. Here we
27 review recent developments in twin studies, recent results from twin studies of new phenotypes, and
28 recent insights into twinning. We ask whether the results of existing twin studies are representative
29 of the general population and of global diversity, and conclude that stronger efforts to increase
30 representativeness are needed. We provide an updated overview of twin concordance and
31 discordance for major diseases and mental disorders, which conveys a crucial message: genetic
32 influences are not as deterministic as many believe. This has important implications for public
33 understanding of genetic risk prediction tools, as the accuracy of genetic predictions can never
34 exceed identical twin concordance rates.
35 Behavioural scientists are often interested in understanding how human traits, such as
36 intelligence, educational attainment, depression, and anxiety, are influenced by inherited and
37 environmental factors. Since long before the advent of human genomics, researchers have relied on
38 twin studies to answer these questions. The classical twin design compares trait resemblances in
39 monozygotic twins (MZ) to traits in dizygotic twins (DZ). Because monozygotic twins are genetically
40 identical, and dizygotic twins share 50% of their genes on average, any additional similarity between
1,2
41 identical twins should be related to genes, provided that twins share the same environments .
42 Researchers can apply the classical twin design to estimate the influence of genes for any trait
43 they can measure and extend the classical twin design to model causal relations between exposures
44 and traits, to describe differences within discordant twin pairs, to estimate genetic and cultural
45 components of inheritance, and account for measured genetic variables and environmental
46 exposures.
47 In this review, we examine the use of twin studies as researchers become interested in new
48 phenotypes, including those based on omics technologies. We reflect on methods for achieving
49 progress in fields that have traditionally valued twin studies of individual differences, explore which
50 fields offer new opportunities for twin research, and how insights from other disciplines can inform
51 twin studies. We begin by introducing the classical twin design. We then summarise concordance and
52 discordance in twin pairs for major psychiatric and somatic disorders, arguing that no other design is
53 as informative for studying penetrance and genetic prediction of disease risk. Next, we turn to
54 assumptions and advances in research methods and the study of twinning as a phenotype, which is
55 important for the mothers of twins, for female fertility, and may inform developmental biology. We
56 conclude by discussing existing knowledge gaps in twin studies.
Classic twin design and twin concordance and discordance
58 Classic twin design
59 The classical twin design compares the resemblance of MZ and DZ twins for uni- or
60 multivariate traits to estimate heritability and genetic correlations among phenotypes (a glossary of
61 key terms is provided in Box 1). It decomposes phenotypic variance and covariance among traits into
62 genetic and non-genetic components, based on the biometrical model P=G+E, where P, G, and E
63 represent uni- or multivariate phenotypes, individual genetic values, and environmental deviations,
64 respectively . P is measured, whereas G and E need not be observed, but their influence is estimated
65 by comparing MZ and DZ twins, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The influence of the genotype can be
66 summarised as the heritability of a trait: the proportion of variance due to genetic factors.
67 Twin resemblance can be quantified in concordance or correlations. Concordance and
68 discordance refer to the degree of similarity or difference between twins in terms of their phenotypes.
69 Concordance is typically applied to dichotomous phenotypes, such as the existence of a disorder, while
70 correlations are used to summarise twin resemblance for continuous traits. Similar concordance rates in
71 MZ and DZ twin pairs suggest a larger role of environmental factors, while a higher concordance in MZ
72 than DZ twin pairs suggests stronger genetic effects. For continuous traits, we double the difference
73 between the MZ and DZ correlations to obtain a first estimate of heritability, i.e. the proportion of
74 variance explained by genetic factors. However, the relation between twin concordance and trait
75 heritability is more complex because it depends on the prevalence of a disorder in the population.
76 Twin concordance and discordance
77 Fig. 2a presents an overview of estimates of twin proband-wise concordance rates (or case-wise
78 with full ascertainment) in complex diseases, either directly obtained from publications, by computing
79 proband-wise concordance from the published data, or by contacting the authors. To estimate
80 heritability, researchers cannot only look at the differences in concordance rates between MZ and DZ
81 twins, but their resemblance must be obtained on the underlying liability scale by tetrachoric
5,6
82 correlations . Fig. 2b (based on Smith 1970) shows the relation between concordance, prevalence of a
84 prevalences ranging from 0.01% for rare traits to 80% for common ones. It is especially striking that for
85 traits with a low prevalence and a high heritability most MZ twins will be discordant.
86 These results provide valuable information for research and society. While genetic effects are
87 evident from the higher concordance in MZ twins than in DZ pairs, concordance in MZ twins does not
88 approach 100%, even for highly heritable traits such as schizophrenia . Explaining why one person
89 becomes affected and their co-twin with an identical genotype is protected involves identifying
90 environmental factors, epigenetic mechanisms, and DNA mutations that occurred in one twin but not
91 in the co-twin.
92 The extent to which the concordance rates in MZ twins are lower than 100% conveys how
93 predictive the genotype will be for individual outcomes. An individual’s genetic liability to a disorder
94 can be seen as providing a baseline, with other factors influencing whether that liability ends up
95 passing the threshold for disease penetrance. Thus, twin concordance rates powerfully illustrate that
96 even a strong genetic predisposition does not have to result in the development of a disease.
97 The genome is not deterministic. Processes such as epigenetics, including X-inactivation, in-
98 utero exposure, and post-natal environment, may lead to changes in DNA expression within MZ
99 pairs. Epigenetic and DNA expression differences were found in MZ twins discordant for
100 inflammation-related diseases, such as Lupus , and for psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders,
10 11
101 including schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease . Differences in discordant MZ twin pairs have also
12,13 14,15 16,17
102 been observed for proteomic and metabolomic profiles , and in multi-omics studies .
103 For biomarkers, including omics profiles, it remains challenging to establish whether twin
104 discordance is a cause or consequence of the disease. Here, MZ twin pairs are valuable to examine
105 causality , especially when combined with the longitudinal data in twin registries. In one example,
106 addressing the causes versus consequences of smoking behaviour , longitudinal phenotype data
107 were combined with gene expression profiles and 132 differentially expressed genes were identified
108 in current, former, and never smokers. Nearly all genes (125) had reversible effects on gene
109 expression levels. In 56 MZ pairs discordant for current smoking, only six genes were differentially
110 expressed, but the effects for 75% of the genes in the discordant MZ twin pairs were in the same
111 direction as in the total population.
112 For diseases that are more common at an older age, one needs to consider that the disease
113 can still manifest at later follow-up. Careful consideration of the age composition of the sample is
114 therefore required, as illustrated by studies investigating twin concordance rates for Parkinson’s
20,21
115 disease (PD) . When twins were studied at an average age of 74 years, researchers found similar
116 concordance rates for late-onset PD (>50 years of age) in MZ and DZ pairs. When they later searched
117 the US National Death Index for all twin pairs with PD in at least one twin, they found higher
118 concordance among MZ than DZ twins at follow-up and heritability was now estimated at 20% for
119 late-onset PD.
120 In an era of genetic testing services and polygenic scores (PGS), the upper limit of genomic
121 predictions must be defined and acknowledged. Researchers and clinicians may currently see risk
122 prediction tools as having an upper limit set by trait heritability, but in fact predictions can only go as far
123 as the MZ twin concordance rates.
124 Assumptions of the classical twin design
125 In its most basic application, the classical twin design assumes random mating in the parents of
126 twins, and that environmental factors that influence a trait are similar for MZ and DZ twins so that any
127 differences in the similarity of the twins’ traits can be attributed to genetic factors. This so-called equal
128 environment assumption has been tested numerous times and holds for most phenotypes .
129 Researchers can test assumptions regarding equality of means and variances in MZ and DZ twins and the
130 absence of interactions or correlations between genes and environment with appropriate data and
131 methods, and deviations from these assumptions may provide new insights as we will discuss below.
132 Another assumption entails that twins are representative of the population to which heritability
24,25
133 and other estimates apply. Twins and singletons are similar in most respects , even though twins are
134 born earlier on average and grow up with a sibling of the same age. Twins and non-twins have similar
26 27 28 29
135 biomarker profiles and diseases , cognitive functions , health behaviours , personality , and
136 psychopathology . Despite early hypotheses that twins from DZ pairs are more often chimeric than
137 singletons, a large study in twin-family pedigrees found this not to be the case . Although twins are
32 33 34
138 born earlier on average, and have lower birth weight and body mass index (BMI) , genetic
139 correlations of twin and singleton birth weight are not significantly different from each other , meaning
140 that the same genes influence birth weight in twins and singletons. Consequently, data from twins can
141 be combined with other population-based results or included in population-based genome-wide
142 association studies (GWAS) to increase the sample size. As David Lykken stated in his 1982 presidential
143 address to the Society for Psychophysiological Research: “Twins are probably more representative of the
144 general population than any other group […]. This representativeness is even more true of the families
145 of twins” .
146 DNA sequence differences within monozygotic twin pairs
147 Post-zygotic (i.e. after fertilisation) mutations occurring in one twin of an identical pair can lead to
148 genetic and phenotypic differences between them. However, if such mutations occur early in embryonic
149 development, i.e. before a split occurs, both twins will have the mutation. In a DNA sequencing project
150 of 381 Icelandic twin pairs and two triplet sets, 39 pairs differed by over 100 mutations, while 38 pairs
151 did not differ at all . The median number of post-zygotic mutations differing within twin pairs was 14,
152 with a higher estimate of 48 for high-coverage pairs. In 78 parent-offspring trios from the same
153 population, 4,933 de novo mutations were reported, i.e. an average rate of 1.2x10 -8 per nucleotide per
38 -8
154 generation . A review also put 1.18x10 per position as the best estimate of the average human
155 germline mutation rate, corresponding to 74 novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and
156 approximately three novel structural variants 39 per genome per generation. De novo mutations are
157 enriched in coding and regulatory regions of the genome 40 . Thus, it is not surprising that de novo
158 mutations account for a substantial component of some rare genetic syndromes, and that mutations in
159 one twin but not the other can lead to discordance between them. For highly polygenic traits, individual
160 SNP effects are very small. If only a few SNPs are discordant per pair, the effects of these would be
161 negligible. While it is likely that de novo mutations do not impact twin-based heritability estimates of
162 polygenic traits, we should be cautious when investigating rare genetic disorders that only involve a
163 small number of genes or disorders that involve de novo mutations particularly.
164 DNA sequence differences between MZ twins can also inform on the timing of developmental
165 mutations. Germ cells are specified around the third week after fertilisation, a process referred to as
166 primordial germ cell specification (PGCS). If post-zygotic de novo mutations are present in both the soma
167 and germline of a twin, we can classify them as pre-PGCS. Both twins can share pre-PGCS mutations, or
168 these can be present in just one twin, indicating whether mutations occurred before or after the
169 twinning split. When post-zygotic mutations are present in the soma or the germline of both a proband
170 twin and their offspring, we can classify them as post-PGCS mutations.
Methodological developments in twin studies
172 The classical twin design can be extended to explore gene-environment interactions and
173 correlations. Gene-environment interaction (GxE) can be conceptualised as moderation, where genes
174 moderate the environmental effects, or where the environment moderates or controls genetic
175 effects. Gene-environment correlation (rGE) describes a correlation between G and the E in the
176 model P = G + E and is sometimes viewed as genetic control over exposure to different
177 environments. There is ample theoretical work on gene-environment interactions, but relatively little
178 empirical work. In contrast, several developments have stimulated the study of rGE. These involve
179 adding measured G or E to the design, extensions to longitudinal data, and the addition of family
180 members, such as the parents or the offspring of twins.
181 Gene-Environment correlation
182 Detecting rGE in the twin design can be achieved by including measured genetic or
183 environmental variables. For instance, if the phenotype is depression, marital status may be a
184 relevant measured environment, and a PGS for depression a relevant genetic variable. If genetic
185 factors influence depression and marital status, this gives rise to rGE. Obviously, this approach
186 requires a prior expectation about which environmental variable to assess. By including a measured
187 genetic variable, e.g. a PGS for depression, we can estimate the correlation between all genetic
188 factors that influence depression, and the shared family environment . This approach is exploratory
189 as it can detect rGE, but it does not require prior hypotheses concerning the environmental
190 influences involved in the rGE.
191 An alternative approach to studying rGE in the classical twin design is by analysing longitudinal
192 data . Given repeated measures, rGE can be modelled by estimating the regression of the latent
193 environmental variable at time t (say E ) on the phenotype at time t-1 (P ). This regression implies
t t-1
194 rGE by the following chain of regression relationships: the genotype at t-1 influences the phenotype
195 at t-1, which influences E . So, P mediates the relationship between G and E , thus giving rise to
t t-1 t-1 t
196 rGE (Fig. 3). This influence of the phenotype on the environment may arise if children actively seek
197 out or create environmental circumstances, which match their genotype. Given the own role of the
198 child, this is called active rGE or “niche-picking”. This may apply to for example, intelligence and
199 musicality. Alternatively, the behaviour of the child may elicit responses from persons in its
200 environment, called evocative rGE. Examples are highly outgoing children, who encourage social
201 interaction, or aggressive children, who may discourage social interaction and elicit corrective
202 parenting.
203 Simultaneous environmental and genetic transmission across generations also leads to
204 correlations between genotype and environment in offspring, since their genotype depends on the
205 parental genotypes (genetic transmission), and their environment (partly) depends on the parental
206 genotypes, as mediated by the parental phenotype (cultural transmission). This form of rGE is called
207 passive rGE, as the twin offspring are the (passive) recipients of parental genes and an environment
208 (partly) created by parents. The environment that parents create depends on the genotype they
209 transmit to their offspring and on the part that is not transmitted. The parent-twin design can
210 incorporate the effect of the non-transmitted genotypes on offspring outcomes (depicted in Fig. 1).
211 In the children-of-twins design, which involves MZ and DZ twin pairs as parents, researchers
212 compare the resemblance between parents and their own children to the resemblance between
44–46
213 offspring and their parent's co-twin . In both the children-of-twins design and the parents-of-
214 twins design, researchers estimate the effect that remains after accounting for direct genetic
215 transmission, which induces a correlation between genotype and the shared environment.
216 A new way of modelling parental transmitted and non-transmitted genotypes is in SEM-PGS
217 (Structural Equation Modelling combined with Polygenic Scores), which disentangles parental genetic
218 and environmental effects on offspring traits while controlling for assortative mating, thereby providing
219 unbiased estimates of genetic transmission . Researchers can use SEM-PGS with trio data but also with
220 twin pairs . This way, they can study parental effects by combining both GWAS and twin-based designs.
221 The outcomes of intergenerational twin studies can help to inform intervention approaches
222 and avoid parent-blaming . An example can be seen in cases where a child is struggling in school,
223 and the teacher blames its parents for not providing a suitable home environment or not being
224 involved in their child’s education. In a parent-twin study of offspring years of education, there was a
225 direct effect of parental genes that were inherited by the twin offspring , making it difficult to hold
226 the parents responsible for passing on their genes. The indirect (genetic nurturing) effect of parental
227 genes that were not transmitted to offspring weakened after controlling for parental IQ or
228 socioeconomic status (SES), implying that the genetic nurturing effect on education reflects family
229 SES rather than any deliberate parenting behaviour . Genetic nurture effects are often interpreted
230 as parenting effects but may also reflect the broader family environment.
231 Gene-Environment interaction
232 Researchers can investigate GxE by comparing heritability estimates across different
233 environments. One recent example is before and during exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic. A
234 comparison of heritability before and during the first lockdown in the Netherlands (gene-by-crisis
235 interaction) showed a slight increase in heritability estimates for optimism and meaning of life during
236 the first months of the pandemic and lower than unity genetic correlations across time (.75 and .63),
237 implying GxE, with both quantitative and qualitative difference in genetic influences .
238 Purcell suggested a broad method to measure changes in heritability based on traits that could
239 potentially have a heritable factor . Some caution is needed if such traits, or moderators, are
240 themselves correlated between twins, but several solutions exist . Molenaar et al. (2012) developed
241 an alternative approach which does not require a measured moderator to estimate GxE . Their
56,57
242 method exploits the fact that GxE will introduce heteroscedasticity . By modelling environmental
243 variance conditional on the genetic variance, they test for departures from bivariate normality in
244 twin data. This method can explicitly estimate GxE without a priori hypotheses about specific
245 interacting genotypes or environments.
246 Interaction among family members
247 Individuals can contribute to the environment of their family members, including twins and
44,58 59
248 their co-twins , and these effects can either be competitive or cooperative . Under competition,
249 the higher the expression of a trait in one sibling, the less it will be exhibited in the other sibling.
250 Under cooperation, a trait expressed more strongly in one sibling will also be exhibited more in the
251 other sibling. The presence of sibling interaction may be optimally detected in twin designs. Here,
252 violation of the equal variance assumption in the two zygosity groups implies either cooperation or
253 competition: inflated phenotypic variances and increased twin correlations imply cooperation, while
254 deflated variances and decreased DZ correlations relative to MZ correlations suggest competition.
255 Both inflation and deflation act more on the variance of MZ twins than of DZ twins, thereby making
256 the twin design a powerful tool to detect and distinguish competitive and collaborative interactions.
257 Multilevel twin models
258 When working with data from twins, natural clusters occur that are created by the fact that we
259 include individuals from the same family unit. These family units are further nested in higher-level
260 clusters such as geographic region, neighbourhood, or school. If both twins in a pair share higher-level
261 clustering variables, their effects will be reflected in the estimate for the common environment in the
262 classic twin design. In multilevel twin models, variance is decomposed into within-pair variance on the
263 first level (i.e. representing differences between twins within a pair), between-family variance on the
264 second level (i.e. differences between pairs or families), and the variance of a higher-level clustering
265 variable on the third level (e.g. differences between geographical regions) . For instance, multilevel
266 twin modelling can clarify the relationship between geographic regional clustering and ancestry, as seen
267 in regional clustering for height in 7-year-old Dutch twins, where, after adjusting for ancestry, the
268 variation in height was no longer explained by region . Hence, regional clustering effects may mask
269 genetic ancestry effects, which can be disentangled in multilevel twin models.
270 Causal modelling in twin designs
271 Randomised controlled trials are considered the gold standard for establishing causality, but
272 these are often not feasible or ethical in health and behavioural research. In such cases, researchers
273 can turn to genetic designs such as Mendelian Randomization (MR) and the Direction of Causation
274 (DoC) twin models to study causality. MR uses an observed genetic variable (e.g., SNP or PGS) as an
275 instrumental variable that is assumed to correlate with the exposure variable, but not with
276 confounding variable(s) or the outcome . However, MR analysis with SNPs has low statistical power
277 and PGSs will often be unfeasible due to genetic pleiotropy. The bivariate Direction of Causation
278 (DoC) twin model was proposed for twin data to test causal relationships between two variables.
279 Depending on whether trait A causes trait B or vice versa, i.e. the direction of causation, the model
280 predicts different cross-twin cross-trait correlations. The DoC model only works in situations where
281 two variables have different modes of inheritance i.e. one trait is influenced by the shared
282 environment while the other is mainly influenced by genes . Combining MR with the DoC twin
283 approach in an MR-DoC model yields a causal test that does not require the mode of inheritance to
284 differ for the two variables and relaxes several critical MR assumptions concerning pleiotropy. If PGSs
285 of twins are used as instrumental variables in a bivariate classical twin design, the PGSs can correlate
64,65
286 with both predictor and outcome . Thus, combining DNA-based methods with twin-based designs
287 can overcome the limitations of individual methods. While no single approach is free of bias,
288 triangulation can help address the limitations of methods and facilitate replicable and reproducible
289 results.
290 The added value of twins when decomposing heritability
291 The classical twin design can be combined with genome-based restricted maximum likelihood
66,67
292 (GREML) methods to simultaneously estimate SNP heritability and pedigree-based heritability . SNP
293 heritability refers to the contribution of measured SNPs to trait heritability. Pedigree-based heritability
294 captures heritability based on the known relationships among not too distantly related family members.
295 Here, closely related family members are typically defined as cousins two or three times removed or
296 closer. This approach is referred to as ‘threshold Genetic Relationship Matrix (GRM)’ and relies on two
297 GRMs: one GRM including all genetic relationships, and one where the genetic relationship among
298 distantly related pairs of individuals is set to zero to capture pedigree-associated variation. The total
299 heritability is obtained by summing the estimates as obtained from both GRMs (Fig. 4). By including
300 additional GRMs that comprise specific SNPs, researchers can extend the threshold GRM approach to
301 capture the contribution of functional or biologically relevant elements . For example, a four-GRM
302 approach was used to obtain heritability estimates for known metabolite loci and distinguish between
303 metabolite classes . Besides the GRMs in the threshold approach, from which all metabolite loci were
304 removed, this study included a third GRM to capture the metabolite loci of a specific metabolite class,
305 and a fourth GRM to include all metabolite loci for all other metabolite classes.
Advances in health and behavioural phenotypes
307 Twinning
308 Dizygotic and monozygotic twinning have different biological mechanisms. DZ twins result
309 from two separate fertilisations and have different placentas and foetal membranes. MZ twins, on
310 the other hand, come from a single sperm and egg and separate within two weeks of fertilisation. MZ
70 71–
311 twins may have shared or separate amnions and chorions . DZ twinning has a genetic component
312 , but estimates of heritability for being a DZ twin mother are remarkably scarce. Duffy and Martin
313 (2022) estimated the heritability of twinning in historical pedigrees to lie between 8% and 20% .
314 They could not distinguish between MZ and DZ twins, potentially underestimating the true
315 heritability, but their estimate was consistent across time (8-19 generations) and ancestries (West
316 Africa, Europe, and Canada).
317 The first GWAS for being a mother of natural DZ twins identified two genes, which replicated in
318 the deCODE Icelandic database 75 , namely FSHB (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Beta Subunit) and
319 SMAD3 (SMAD Family Member 3), with risk alleles increasing the frequency of twin births in Iceland
320 by 18% and 9%, respectively. Whereas FSH genes are strong candidates for DZ twinning, the finding
321 for SMAD3, which is expressed in the human ovaries, was new. SNPs associated with dizygotic
322 twinning have an impact on several reproductive traits, including increased fertility (having more
323 children), decreased risk of polycystic ovary syndrome, earlier onset of menstruation, earlier natural
324 menopause, and giving birth to the first child at a younger age.
325 In contrast, the genetic aetiology for MZ twinning remains unclear, but van Dongen et al.
326 (2021) discovered a strong epigenetic signature for MZ twinning comprising 834 differentially
327 methylated positions in adult somatic tissues . The loci were enriched for putative metastable epi-
328 alleles, that are epigenetic marks or modifications that occur during early development. This lifelong
329 signature opens up new avenues to investigate the vanishing MZ twin syndrome, i.e. the
330 disappearance of an embryo during early pregnancy , and congenital disorders that have an
331 overrepresentation of MZ twins .
332 Phenotypes of increasing interest
333 Twin studies are not only of interest to psychology, biology, and medicine but also to fields
79,80
334 such as political science, sociology, and economics . In economics, twin studies demonstrated
335 genetic effects in classic economic paradigms like the trust game, which manipulates participants’
336 willingness to invest money and to reciprocate others’ trust . In political science, twin studies
337 showed that genetic contributions to political ideology are largely independent of the chosen
338 measurement, time, or population . Inside and outside of these fields, topics previously studied
339 become relevant again and new ones arise. For example, during the global COVID-19 pandemic, a
340 study in twins estimated a heritability of 31% for COVID-19 based on self-reported symptoms .
341 The outcomes of twin studies can benefit interventions. Since genetic influences can change
342 over a lifetime, the longitudinal nature of twin registers can inform policy decisions aimed at a
84 85
343 specific age group . For example, as obesity often starts in childhood and twin studies show that
344 the heritability of BMI increases throughout childhood , this suggests that public health
345 interventions might be most beneficial earlier in childhood rather than later in life. We may see this
346 process as a recursive loop where policies can inspire new questions for researchers, and results
347 from research can lead to new policies. Society and its political, economic, and social agents
348 influence funding decisions, thus making twin studies relevant to a wide audience. This includes
349 economists looking at the costs and benefits of policy decisions, sociologists studying the effects of a
350 policy decision in society, and political scientists studying the entire process of policy development.
351 Scientists develop interests in phenotypes that become accessible because of our
352 technological advancement. Digital fingerprinting, the unique trace of a person’s activity on the
88,89
353 internet , is one example of such a phenotype. Language used on Facebook can predict depression
354 symptoms , and more complete digital fingerprints may serve as predictors for other health and
355 behavioural outcomes. However, researchers do not know if digital fingerprints in MZ twins are as
356 similar as their physical fingerprints. One study found that genetic effects can fully explain the
357 familial resemblance in the frequency of internet use, and that genetic and environmental factors
358 account for different aspects of use . It seems plausible that variance in digital fingerprints will also
359 have a heritable component. If MZ twins have highly similar digital fingerprints (more so than DZ
360 twins or siblings), this also creates options for the application of the classical twin design to
361 nationwide register data, as these registers contain information on the entire population of twins,
362 but often lack information on zygosity for same-sex pairs.
363 An approach to handle unknown zygosity was suggested by combining twin and sibling data in
364 register data . Male-female pairs are DZ, but same-sex pairs are MZ or DZ. As there are equal numbers
365 of opposite- and same-sex DZ twin pairs, we know the proportion of DZ pairs. As same-sex DZ twins and
366 same-sex siblings share the same genetic similarity, we can utilise the ratios of concordant and
367 discordant pairs of the latter as weighting factors to determine the number of concordant and
368 discordant pairs for same-sex DZ and MZ twin pairs. This approach has been used to estimate the
369 heritability for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in German health insurance data (.77 for females
370 and .88 for males) as inferred from ICD-10 diagnoses and drug prescriptions. These estimates closely
371 resemble those obtained from classical twin studies. Thus, with only sex and diagnostic status of twin
372 and sibling pairs, researchers could determine the contribution of genetics.
373 Neural and symptom networks
374 Twin studies can shed light on the genetic influence on the development, prognosis, and
375 comorbidity of neuropsychological and psychopathological disorders by analysing the network
93,94
376 parameters of these disorders . Researchers investigate the genetics of nodes and edges in Graph
377 Theory-based networks or in network analyses of psychopathological phenotypes. Network
378 parameters, such as the efficiency of the structural brain network, derived from magnetic resonance
95,96 97
379 imaging data, have strong genetic correlations with intelligence and schizophrenia . In networks
380 of structural and functional brain connectivity, the heritability of network parameters ranges from
382 In networks for psychopathological disorders, central nodes (nodes with a relatively large number of
383 connections to nodes in the network) generally have higher heritability .
384 Applications of network analyses face numerous challenges, including a lack of criteria for
99,100
385 identifying the completeness of networks, and heterogeneity and replicability of networks .
386 Network configuration can vary for different patients and across time, challenging the generalisability
387 and reliability of network approaches . Twin studies can help resolve such issues by considering twin
388 resemblance for network parameters, where high correlations in MZ twins imply high reliability .
389 Omics traits
390 Recent technological advancements in measuring genetic variation, transcriptome,
391 epigenome, proteome, and metabolome have enabled researchers to study heritability in twin
392 cohorts through classical twin designs or a combination of classical twin designs and GREML.
393 Heritability estimates for gene expression from twin studies that characterise RNA transcripts
394 in a cell by microarrays or sequencing differ by tissue. For example, adipose tissue has a higher
395 average heritability (26%) compared to lymphoblastoid cell lines (21%) and skin tissue (16%) . The
396 average heritability of peripheral blood gene expression is between 10% and 20%, with mean
397 heritability estimates significantly higher in RNA sequencing studies than those from microarray-
68,103
398 expression data .
399 Twin-based heritability estimates for DNA methylation vary by sex and age. DNA methylation,
400 the most commonly measured epigenetic mechanism in epidemiological studies, involves the
401 addition of a methyl group to the C5 position of cytosines in the DNA, which decreases the genome
402 accessibility for transcription, thereby regulating gene expression . Based on adult twin data, the
403 heritability of blood DNA methylation across the genome was 19% on average, with common SNPs
404 explaining on average 7% of the variance, i.e., 37% of the total twin-based heritability . Heritability
405 for DNA methylation decreased with age, driven by an increase in environmental variance. A
406 combination of multiple twin datasets across the lifespan (0-92 years) demonstrated an increase in
407 familial correlations in MZ and DZ twins from birth to adolescence and a decrease after young
408 adulthood . The rate of change in familial correlations was similar in MZ and DZ pairs, which
409 suggested that age affected the influence of environmental rather than genetic effects on DNA
410 methylation across the lifespan.
411 Twin studies of proteomics and metabolomics generally report higher heritability estimates
412 than those found for transcriptome and epigenome variables. One study in female twins estimated
413 genes accounted for 13.6% of the variance in plasma protein levels . Post-translational
414 modifications of proteins, particularly glycosylation (attachment of a glycan to a protein), are also
108,109
415 heritable, with many N-glycans showing high heritability (>50%) in plasma . Metabolites
416 comprise a diverse set of small molecules (<1.5kDa) involved in cellular metabolism, including amino
417 acids, sugars, and lipids . Twin-based heritability estimates of blood metabolite levels cluster
111,112
418 around 50% but can differ among metabolite classes . Similar heritability estimates have been
113,114
419 observed for urinary metabolites .
420 To fully understand biological processes, we need to collect and analyse data from multiple
421 omics domains together . Simultaneous multi-omics modelling can complement single-omics
422 analyses by accounting for the relationships among omics domains . We anticipate that the fusion
423 of twin designs with data from multiple omics domains will enhance the categorisation or
424 differentiation of diseases and the forecasting of biomarkers.
Concluding remarks
426 In today’s globalised and increasingly interconnected research world, collaboration and
427 cooperation are key. Over 60 twin registers are in place worldwide, across multiple continents in 26
428 countries , with many collaborating in the CODATwins (COllaborative project of Development of
429 Anthropometrical measures in Twins) project that amassed and shares data on height, BMI, and
430 size at birth from 54 twin projects from 24 countries. Results for height and BMI are remarkable, as
431 the differences in heritability estimates were minor across twin cohorts from different cultural-
432 geographic regions, and in individuals from different birth cohorts or for whom height and BMI were
433 obtained at different ages.
434 Existing registries cannot always answer novel research questions, and replication of findings
435 in understudied twin populations warrants the development of new twin registries . Particularly,
436 African, Arab, Hispanic, and other non-European populations are still underrepresented in twin
437 research. Also, some age groups are still underrepresented in twin studies. With the lengthening of
438 average life expectancies and the rapid rise of aging populations, understanding the causes and
439 effects of aging and age-related declines in health is vital . While twin studies can make valuable
440 contributions to these research topics, few current registries include twins of advanced age.
441 Eventually, longitudinal registries may aid here by following their participants into advanced age, and
442 establishing geriatric cohorts will accelerate research into aging. Another solution, that also tackles
443 the attrition often observed in longitudinal studies, involves linking existing twin registers to
444 electronic health records and other national registers.
445 Periconceptional and prenatal variables remain understudied . In a large meta-analysis of
446 heritability estimates in over 14 million twin pairs for over 17 thousand traits , less than 5% of the
447 studies published between 1958 and 2012 investigated early life traits or childhood-onset disorders.
448 The low heritability estimates and substantial shared environmental effects reported for several of
123,124
449 these traits might make them especially interesting to study . Researchers should ideally follow
450 mothers of twins and twins from the pre-pregnancy period. This would seem difficult, as predicting a
451 twin pregnancy is hardly possible, but many fertility clinics hold medical records on the conception of
452 twins and have the potential to create such research resources.
453 For all phenotypes, we need to consider sample sizes when applying twin methods. Is larger
454 always better, or can ‘better’ also involve phenotypes with improved reliability or designs that profit
455 from unique events? An example would be the NASA twin study that enabled the investigation of the
456 effect of long-duration spaceflight on the human body in one pair of identical twins . While
457 astronaut Mark Kelly stayed on earth, his identical twin Scott spent a year in space. Spaceflight
458 affected some bodily functions even six months after returning to earth, including gene expression
459 changes. Other changes, such as body weight and metabolite levels, were less persistent and
460 returned to the pre-flight levels after a shorter time.
461 Twin studies have helped in understanding the influence of the environment by analysing traits
462 that tend to be labelled as ‘environmental’, such as social environment, leisure-time activities, and
463 life events, indicating that with an average heritability of 49%, these ‘environmental’ variables are
464 partially under genetic control . The classical twin design is still one of the most powerful to
465 distinguish between unique and shared environmental influences. While GWAS approaches are
466 increasingly powerful to estimate, besides heritability, the bivariate genetic correlations between
467 traits, in contrast to twin studies, they do not inform on the phenotypic or environmental
468 correlations between phenotypes and do not account for the heritability of the traits. Moreover,
469 traits that show evidence of shared environment are predicted to show evidence of genetic nurture
470 in designs with non-transmitted PGSs . Results from twin studies can thus generate new
471 hypotheses about genetic nurture.
472 Twin registers often have multi-generational genotype data and a wide variety of phenotypes
473 and will continue to be essential contributors of data to GWAS, within-family designs, causality
474 modelling, intergenerational transmission, and longitudinal studies. Twin researchers mostly collect
475 twin data, though interest in twin research by other disciplines is beneficial, as every discipline has its
476 way of measuring constructs . Diverse disciplines should collaborate to ensure clarity about the
477 meaning of results, such as when a trait is reported to have high heritability . Despite rapid
478 technological advances enabling increasingly large-scale omics investigations for human complex
479 traits and the renewed interest in family-based methods, twin designs have not only contributed to
480 the major discoveries in behavioural genomics but will continue to do so .
