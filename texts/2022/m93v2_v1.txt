Employee silence research stipulates that silence requires input to share, which we posit
stems from encountering workplace events. We argue that the validity of relationships between
employee silence and outcomes is limited without taking preceding events into account:
Employees might not encounter relevant events and therefore cannot show silence. Further,
workplace events can have independent effects on the outcomes attributed to silence, potentially
confounding the effects of silence and preceding events. Drawing on an existing cross-cultural
dataset (N = 8,222 in 35 samples), we show that some samples include up to 60% of participants
who did not encounter relevant events. Using data from a German utility company (N = 572 in
129 teams), we demonstrate that the associations between employee silence and outcomes like
burnout are overestimated if effects of events are left unaccounted. Lastly, a simulation study
shows that biased silence-outcome relations are generalizable whenever events have independent
effects on the outcome of interest.

MISSING EVENTS IN SILENCE RESEARCH 2
Articles on employee silence, that is, “withholding of potentially important input or […]
instances when an employee fails to share what is on his or her mind” (Morrison, 2014, p. 174),
often describe negative events facilitated by silence, ranging from injustice over business
misconduct to accidents (e.g., Pinder & Harlos, 2001; Tangirala & Ramanujam, 2008; Whiteside
& Barclay, 2013). Silence is a conditional construct: For it to occur, employees must have
something on their mind; “having nothing meaningful to convey” (Morrison, 2014, p. 174) is not
silence. Employees who do not have input on their mind cannot exhibit silence. However, as we
explain below, the majority of studies that inquire about employees’ past silence behaviour do
not ask participants whether they had any input on their mind potentially worth sharing to begin
with.
We posit that input that employees can remain silent about stems from workplace events,
and failing to account for them on a theoretical and methodological level introduces two sources
of bias to studies of silence: First, employees who encountered no relevant events lack salient
input to share, rendering their silence scores uninterpretable. Second, many events that precede
silence (e.g., problematic work routines, injustice, incompetence, or conflicts; Brinsfield, 2013;
Milliken et al., 2003) affect the same outcomes that are often attributed to silence (e.g., Blom et
al., 2020; Robbins et al., 2012), potentially confounding the association between silence and its
consequences.
In Study 1, we use an existing dataset (Knoll et al., 2021) to demonstrate that employees
frequently lack input, and that they report silence regardless. In Study 2, we present data from an
employee survey demonstrating that controlling for the presence of preceding events diminishes
the association between silence and outcomes like burnout. A simulation in Study 3 demonstrates
that this confounding is inherent whenever events and silence affect the same outcomes.

Study 1: Ambiguous Responses in Silence Measures
Silence requires input that can be shared (Morrison, 2014). Based on Event System
Theory (EST; Morgeson et al., 2015), which states that events draw attention and initiate
information processing or changes in behaviour, we suggest that workplace events form the
foundation for silence by either giving rise to suggestions, concerns etc., or by making past input
salient again. EST’s definition of events (interactions of entities, external to the perceiver, bound
to specific place and time) covers most situations that precede silence, e.g., incompetence,
injustice, concerns about policies and working procedures, or suggestions (Brinsfield, 2013;
Milliken et al., 2003).
Conceptualizing silence as conditional on prior events providing input implies that not
encountering events makes employees unable to exhibit silence. Still, common silence scales that
ask employees whether they remained silent about suggestions, problems, inefficacies or patient
safety issues (e.g., Detert & Edmondson, 2011; Tangirala & Ramanujam, 2008; van Dyne et al.,
2003) do not ask about whether these occurred in the first place. This is problematic because
relevant input can be rare: Knoll et al. (2019) found that 30% of participants encountered no
wrong, inefficient or immoral acts of colleagues or supervisors during the past six months that
they could remain silent about (six weeks: 51-57%). Consequently, low silence scores alone are
uninterpretable, because they could reflect either a decision against silence or merely the absence
of events to remain silent about. We thus formulate two Research Foci for Study 1:
Research Focus 1: How prevalent is the absence of events employees can remain silent
about?

results before writing this manuscript, so we avoid using the terms “hypotheses” or
“research questions”.

Research Focus 2: Do employees report “no silence” if they do not encounter events?
Study 1 Method
We used data from the cross-cultural examination by Knoll et al. (2021), one of the
largest datasets including information about silence and preceding events (see
analyses (version 4.4.1; R Core Team, 2024).
Knoll et al. (2021) provided data from 8222 employees in 35 samples, but we excluded
data from Peru due to missing values about events (n = 246) and three persons with invalid
silence scores, leaving 7973 employees from 34 countries.
Participants rated how often they noticed that “colleagues or supervisors acted in a
wrong, inefficient, immoral, or otherwise problematic way” (Knoll et al., 2021, p. 626) in the last
six months (No, never; Yes, one time; Yes, a few times; Yes, many times), then rated how often
they remained silent about these events (Never, One time, Multiple times, Always).
Study 1 Results
Concerning Research Focus 1, 24.4% of participants did not encounter any event to
remain silent about (percentage by countries: M = 24.2%, SD = 13.1, Min = 0.0, Max = 60.1; see

Regarding Research Focus 2, participants disregarded the conditional nature of silence:
Of 1807 participants who did not encounter any event to remain silent about, only 59.1%

Study 1 Discussion
The data showed a mixture of valid low silence scores (event encountered, no silence by
choice) and artifactually low silence scores (no input to share, no silence by default), skewing the
distribution of silence and underlining the need for auxiliary items about event frequency for
distinguishing these two cases. Furthermore, some participants answered questions about silence
regardless of encountering events (see also Supplement S1), making it unclear what they were
silent about – possibly different issues or events further in the past than instructed.
Study 2: Demonstrating Biased Silence Effects When Event Effects Are Uncontrolled
Besides the interpretative ambiguity demonstrated in Study 1, ignoring the events
preceding silence invites biased effects of silence due to confounding. For example, silence is
positively associated with burnout (Sherf et al., 2021), but preceding events like unfairness or
problematic work routines (Brinsfield, 2013; Milliken et al., 2003) pose a risk for health and
well-being irrespective of silence (e.g., Blom et al., 2020; Robbins et al., 2012). Thus, the
relationship between silence and burnout could merely reflect the confounding presence of
events:

Study 2 Method
We use an existing dataset from a consulting project (data confidential), and focus on
emotional exhaustion / burnout due to the long-standing interest in health-related effects of
silence (e.g., Morrison & Milliken, 2000). Our sample (N = 572) stemmed from an employee
survey at a German utility company (conducted in spring/summer 2019 as the follow-up to a
2016 survey published by Zill et al., 2020). The most common age groups were 46–55 years
(29.2%), 26–35 years (24.4%), and 36–45 years (20.9%). Most participants identified as male
(65.1%, 34.5% female, 0.4% non-binary). Participants were nested within 129 teams, with an
average size of M = 4.2, SD = 3.2.
Participants described whether they encountered events like wrong, inefficient or
problematic behaviour of colleagues or supervisors in the past six months (No, never; Yes, once;
Yes, a few times; Yes, often; see Study 1), then rated the frequency of silence about these issues
(Never, Once, Often, Always). Lastly, participants rated six items for personal burnout
(Kristensen et al., 2005), for example “How often do you feel tired?” (Very rarely, Rarely,
Sometimes, Often, Very often). Scores were z-standardized.
Study 2 Results
Due to ICC(1) = .07, F(126, 361) = 1.28, p = .042, multilevel models were necessary
(fitted with lme4; Bates et al., 2015). We used silence frequency as the only predictor (Model 1),
then added event frequency (Model 2). Model 3 removed persons who never encountered

We fitted a random intercept, fixed slope model for burnout predicted by silence (Model
1; no random slopes due to singular-fit warnings). The estimated fixed effect for silence was b =
0.25, SE = 0.05, 95% bootstrap CI [0.16, 0.33]. Addressing Research Focus 3, when we added
event frequency (Model 2), the relationship between silence and burnout weakened, b = 0.18, SE
= 0.05, 95% CI [0.08, 0.29], that is, 25.87%. Also removing participants who never encountered
relevant events (Model 3) further reduced the effect of silence on burnout to b = 0.11, SE = 0.06,
95% CI [-0.00, 0.24] (53.50% decrease relative to Model 1).
Further analyses show that these findings generalise to the four differentially motivated
forms of silence described by Knoll & van Dick (2013), i.e., acquiescent, quiescent, prosocial,
and opportunistic silence, and to outcomes like satisfaction with work, organizational
identification, or turnover intentions (see Supplements S2 and S3).
Study 2 Discussion
In line with recent meta-analytic evidence (Sherf et al., 2021), we found an initial
positive association between silence frequency and burnout. However, event frequency had an
independent association with burnout, and more than a third of participants encountered no
events to remain silent about. Controlling these issues increases the validity of findings about
silence outcomes, but weakened silence effects substantially.

Study 3: Investigating the Generalizability of Biases
To show that biased silence effects occur when not controlling for events irrespective of
samples, outcomes, or measures, we ran a simulation study, also allowing us to gauge the impact
of control strategies on studies’ power.
Study 3 Method
We simulated data from different distributions for event / silence frequency (four-point
scales; see Knoll et al., 2021), used these variables to simulate an outcome (e.g., burnout) based
Supplement S4).
--------------------------------
--------------------------------
We examined 4,320 combinations of parameters – four sample sizes (N = 100, 250, 500,
1,000), 30 distributions for event/silence frequency (total sample and 29 national samples from
Knoll et al., 2021; simulated using GenOrd; Barbiero & Ferrari, 2015), three correlations
between event and silence frequency (r = .00, .10, .30), four unstandardized regression
coefficients for the event frequency effect (b = 0.00, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30), and three coefficients for
the effect of silence frequency on the outcome (b = 0.10, 0.20, 0.30). From 1,000 repetitions per
combination, we obtained average estimated silence-outcome effects and the corresponding
power.
Study 3 Results
Similarly to Study 2, we estimated the silence-outcome effect alone (Model 1), added
event frequency (Model 2), then removed “participants” who did not encounter events (Model
MISSING EVENTS IN SILENCE RESEARCH 9
3). For brevity, we limit reports to the event/silence distribution from the total sample from Knoll
analyses).
--------------------------------
--------------------------------
--------------------------------
--------------------------------
Concerning Research Focus 3, the silence-outcome relationship was biased upwards
whenever preceding events influenced the outcome. For example, with N = 1,000, r = .00
between event and silence frequency, an event frequency effect on the outcome of b = 0.10, and
a true silence frequency effect of b = 0.10, the estimated Model 1 silence frequency effect on the
outcome was b = 0.16. These biases disappeared in Models 2 and 3.
example, with N = 100, an event-outcome relationship of b = 0.10, a correlation of r = .00
between event and silence frequency, and a true silence effect of b = 0.20, the estimated Model 1
silence effect would be b = 0.26, SE = 0.07, with 92.9% power to detect it. However, power
plummets to 45.4% (b = 0.20, SE = 0.11) when controlling for event frequency and removing
“participants” who never encountered events.

Study 3 Discussion
Study 3 shows that biased silence-outcome relationships occur whenever silence is
contingent on preceding events that independently affect the outcomes attributed to silence. This
is a widespread issue because silence-related events are correlated with many outcomes like
health, motivation, or performance (e.g., Blom et al., 2020; Robbins et al., 2012).
General Discussion
We highlighted that employee silence requires input to share (Morrison, 2014), and
argued that workplace events provide this input by drawing attention to issues or by making
them salient (again). Study 1 showed that employees often lack input to share (skewing silence
distributions), and that they answer questions about silence regardless (introducing ambiguity).
Study 2 showed that ignoring the effects of preceding events can bias the relationship between
silence and outcomes, while Study 3 demonstrated the generalizability of this confounding.
Silence research in the field relies on self-report measures (Morrison, 2023) that capture
person-level tendencies of behaviour across situations (see Sherf et al., 2021), usually without
direct ties to underlying events. We recommend to always measure the frequency of events (e.g.,
Knoll et al., 2019) to check whether employees had input to share and how events are related to
outcomes. Future theories and studies should examine the mechanisms underlying the interplay
of workplace events and remaining silent about them. When planning studies, researchers should
expect weaker silence-outcome relations than in the published literature due to often
uncontrolled event-based confounding, and plan for a substantial number of exclusions due to
participants without relevant events. Practitioners should be wary of low silence scores when
event frequencies are unavailable, because no silence in the absence of events is not diagnostic
for potential communication issues.
MISSING EVENTS IN SILENCE RESEARCH 11
A limitation is that we have used known data and simulations as demonstrations, so there
was no a-priori pre-registration. Particularly our simulations allowed many degrees of freedom to
influence findings; however, we assessed a vast range of parameters to alleviate concerns that we
cherry-picked their values.
Conclusion
Concerns about aversive consequences of silence were already voiced in the first articles
on the subject (e.g., Morrison & Milliken, 2000; Pinder & Harlos, 2001). Our findings show
related pitfalls stemming from the underestimated role of preceding events, which will hopefully
inspire future research to explicitly incorporate the role of events when studying silence and its
consequences.
