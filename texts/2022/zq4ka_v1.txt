the body text of dream posts (i.e., dream reports), and nightmares were identified as dream posts whose titles included a
nonzero percentage of nightmare words. (B) Only dream-flaired posts surrounding the WHO’s declaration of COVID-19 as
a global pandemic were included in analysis. (C) Anxious dreaming – the percentage of LIWC anxiety words – increased
