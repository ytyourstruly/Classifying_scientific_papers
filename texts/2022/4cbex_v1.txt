TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 2
Abstract
The Trait Ambivalence Scale (TAS) consists of ten statements reflecting the general
tendency to feel ambivalent. The studies presented here examined the psychometric
properties, test-retest reliability, criterion validity, and concurrent validity of this
scale. Findings revealed the expected one-factor structure, good internal consistency,
and temporal consistency after four weeks. Higher scores on the TAS were positively
related to higher subjective and objective ambivalence towards various attitude
objects, establishing criterion validity. Moreover, individuals with higher TAS scores
reported more topics that they felt ambivalent about. Establishing concurrent validity,
the TAS was moderately positively related to Indecisiveness, Dialectical Thinking,
and Fear of Invalidity. The relationship with Need for Cognition was inconclusive.
The Trait Ambivalence Scale provides a valuable tool to assess individual differences
in people’s general tendency to experience ambivalence and opens up new avenues of
research into the ambivalent individual.

The Ambivalent Individual:
Validating the Trait Ambivalence Scale
In everyday life, people often encounter attitude objects they feel mixed or
conflicted about. For instance, people can love a pecan pie for its great taste, while
hating it at the same time because of its high calorie content. In these instances,
people experience ambivalence, the feeling of conflict that results from having both
positive and negative thoughts and feelings towards a single attitude object. The idea
that people can feel both positive and negative towards a single attitude object goes
back to the start of modern psychology, with Freud (1930/2015), who posited that to
be ambivalent was an intricate part of human existence. Indeed, many topics that
people care deeply about are a source of ambivalence. For instance, many people feel
ambivalent towards topics such as abortion (Alvarez & Brehm, 1995; Schneider et al.,
2015), euthanasia (Schneider et al., 2015), vegetarianism (Povey et al., 2001),
marriage (Signorielli, 1991), exercise, dieting (Sparks et al., 2004), organ donation
(Nohlen et al., 2014; Schneider et al., 2015), and their parents (Luescher & Pillemer,
1998; Maio et al., 2000).
Feeling ambivalent is not without consequences. Extensive research has
investigated the specific psychological effects of ambivalence (for an overview, see
van Harreveld, Nohlen, & Schneider, 2015), including consequences for affect (Has,
Katz, Rizzo, Bailey, & Moore, 1992; Newby-Clark, McGregor, & Zanna, 2002a;
Nordgren, van Harreveld, & van der Pligt, 2006; Nordgren et al., 2006; van
Harreveld, Rutjens, Rotteveel, Nordgren, & van der Pligt, 2009; van Harreveld, van
der Pligt, & de Liver, 2009) and information processing (Jonas et al., 1997; Nordgren
et al., 2006; Rees et al., 2013; Sawicki et al., 2013). Furthermore, the experience of
ambivalence is a key property of attitude strength (Krosnick & Petty, 1995;
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 4
Thompson et al., 1995). As such, ambivalence influences the robustness and impact of
attitudes (Bassili, 1996; Conner & Sparks, 2002). Thus, it is important to understand
when and why people feel more or less ambivalent in order to gain insight into the
psychological impact of attitudes on behavior and decision-making. So far, research
has mostly focused on properties of the underlying attitude (Priester & Petty, 1996;
Snyder & Tormala, 2017), or the evaluative context to predict the strength and impact
of ambivalent feelings (DeMarree, Briñol, & Petty, 2015; DeMarree et al., 2015;
Durso, Briñol, & Petty, 2016; Newby-Clark, McGregor, & Zanna, 2002b; Nohlen,
van Harreveld, Rotteveel, Barends, & Larsen, 2016; Schneider et al., 2013; van
Harreveld et al., 2009). Yet, there is also reason to believe that there are properties of
the person, individual differences, that play a role in how ambivalent people feel.
Examining these individual differences would further our understanding of
ambivalence in at least two ways. First, a scale measuring an individuals’ tendency to
experience ambivalence in general, or what we coin Trait Ambivalence (TA), would
allow researchers to remove variance due to individual differences in their research,
especially when using a small number of stimuli. Such a scale would thus facilitate
the examination of state-related ambivalence and its consequences. Second, and more
importantly, a Trait Ambivalence scale would enable researchers to examine new
questions about the ambivalent individual and the consequences of an ambivalent
approach to the world. However, to date there is no instrument that measures people’s
generalized experience of ambivalence. Addressing this, in this paper we provide
studies validating the Trait Ambivalence Scale (TAS).
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 5
Measuring Ambivalence Towards Specific Attitude Objects
Conventionally, attitudes are measured using bipolar scales with negative and
positive endpoints (e.g., good/bad; pleasant/unpleasant) and a neutral (e.g.,
neither/nor) midpoint (Cacioppo et al., 1997; Klopfer & Madden, 1980; Thurstone,
1928). However, such scales are unfit to assess feelings of ambivalence. Specifically,
on such scales, ambivalent feelings (such as felt towards the pecan pie from the
example above) yield a midpoint rating because people are trying to do justice to both
their negative and positive evaluations (Kaplan, 1972; Klopfer & Madden, 1980;
Thompson et al., 1995). However, a neutral or non- attitude (the absence of positivity
and negativity) also yields a midpoint rating. Thus, a midpoint rating on a bipolar
scale can either imply a state of neutrality and indifference, or the complete opposite
experience, namely ambivalence. The need to distinguish between ambivalence and
neutrality or indifference has long been a concern in ambivalence research (e.g.,
Kaplan, 1972; Priester & Petty, 1996; Schneider et al., 2016; Thompson, Zanna, &
Griffin, 1995). In trying to resolve this problem, ambivalence research has given rise
to two ways to assess ambivalence towards specific attitude objects, each of which
assesses a different facet of mixed feelings.
First, objective ambivalence focusses on the structure of the evaluations
underlying the attitude by measuring each evaluation separately (Kaplan, 1972). For
instance, in keeping with the above example, by asking respondents to “Please think
about a pecan pie. When you think about the positive [negative] aspects of a pecan
pie, how positive [negative] is your evaluation?” along two unipolar scales (“not at all
positive [negative]” to “very positive [negative]”) instead of a bipolar scale (“very
negative” to “very positive”; Kaplan, 1972; Refling et al., 2013; Thompson et al.,
1995). These ratings can be submitted to a formula that incorporates both the strength
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 6
and similarity of the ratings into one rating, e.g., ((P+N)/2)) - |P-N|, where P stands
for the positive component and N stands for the negative component (for an overview
of different formulas, see Priester & Petty, 1996). Second, subjective ambivalence is a
straightforward measure of people’s experience of ambivalence and is assessed by
directly asking people how conflicted, mixed, and indecisive they feel about a specific
attitude object (Priester & Petty, 1996).
Interestingly, correlations between objective and subjective ambivalence are
moderate at best. Previous work has estimated correlations around .40 (Priester &
Petty, 1996) and Snyder and Tormala (2017) found correlations ranging .14 to .60 in a
set of three related studies. This indicates that feelings of ambivalence are not
completely explained by the conflict between separate underlying evaluations.
Although both measures are used in research on ambivalence, downstream
consequences for affect and information processing are mostly driven by subjective
ambivalence (for an overview, see van Harreveld et al., 2015).
Evidence for Stable Differences in Ambivalence
At first sight it may seem implausible that there is a stable trait underlying the
experience of ambivalence. After all, feelings of ambivalence arise as a consequence
of having both positive and negative thoughts and feelings towards a single attitude
object (Armitage & Conner, 2000; Cacioppo & Berntson, 1994; Cacioppo et al., 1997;
Priester & Petty, 1996; Thompson et al., 1995; van Harreveld et al., 2009). As such,
ambivalence should be restricted to the specific attitude object that is being evaluated.
For instance, my feelings of ambivalence towards a pecan pie, resulting of the
realization that it is both tasty (positive) and unhealthy (negative) should not be
related to my feelings of ambivalence (or lack thereof) about nuclear energy.
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 7
However, evaluative responses to ambivalent topics show surprisingly stable
inter-individual consistency. Thompson and Zanna (1995) asked participants to rate
three or five moderately ambivalent social issues on different evaluative dimensions
(e.g., good – bad) and calculated an ambivalence score from these responses. When
treating these responses as items in a scale, they found fairly good reliability, with an
alpha level of .66 for a scale made of three ratings, and .76 for a five ratings scale.
This means that people’s evaluations were related to each other, even though the
evaluations concerned completely different attitude objects. Note however, that this
study focused on objective ambivalence, not subjective experiences of ambivalence
per se.
Additional support for the idea that there may be a stable individual difference
in the tendency to feel ambivalent comes from investigations into correlations
between ambivalence towards specific topics and different personality measures.
Specifically, individual difference measures that tap into how people process
information during decision-making seem to be related to ambivalence. For instance,
Personal Fear of Invalidity, a chronic tendency to weigh all information but being
unable to come to a decision out of the fear that one is wrong (Thompson, Naccarato,
& Parker, 1992), is positively correlated with ambivalence (Thompson & Zanna,
1995). Need for Cognition (Cacioppo & Petty, 1992), the enjoyment of thought and
complex deliberations, is found to be negatively associated with ambivalence
(Thompson & Zanna, 1995). Ambivalence has also been positively associated with
Dialectical Thinking, such that the more someone tends to tolerate conflicting beliefs,
the more this person tends to provide ambivalent responses (Hamamura et al., 2008).
Again, all these findings related mostly to differences in objective ambivalence (i.e.,
structural conflict between the positive and negative evaluations; Kaplan, 1972;
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 8
Thompson et al., 1995) rather than to subjective ambivalence (i.e., the subjective
experience of having mixed and conflicting feelings; Priester & Petty, 1996).
Perhaps the most compelling evidence comes from recent work. By using
random effect models, this research shows that there is significant variance related to
the individual, beyond the variance related to the stimuli, that accounts for the levels
of experienced ambivalence people report (Simons et al., 2018). Such an approach is
only possible when a dataset has many ratings of many stimuli, a requirement that is
not often met and does not allow for an easy and practical way to assess structural
individual differences. Yet, these findings do suggest that there may well be a
measurable latent variable that reflects people’s general tendency to experience
ambivalence.
Current Studies
In what follows, we develop a scale that assesses people’s general tendency to
feel ambivalent, the Trait Ambivalence Scale (TAS). Because the subjective
experience of feeling ambivalent is most relevant to downstream consequences for
affect, cognition, and behavior (e.g., van Harreveld et al., 2015), the TAS focusses on
this aspect of ambivalence. Thus, it follows that the TAS should first and foremost be
positively related to subjective ambivalence towards specific objects. For the sake of
comprehensiveness, we also assess objective ambivalence. Given the aforementioned
modest relationship between objective and subjective ambivalence, we expect either
no relation or a small positive relation between objective ambivalence and the TAS.
Furthermore, if it is true that individuals with higher scores on the TAS experience
more ambivalence toward specific attitude objects, logically, they should also feel
ambivalent about more topics (i.e., more topics meet the threshold for feeling
ambivalent). We will therefore also assess the number of topics people report being
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 9
ambivalent about and relate them to the TAS. This measure has the additional
advantage of not being reliant on a rating scale.
Additionally, to establish concurrent validity, we relate the TAS to different
personality characteristics that have been associated with ambivalence in past
research. Note that in these works, ambivalence was assessed with measures of
objective ambivalence. Our scale is aimed at capturing the enduring tendency to
experience ambivalence. Nevertheless, given that objective ambivalence is related to
subjective ambivalence, at least to some degree, we still expect a positive relation
with Personal Fear of Invalidity (Thompson & Zanna, 1995) and Dialectical Thinking
(Hamamura et al., 2008; Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2004), and a negative relation with
Need for Cognition (cf., Thomspon & Zanna, 1995).
Furthermore, reflecting a general consequence of ambivalence (Bargh,
Chaiken, Govender, & Pratto, 1992; Fazio, Sanbonmatsu, Powell, & Kardes, 1986;
Schneider et al., 2015; van Harreveld et al., 2009; van Harreveld et al., 2009), we
assess the relationship with the difficulty of coming to a decision, or Indecisiveness
(Rassin et al., 2007). We expect that higher ratings on the TAS are associated with
more indecision.
Development of the Trait Ambivalence Scale
We developed the Trait Ambivalence Scale by adjusting items from widely
used scales already in the literature aimed at measuring feelings of ambivalence
From the subjective ambivalence scale (Priester & Petty, 1996) we created “Many
topics make me feel conflicted” and “I often experience that my thoughts and feelings
are in conflict when I’m thinking about a topic”, reflecting the original item assessing
feelings of conflict towards a specific topic. Furthermore, from the felt ambivalence
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 10
scale (Jamieson, 1993) we created “I often feel torn between two sides of an issue”
and “Most of the time my thoughts and feelings are not necessarily in accordance with
each other”. Furthermore, reflecting the metaphorical description of the experience of
ambivalence (Schneider et al., 2013) we included “I often experience both sides of an
issue pulling on me” and “Sometimes when I think about a topic, it almost feels like I
am physically switching from side to side”. We also added three items that reflect the
simultaneous experience of positivity and negativity inherent in experiences of
ambivalence (cf. Newby-Clark et al., 2002) “I usually see both the positive as well as
the negative side of things”, “I often find that there are pros and cons to everything”,
and “My feelings are often simultaneously positive and negative”, as well as one item
reflecting the inherent contradiction in ambivalent attitudes: “My thoughts are often
contradictory“. For each item, participants were asked to indicate how much each of
the items applies to them on a 7-point scale (1= does not apply to me at all, 7=
strongly applies to me). For Study 1 and 2 we aimed to collect 200 responses. Study 3
was a dataset collected at the end of the experimental session of an unrelated project,
for which we could not make demands on sample size, that has 140 responses.
Study 1: Validation in a North American Amazon Mechanical Turk Sample
Method
Participants and Procedure. Two-hundred participants completed a 15-
minute study via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk for the reimbursement of $1.30. Two
participants were excluded because they only finished one of three questionnaires.
Moreover, when asked about their understanding of the construct of ambivalence (see
details below), 21 participants responded incorrectly. These participants were
excluded from analyses, leaving a final sample of 177 participants (49% male; M =
age
32.37, SD = 8.80; 100% native English speakers; highest education: 12% high school,
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 11
77% college, 11% master’s degree or higher; income: 18% below $20,000, 37%
between $20,000 and 60,000, 19% more than $60,000). After electronically signing
the informed consent form, they were presented with the questionnaires in the order
listed below.
Procedure and materials. Means, Standard Deviations and psychometric
Trait Ambivalence Scale as described above. Subsequently they were given a
description of what ambivalent topics are: “Ambivalent topics are topics that you have
opposing thoughts and feelings about. About these topics, you hold both negative and
positive feelings and they make you feel conflicted.” Next, participants were asked to
list topics they felt ambivalent about. We counted the number of listed topics. After
90 seconds, participants were automatically directed to the next page. As a check that
people understood the task and the kind of topics they were asked to list, we next
asked what, in their understanding, it means to be ambivalent about a topic.
Participants could choose between That you don’t really care about a topic (10%),
That you have strong, opposing feelings and feel conflicted (89%), and That you don’t
really know anything about the topic (0%), 1% missing. In the data analysis reported
below we included the 177 participants who correctly chose the second option.
Because the TAS measures a general tendency to feel ambivalent, it should be
related to feelings of ambivalence across an array of different topics. We therefore
presented participants with 20 topics that have been used in previous work on
ambivalence: abortion (Alvarez & Brehm, 1995; Nohlen et al., 2014; Schneider et al.,
2015), vegetarianism (Povey et al., 2001), dieting (Armitage & Arden, 2007; Nohlen
et al., 2014; van Harreveld, Nohlen, & Schneider, 2015), alcohol (Nohlen et al., 2014;
Schneider et al., 2015), organ donation (Nohlen et al., 2014; Schneider et al., 2015;
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 12
van Harreveld, Rutjens, Schneider, Nohlen, & Keskinis, 2014), euthanasia (Nohlen et
al., 2016; Schneider et al., 2015), GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) food (van
Harreveld, Pligt, Vries, Wenneker, & Verhue, 2004; Nohlen et al., 2014) exercise
(Sparks et al., 2004), well-fare programs, immigration (Nohlen et al., 2014), or have
been self-reported as ambivalent topics by research participants on Amazon
Mechanical Turk: affirmative action, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Facebook, gun-
control, Obama-care, legalizing marijuana, homosexuality, transgender people,
organic food (Schneider et al, unpublished data).
Objective ambivalence towards each topic was measured by asking how
positive (1= not at all positive, 7= very positive) and negative (1= not at all negative,
7= very negative) participants were about each of them (Kaplan, 1972; Thompson et
al., 1995). We calculated objective ambivalence for each topic using the following
formula: ((P + N/2)) - | P – N |, where P refers to the positive evaluation and N refers
to the negative evaluation. Then, subjective ambivalence was measured by asking
participants how conflicted, mixed, and indecisive they felt about each of the 20
topics on a 7-point scale (about this topic, 1= I feel no conflict at all/ I am
experiencing completely one sided reactions/ I feel no indecision at all, 7 = I feel
maximum conflict/ I am experiencing mixed reactions/ I feel maximum indecision,
Priester & Petty, 1996).
After this, participants filled out the Indecisiveness Scale (Rassin et al., 2007)
consisting of 101 items measuring the extent to which decisions are experienced as
discomforting. Examples include “I often worry about making the wrong decision”
and “I try to put off making decisions”. Participants were asked to rate how much
they disagree or agree with each item on a 7-point scale (1= strongly disagree, 7=
strongly agree).
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 13
The Need for Cognition Scale (Cacioppo et al., 1984) consists of 18 items
measuring the extent to which one engages in and enjoys effortful thought. Examples
include “I find satisfaction in deliberating hard and for long hours” and “I really enjoy
a task that involves coming up with new solutions to problems”. Participants were
asked to rate how false or true each item is for them on a 7-point scale (1= completely
false, 7= completely true) 2.
The Dialectical Self Scale (Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2004) consists of 32 items
measuring tolerance for contradiction and the acknowledgment that one’s behavior is
stable over time and context. Examples include “I often find that things will contradict
each other” and “I am the same around my family as I am around friends”.
Participants were asked to rate how much they disagree or agree with each item on a
7-point scale (1= strongly disagree, 7= strongly agree).
The Personal Fear of Invalidity Scale (Thompson et al., 2001) consists of 14
items measuring one’s concern for the consequences of their decisions. Examples
include “Sometimes I become impatient over my indecisiveness” and “I tend to
struggle with most decisions”. Participants were asked to rate how much they
disagree or agree with each item on a 7-point scale (1= strongly disagree, 7= strongly
agree). Finally, participants answered various demographic questions (age, gender,
native language, education, income) and were thanked and paid.
Results and Discussion
Construct validity of the Trait Ambivalence Scale: Factor structure. The
principal component factor analysis with one forced factor on all 10 items explained
above .70. The analysis identified two weaker items (“I usually see both the positive
as well as the negative side of things” and “I often find that there are pros and cons to
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 14
everything”) with factor loadings of .11 and .27, respectively. Yet, given that these
items theoretically represent ambivalence and that the internal consistency remains
high (α = .89) even when including these items, we decided to leave the scale intact.
the two items.
After four weeks, 76 participants (31% of the total sample) completed the
scale for a second time. Following Shrout and Fleiss (1979), the test-retest reliability
of the TAS was estimated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (.79), which is
considered a good value (Landis & Koch, 1977).
Criterion validity: Relationships with ambivalence towards specific
topics. We tested the correlations between the Trait Ambivalence Scale and state
Scale were positively related to subjective ambivalence. Furthermore, Trait
Ambivalence was also positively related to objective ambivalence. The correlation
between subjective and objective ambivalence was surprisingly strong in this sample,
r (175) = .70, p <.001. Notably, the number of topics participants listed as ambivalent
was also positively correlated with Trait Ambivalence. This is particularly noteworthy
because of the presumed high heterogeneity in our sample in terms of age, education,
and other background variables that may play into this measure. In sum, the TAS
showed good criterion validity.
Concurrent validity: Relationships with relevant constructs. Next, we
examined the correlations between the Trait Ambivalence Scale and other relevant
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 15
positively related to Indecisiveness, Dialectical Thinking, and Fear of Invalidity and
negatively related to Need for Cognition.
Study 2: Validation in a Dutch Student Sample
Although the heterogeneous sample of Amazon Mechanical Turk shows
promise for the generalizability for the Trait Ambivalence Scale beyond convenience
university samples (Henrich et al., 2010), most of current day research is still done
among university students. Thus, to ensure our scale is also applicable in this
population, Study 2 aimed to replicate the findings from Study 1 in a university
student sample.
Method
Participants and Procedure. A total of 204 college students from two Dutch
universities completed our study for course credit, either in the laboratory of their
school or from home4. We excluded a total of 4 participants because they did not
complete all the questionnaires (n= 2) or did not correctly respond to the question
what ambivalence means (n= 2). The final sample consisted of 200 participants (2
participants did not fill out the demographic questions; 67% University of
Amsterdam, 33% Utrecht University; 17% male; M = 20.58, SD = 2.24; 92% native
age
Dutch speakers; highest education: 86% high school, 13% bachelor’s degree, 1%
master’s degree; study enrollment: 92% social sciences; income: 98% below €20,000,
2% between €20- and 29,000). As in Study 1, participants electronically signed the
informed consent form and were presented with the questionnaires. At the end of the
study participants answered various demographic questions (age, gender, study
enrollment, native language, education, income), were thanked and debriefed.
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 16
Materials. The materials and the order of those materials were almost
identical to Study 1. Means, Standard Deviations, and psychometric properties of all
We presented participants with the 10 items of the Trait Ambivalence Scale
that we translated into Dutch (see Appendix A). Next, after providing participants
with the description of what ambivalence is, for 90 seconds they listed all the topics
that came to mind they felt ambivalent about. As in Study 1, we checked whether
participants understood what it means to be ambivalent about a topic. Most
participants choose the correct response That you have strong, opposing feelings and
feel conflicted (99%). Only two participants were incorrect choosing That you don’t
really care about a topic (0.5%), or That you don’t really know anything about the
topic (0.5%). In the analysis as detailed below we included the 200 participants who
chose the correct option.
In order to assess objective and subjective ambivalence, participants were then
presented with 20 topics (abortion, eating meat, dieting, alcohol, fast-food, organ
donation, organic food, immigrants, euthanasia, homosexuality, GMO food, positive
discrimination, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton2, exercise, Facebook, drug use, Black
Pete3, transgender people, nuclear energy). Objective and subjective ambivalence
were measured in the same way as in Study 1.
We used the Dutch versions of The Indecisiveness Scale (Rassin et al., 2007),
the Need for Cognition Scale (Pieters et al., 1987). The Dialectical Self Scale
(Spencer-Rodgers et al., 2004) and The Personal Fear of Invalidity Scale (Thompson
et al., 2001) was translated from English to Dutch by our research team.
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 17
Results and Discussion
Construct validity of the Trait Ambivalence Scale: Factor structure. The
factor structure in the Dutch sample is similar to that of the American sample in Study
1. First, the one-factor structure explained 51.3% of the variance. Second, the
majority of the items had factor loadings above .70. Identical to Study 1, two items (“I
usually see both the positive as well as the negative side of things” and “I often find
that there are pros and cons to everything”) had weaker factor loadings (.38 and .37,
respectively). However, these loadings were higher than in Study 1. Just like in Study
1, we continue our analyses while keeping the 10-item scale intact, with a good
the results dropping the two weakest items.
Criterion validity: Relationships with ambivalence towards specific
topics. As expected, Trait Ambivalence was positively related to subjective
related to objective ambivalence. Notably, in this sample, the correlation between
subjective and objective ambivalence was substantially lower than in the first study,
r(204) = .31, p < .001. Importantly, as in Study 1, Trait Ambivalence was positively
related to the number of ambivalent topics that were spontaneously reported by
participants.
Concurrent validity: Relationships with relevant constructs. As expected
and similar to Study 1, Trait Ambivalence was positively related to Indecisiveness,
Need for Cognition.
Study 3: Validation in a German Student Sample
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 18
In Study 3 we take a further step to test the generalizability of the Trait
Ambivalence Scale by assessing the scale in yet another population, namely a German
student sample. Additionally, we broaden the array of possible topics. In the previous
studies, participants responded to topics that have been shown to cause ambivalence.
However, a general tendency to be ambivalent should be exactly that, general. Thus,
TA should also influence the degree of ambivalence people experience towards an
array of topics, ranging from relatively non-ambivalent to highly ambivalent topics.
Method
The data for Study 3 were collected within the context of an unrelated
experiment, investigating the relationship between ambivalence and self-control. The
Trait Ambivalence Scale was added at the end of the experimental session.
Participants and Procedure. A total of 140 college students (25% male; M
age
= 23.22, SD = 4.23) were welcomed in the laboratory in their German university,
were seated in front of a computer and electronically signed the informed consent
form before the computerized questionnaires were presented. None of the participants
were excluded, as all participants completed all questionnaires. Because there was no
check in this study in terms of what ambivalence meant, we did not exclude any of the
participants. At the end of the study participants answered various demographic
questions (age, gender, study enrollment), were thanked, rewarded with course credit,
and debriefed.
Materials. The materials were administered in the order they are presented
below. Means, Standard Deviations, and psychometric properties of the measures are
We presented participants with the 10 items of the Trait Ambivalence Scale
translated into German (Appendix B). Because the purpose of the experiment was in
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 19
part to examine differences between ambivalent and univalent topics, participants
were then presented with 16 topics, of which eight were pretested as ambivalent
(unconditional basic income, affirmative action, abortion, refugees, headscarf ban,
embryonic stem cell research, animal testing in medical research), and eight as
relatively non-ambivalent (negative: abuse, depression, disgust, unhappiness;
positive: being in love, happiness, vacation, sunshine). Objective ambivalence was
measured in the same way as in the prior studies, but the unipolar scales for positivity
ranged from 1 (not at all positive [negative]) to 10 (very positive [negative]).
Subjective ambivalence was measured with one item that asked participants to rate the
degree to which they experienced conflicted thoughts and feelings about the topic,
with a scale ranging from 1 (does not fit at all) to 10 (fits completely).
Results and Discussion
Construct validity of the Trait Ambivalence Scale: Factor structure.
Similar to Studies 1 and 2, the one-factor structure explained 56.9% of the variance.
All items loaded convincingly on the factor with loadings above .40. The internal
consistency of the scale was excellent (α = .91).
Criterion validity: Relationships with ambivalence towards specific
topics. As expected, Trait Ambivalence was positively related to subjective and
correlated moderately in this study, r(140) = .50, p < .001. Interestingly, in this study,
Trait Ambivalence was positively correlated with subjective ambivalence both for the
ambivalent and the univalent items, showing that the tendency to be ambivalent is
general and not restricted to a priori ambivalent attitude objects, underscoring the
general nature of Trait
Ambivalence.

General Discussion
The current research examined and confirmed the reliability, construct
validity, criterion validity, and concurrent validity of the Trait Ambivalence Scale.
First, we found the expected one-factor structure with high internal consistency.
Although two items did not load highly in the first two studies, we still included them
in the scale. The presence of positive and negative evaluations is a core part of what it
means to be ambivalent and part and parcel of its definition. This theoretical
relevance, and the fact that the overall internal consistency of the scale remained
intact, justified the inclusion of these two items. Second, the scale was positively
related to feelings of ambivalence towards specific topics, as well as the number of
topics that people were ambivalent about, showing concurrent as well as criterion
validity. Third, in line with the literature on ambivalence, the Trait Ambivalence
Scale was related to more Indecisiveness, Dialectical Thinking, and Fear Of
Invalidity. Finally, these relations appeared to be quite robust and were replicated
across studies and samples.
The relationship between Trait Ambivalence and Need for Cognition was
somewhat unstable; a negative relationship was found in Study 1 and no relationship
in Study 2. Although non-significant findings are likely in a set of multiple studies
(Lakens & Etz, 2017), a more systematic explanation may be that the Dutch college
overall effect on ambivalence too small to detect in the current sample. With regards
to sample size, in typical research scenarios correlations stabilize at sample sizes of
250 participants (Schönbrodt & Perugini, 2013). Nevertheless, our samples were big
enough to produce robust findings that replicated over different studies, showing the
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 21
Trait Ambivalence Scale is able to reliably capture a significant part of the variance
involved in individuals’ experience of ambivalence.
Limitations
One possible limitation of the scale we developed is the item selection. Instead
of generating a large pool of items, we chose to select existing items that have been
shown to reliably relate to different indices of ambivalence and have robust predictive
value for downstream consequences. The advantage of this approach is that it
capitalizes on, and connects to, previous research investigating experiences of
ambivalence on a state level. However, even though we cannot rule out that there may
be alternative scale items that would perform better, the studies presented here show
that the TAS has consistently high reliability and relates robustly to other relevant
constructs.
A second limitation might be that we did not relate the TAS to any
consistency-related individual differences. Ambivalence is an inherent consistency
violation within an attitude. Potentially, this should relate negatively to the preference
for consistency (Cialdini, Trost, & Newsom, 1995; also see Newby-Clark et al.,
2002b). To address this, we conducted an additional study performed after the main
validation studies and find that individuals who score higher on the TAS tend to have
a lower preference for consistency. Details can be found in the Supplemental
Materials.
Future directions
Overall, our results indicate that a general tendency to experience ambivalence
can be measured using a brief questionnaire. As such, the Trait Ambivalence Scale
also opens up a new area of research into the ambivalent individual, where an array of
consequences of the ambivalent personality can be explored. For instance, recent
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 22
work has shown that induced ambivalence can increase efficiency in decision-making
(Guarana & Hernandez, 2016; Rees et al., 2013; Rothman et al., 2017), and aid in
emotion regulation ( Reich & Wheeler, 2016). Perhaps these downstream
consequences are also associated with individual differences in feelings of
ambivalence. Indeed, in our own lab we have found evidence that higher scores on the
Trait Ambivalence Scale are associated with a lower tendency to fall prey to the
fundamental attribution error (Schneider et al., 2021).
Additionally, further exploration of the Trait Ambivalence Scale and well-
researched consequences of induced state ambivalence can generate new insights into
the relationship between ambivalence and negative affect. Extant research has
established that ambivalence gives rise to negative affect (Hass et al., 1992; Nordgren
et al., 2006; van Harreveld et al., 2009; van Harreveld, Schneider, Nohlen, & van der
Pligt, 2012; van Harreveld et al., 2015, 2009). This might suggest that people who are
more ambivalent than others, and about more things, might suffer from more negative
affect as well. However, research on mixed feelings in the domain of emotions shows
that more instances of ambivalence over longer periods of time is associated with
more well-being (Adler & Hershfield, 2012) and better health (Hershfield et al.,
2013). Resolving this paradox will shed new light on the workings of the positive and
negative effects of feeling ambivalent.
Finally, the Trait Ambivalence Scale can also be used to parse out variance in
research focused on examining ambivalence towards specific topics, or specific
situations. Previous work has focused on how personality traits distinct from
ambivalence, but related to information processing styles and decision-making,
influence experiences of ambivalence. Here we directly assessed the chronic tendency
to feel ambivalent and related it directly to the attitude specific measurements of
TRAIT AMBIVALENCE SCALE 23
ambivalence. As such, the short self-report scale presented here allows researchers to
understand the systematic noise that these individual differences normally introduce
validate into research, thereby being better able to understand state related feelings of
ambivalence.
In sum, we present here a short scale to measure general tendencies to feel
ambivalent that can be administered in a simple and straightforward way. The scale
shows good internal consistency and is related to feelings of ambivalence towards
different topics as well as the number of topics people are ambivalent about, both in
student samples and in more heterogeneous samples, as well as in Dutch, German,
and Unites States American participants. Our scale offers researchers a new tool to
further investigate and understand the ambivalent individual.
