Abstract
Working in academia is challenging, even more so for those with limited resources and
opportunities. Researchers around the world do not have equal working conditions. The
paper presents the structure, operation method, and conceptual framework of the SM3D
Portal’s community coaching method, which is built to help Early Career Researchers
(ECRs) and researchers in low-resource settings overcome the obstacle of inequality and
start their career progress. The community coaching method is envisioned by three science
philosophies (cost-effectiveness, transparency spirit, and proactive attitude) and
established and operated based on the Serendipity-Mindsponge-3D knowledge (SM3D)
management framework (i.e., mindsponge thinking and Bayesian Mindsponge Framework
analytics serve as the coaching program’s foundational theory and analytical tools). The
coaching method also embraces Open Science’s values for lowering the cost of doing
science and encouraging the trainees to be transparent, which is expected to facilitate the
self-correcting mechanism of science through open data, open review, and open dialogue.
Throughout the training process, members are central beneficiaries by gaining research
knowledge and skills, acquiring publication as the training’s product, and shifting their
mindsets from “I can’t do it” to “I can do it,” and at the same time transforming a mentee to
be ready for a future mentor’s role. The coaching method is thus one of the members, for
the member, by the members.

1. Method details
In this article, we aim to present a community coaching platform that is built to support
Early Career Researchers (ECRs) and researchers in low-resource settings in doing
community coaching method envisioned by three science philosophies of transparency
(Vuong, 2020a), cost-effectiveness (Vuong, 2018), and proactiveness (Vuong, 2019). It has
operated based on the SM3D (Serendipity-Mindsponge-3D) knowledge management
system (Vuong, Le et al., 2022). The framework is constituted by the mindsponge theory
(Vuong, 2023; Vuong & Napier, 2015), serendipity theory (Vuong, 2022c), the bayesvl
package (La & Vuong, 2019), and the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) analytics
(Nguyen, La, Le, & Vuong, 2022a, 2022b; Vuong, Nguyen, & La, 2022). Before delving into
the structure, operation method, and conceptual framework of the SM3D Portal’s
community coaching method, it is essential to understand the reasons for the platform’s
development.
Fierce competition in academia and evaluating academics based on publication and citation
metrics are generally challenging for all researchers. “Publish or perish” is a well-known
maxim representing in stark terms the pressure academics face to publish to advance their
career (El Halabi et al., 2021). The pressure appears more striking for early career
researchers (ECRs) and researchers in low-resource countries, for they are usually
deprived of guidance and lack resources, experience, and knowledge (Callier & Polka,
2015). As a result, they usually encounter multiple setbacks, central to which are mental
distress and career dropout.
On the job search front, since it is not easy for ECRs to obtain tenure in their early career
stage, they might work multiple successive fixed-term contracts or physically relocate to
take up employment opportunities (Fisher & James, 2022). The ongoing precarity can
cause anxiety and hurt their ability to maintain career momentum and trajectory. Another
culprit of ECRs is possible career dropout. This occurs because, despite efforts, ECRs
sometimes cannot publish their work due to their failure to pass rigorous review coupled
with a low rate of acceptance by highly indexed journals or lack of experience impacted by
their little exposure to avenues available for publication. Prolonged stress, burnout, and
limited job opportunities by a global stagnation in academic positions accompanied by an
increase in Ph.D. graduates (Ghaffarzadegan, Hawley, Larson, & Xue, 2015) can overrule
the resilience of researchers, which, in turn, can lead to their decision to quit academic
careers.
These repercussions have been exaggerated when the budget for scientific research is
being cut globally (in both developing and developed countries), and the cost of doing
science is getting more costly. Conducting research incurs many expenses, such as
professional fees, field schedules fees, costs associated with laboratory experiments, and
subscription fees to databases. Other costs during the publication of scientific work include
editing services, article processing charges, and open access fees. These are not easily
affordable, especially for ECRs and researchers from low-income countries with limited
funds.
The situation is further deteriorated by pervasive budget cuts worldwide. In one instance,
Guglielmi (2019) reported that Mexico’s chronically underfunded science now suffered a
broader cost-cutting measure leading to the dismissal of researchers in many institutions;
alternatively, researchers themselves needed to run crowdfunding campaigns. Budget cut
also fuels frustration among academics in advanced countries such as Japan and Australia
(Editorial, 2017; Mallapaty, 2019), so collaborating with peers in developed countries to
access more resources seems less feasible for researchers in developing countries (Nguyen
& Vuong, 2021). Thus, costly scientific work and its publication, coupled with declining
funding rates, create an environment where ECRs and researchers in low-resource settings
face higher risks than ever before (Maher & Anfres, 2016).
At the same time, there is an ongoing concern about scientific misconduct due to pressure
from publication metrics fulfillment. Prevalent general science misconduct includes, but is
not limited to, fabricated data, paper mills, and data manipulation. This sent a shockwave to
the public when many prestigious organizations and journals conducted the retraction of
papers due to fraud or suspected fraud (Fang, Steen, & Casadevall, 2012). In one instance,
Nobel Prize winner Gregg Semenza has retracted four papers from the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) for concerns about images in the articles (Oransky,
2022a). Apart from PNAS, Nature, Science, and the New England Journal of Medicine have
also faced massive retraction incidents. Another instance is that the Institute of Electrical
and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) has recently retracted 400 peer-reviewed articles
(Oransky, 2022b). In the same vein, social science and psychology, in particular, also face
their issues, described as reproducibility crises and discussed in some studies, such as the
ones by Camerer et al. (2018) and Nosek et al. (2015).
Given the deteriorating situation of scientific misconduct as well as the pressure and
deprivation of resources borne by ECRs and low-resource-setting researchers, one of the
platform founders has proposed his opinions on many prestigious scientific journals (e.g.,
Nature, Nature Human Behaviour, and Learned Publishing) and scientific forums (e.g., LSE
Impact Blog, Scientific Data Updates, and Times Higher Education) (Vuong, 2017, 2018,
2019, 2020a, 2020b, 2022a, 2022b).
Specifically, the foundational philosophy suggests that research integrity can be enhanced
in many ways, from open science to self-critique and other practices, which should then be
well communicated to ERCs in the early stage of their career. Indeed, an open review
system helps facilitate a transparent discovery process, leading to significant social benefits
and improving public trust in science (Nosek et al., 2015). In addition, ECRs or researchers
in developing countries can still progress in low-resource settings if they acquire a
proactive attitude, cost-effectiveness consideration, and self-correcting spirit. These
science philosophies have given birth to the SM3D Portal and invigorated it during its
operation. The following section will present more details about how Vuong’s science
philosophies have shaped and invigorated the platform.
Taking into account obstacles encountered by ECRs and researchers from developing
countries, the SM3D Portal was established to provide a platform to support them through
on-the-job coaching activities using the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework analytics method
and allow them to communicate and exchange knowledge. Since its foundation on 22nd June
2022, the SM3D Portal has been training 10 ECRs and low-resource-setting researchers
affiliated with institutions in Australia, China, Ethiopia, Fiji, Netherlands, New Zealand, and
Vietnam. The training has led to not only the improvement in their research skills and
publishing experience but also the completion of seven manuscripts, of which one was
successfully published after four months (Nguyen, Khuc, et al., 2022).
Therefore, this paper aims to present the SM3D Portal’s method-based pedagogical
approach to assist ECRs and researchers from low-resource settings, hoping the model can
be expanded and replicated. Our paper begins by laying out the background and
motivations for supporting ECRs and researchers in low-resource settings. It will then
discuss the coaching design or how the community coaching platform works. Afterward,
we embark on the conceptual framework upon which the ECRs coaching is built. To
elaborate, we explain how the platform creates an environment that can shift trainees’
mindsets from “I can’t do it” to “I can do it.” The final part draws upon future directions.
2. Coaching design
2.1. Platform overview: Trainees as central beneficiaries
The coaching is executed via an online platform named SM3D Portal. Mindsponge thinking
and BMF analytics play the backbone theory and analytical tools in the coaching program.
The Portal’s name roots from its establishment based on the Serendipity-Mindsponge-3D
knowledge management framework, and it is freely accessible at
in detail and linked to the related publications for references. The platform was initially
created on 7th April and has been officially operated since 22nd June 2022 by the AISDL
team. The team is also the creators of the mindsponge theory (Vuong, 2023), the
serendipity theory (Vuong, 2022c), the bayesvl R package (La & Vuong, 2019), and the BMF
analytical approach (Nguyen, La, et al., 2022a, 2022b).
The platform aims to train and improve the research and publication skills of ECRs, which
is specified in three major objectives:
(i) Promote knowledge exchange and facilitate worldwide collaboration based on
openness, transparency, equality, and innovation;
(ii) Create opportunities for researchers, especially ECRs and those from the low-
resource background, to participate in joint research projects utilizing the BMF
analytics; and,
(iii) Allow participants to discuss interesting findings, achieve products, and gain
useful research skills with the core team’s theoretical, technical, and editorial
Through the platform, the team aims to create collaborative projects in which trainees are
the main beneficiaries by:
1) Improving research knowledge and skills via rich experiences shared by the AISDL
members who have (co)authored hundreds of peer-review research articles in a
variety of disciplines, as well as serving as editors and reviewers of hundreds of
other articles and books;
2) Honing research skills and gaining confidence through the “learning-by-doing”
process (i.e., practicing conducting study and writing manuscripts in real projects).
It is not a theoretical class lesson per se, but the participants will be joining a
collaborative project, from the initial conceptualization step to the final response-
to-reviewer process; and
3) enhancing the participants’ visibility via publications as a result of the training
process. The publication must be a peer-reviewed journal, book chapter, or book
(preferably indexed in major bibliographical databases, such as the Web of Science
Throughout the training project, all the project members (trainees included) are
considered collaborators who contribute to sharing ideas and completing the assigned
tasks under the clear and reasonable guidance of the mentor from the AISDL team.
Although the project mentor gives the directions and tasks of the project, the members are
equally contributing to open discussions with the mentor to improve their understanding
of the conceptual framework and fundamental theories behind the project scheme, which is
sometimes not close to the trainees’ expertise. Moreover, all participants are equally
credited, and their efforts will be valued appropriately through their actual contribution
throughout project implementation.
The most recent achievement of the coaching platform is making the first product co-
authored by our members published in a qualified journal after four working months: the
Journal of Risk and Financial Management (JRFM) (Nguyen, Khuc, et al., 2022). The journal
is indexed in both Scopus and Web of Science databases. According to the ABDC Journal
Quality List, issued by the Australian Business Deans Council, JRFM is rated B rank
(belonging to the top 27.6% of 2,682 qualified journals). The journal is also affiliated with
various scholarly societies, such as the International Engineering and Technology Institute
(IETI), the Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (IDSAI), and the International
Research Institute for Economics and Management (IRIEM). It should also be noted that
the article’s Article Processing Charge (APC) was entirely handled by the team using the
APC waiver of one of the team members.
2.2. Philosophies behind the coaching platform
The coaching design is envisioned by three core science philosophies: cost-effectiveness,
transparency spirit, and proactive attitude (Vuong, 2018, 2019, 2020a). A cost-effective
mindset and proactive attitude can help researchers strive in low-resource conditions. At
the same time, the transparency spirit can contribute to reducing the cost of doing science
and facilitating the self-correcting mechanism of science (Vuong, 2017). The intertwining
of these philosophies can be easily observed through the platform operation and
participant training methods.
The coaching activities are built to guide trainees to conduct research using BMF
analytics. To lower the cost of participating in the training, the team has the resources used
for conducting research freely open, from the statistical software to the datasets.
Specifically, the bayesvl package was created on the open-source R platform, allowing all
researchers to utilize it for Bayesian inference for free (La & Vuong, 2019). The package’s
guiding protocol and a brief version of BMF analytics are also published as open-access
articles in MethodsX for free accessibility to the content (Nguyen, La, et al., 2022b; Vuong et
al., 2020). In addition to the method, the team’s materials are also submitted to data
journals, such as Scientific Data, Data in Brief, and Data (Ho et al., 2019; Nguyen, 2021;
Nguyen, Ho, Nguyen, & Vuong, 2019; Vuong, 2016; Vuong, La, et al., 2021; Vuong et al.,
2018), or deposited to open repositories, such as The Open Science Framework (OSF), to
make it widely accessible and to enhance the reusability of the resources.
During the training process, the team encourages participants to adopt a
transparency spirit and a proactive attitude to make use of secondary data available in data
journals (e.g., Scientific Data, Data Intelligence, Data in Brief, and Data), open data sharing
platforms, and reliable open repositories (e.g., Mendeley Data, Havard Dataverse, Open
Science Framework, Zenodo, Science Data Bank, etc.).
To nurture the trainees’ transparency spirit, the team also uploads the completed
manuscripts to preprint servers and announces them on the coaching platform, along with
making the method and data open. By doing so, the team expects to receive early public
feedback on the study quality for polishing before the official publication. Besides, in each
research project, the team strives to make all the relevant codes and data used for
conducting the study available in online repositories to encourage reproduction,
reevaluation, and reuse. For example, some of the latest collaborative projects and their
codes and data are deposited in the OSF Preprints and PsyArXiv Preprints:
The three science philosophies are also expressed clearly through the design of the trained
method of the coaching platform: the BMF analytics. With the following characteristics,
BMF analytics can help researchers work effectively and efficiently with limited resources
and promote open science (Nguyen & Vuong, 2022).
First, BMF analytics is not a data-intensive method. As the analytics is the combination of
mindsponge theory and Bayesian inference, it inherits the estimation power of Bayesian
inference when the priors are correctly specified (McNeish, 2016; Uusitalo, 2007) and the
reasoning strength of mindsponge theory based on set theory logic to improve the
precision of prior specification (Vuong, Nguyen, et al., 2022). These advantages allow
researchers to work well with small sample-size datasets.
Second, the method allows users to capitalize on secondary data available in data journals
and online repositories. The mindsponge theory’s generalization and flexibility in
explaining human psychology and behaviors allow users to reconstruct used datasets to
explore the studied phenomenon more deeply or reexamine the subject from the
information-processing perspective. In addition, with its fundamental feature of treating all
properties probabilistically and the assistance of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms (Dunson, 2001; Gill, 2014; Lunn, Jackson, Best, Thomas, & Spiegelhalter, 2012),
Bayesian inference can help users fit various types of models, ranging from parsimonious
to highly hierarchical models (Cowles, 2013; Wagenmakers et al., 2018). This capability of
BMF analytics has been tested and validated by several studies reusing materials in data
journals for more in-depth research (Nguyen, 2021; Nguyen et al., 2019; Nguyen & Jones,
2022a, 2022b; Nguyen et al., 2021; Vuong, Nguyen, & Le, 2021b). Two recent collaborative
projects with trainees also employed datasets not designed and collected by the AISDL
team, namely:
- “Mindsponge-based investigation into the non-linear effects of threat perception
and trust on recycled water acceptance” employed the dataset of Vila-Tojo et al.
(2022b) and shed light on the non-linear relationships between threat
perception, trust, and recycled water acceptance for drinking. The dataset had
been used in the study of Vila-Tojo et al. (2022a) earlier.
- “Examining the influence of generalized trust on life satisfaction across different
education levels and socioeconomic conditions using the Bayesian Mindsponge
Framework,” which employed the dataset of Martínez (2019) and argued that
generalized trust might have different impacts on life satisfaction across
education levels and socioeconomic conditions. The dataset had been used in the
study of Martínez, Estrada, and Prada (2019) earlier.
For completing the training process, participants are encouraged to adopt a proactive
attitude. Specifically, when giving tasks to trainees, the mentor focuses solely on
communicating the project’s core ideas and directions to complete the tasks but not exactly
what to do. Doing so gives trainees the freedom to explore new knowledge and proactively
apply creative thinking when completing tasks. Later, the mentor will validate the
knowledge and thoughts and give feedback to the trainees. Additionally, a strict deadline is
vital to maintain self-responsibility, discipline, and teamwork productivity during a project.
Therefore, the mentor and trainees reach an agreement on the deadline for the task to be
completed at the beginning of the project. Then, the mentor is in charge of keeping track of
the task progress and deadline, while trainees are responsible for completing the given
task by the deadline.
3. Exemplary training process
During the training process, each trainee is assigned a particular task along with the
direction to finalize the given task by the mentor. Such tasks can be writing the literature
review, doing the analysis, describing the materials or method, presenting the results,
and/or adding more ideas to the discussion. To demonstrate the training process more
clearly, we summarize how we guide our trainees to perform the Bayesian analysis and
result presentation in the recently finalized project: “Exploring factors contributing to
creativity performance among entrepreneurs using the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework.”
In the first step, we selected a trainee with relevant background and willingness to learn
more about analytical knowledge. The selected trainee was later provided with an
overview of the project and asked whether he/she was interested in joining the project and
conducting the Bayesian analysis. We would not disclose the trainee’s identity due to
privacy issues. However, more details about the trainee will be given upon reasonable
request and the trainee’s acceptance.
After the trainee accepted to take on the Bayesian analysis task, the mentor (M.-H.N.)
provided the trainee with the provided data and codes employed to perform the Bayesian
analysis tasks, along with the instruction. The instruction includes:
1) How to use the data to proxy the studied subjects (e.g., entrepreneurs’ creativity,
information within the entrepreneurs’ minds, and information from beyond the
entrepreneurs’ minds),
2) How to construct and fit the models using the bayesvl package, and
3) How to present the results in a transparent, logical and concise way.
The mentor ran the codes several times to ensure that the code operated well before
sending them to the trainee. For pedagogical purposes, the code was separated into four
steps with a clear explanation for each step: 1) preparing the data, 2) constructing the
model, 3) fitting the model, and 4) visualizing the results and diagnoses. The mentor also
provided the trainee with appropriate reading materials to understand the code and its
meaning and encouraged the trainee to proactively ask questions to which the answers
cannot be found in the provided materials. For example, the Bayesian analysis protocol
using bayesvl was sent to the trainee (Vuong et al., 2020); the mentor indicated the
sections containing information that helped answer the trainee’s questions in the
methodological book (Vuong, Nguyen, et al., 2022). The trainee used the following code
snippet to prepare the data and construct Model 4 in the study:

cat(model_string)
The trainee could check whether the model was correctly constructed using the
bvl_bnPlot() function, which displayed the logical network of the built model.
# display the logical network
bvl_bnPlot(model4)
* * * Visualized logical network of Model 4 * * *
Then, the trainee could use the following code snippet to fit the model and present the
estimated results.
# fit the model using appropriate technical parameters
model4 <- bvl_modelFit(model4, dat, warmup = 2000, iter = 5000, chains = 4)
# present estimated results

One of the fundamental steps in interpreting Bayesian inference results is using trace plots,
Gelman-Rubin-Brooks plots, and autocorrelation plots to diagnose the convergence of the
estimated results. Therefore, the mentor also provided the trainee with the code snippets
to visualize those plots.
For visualizing trace plots:
# visualize trace plots
bvl_plotTrace(model4)
* * * Visualized Model 4’s trace plots * * *
For visualizing Gelman-Rubin-Brooks plots:
# visualize Gelman-Rubin-Brooks plots
bvl_plotGelmans(model4, row = 3, col=2)
* * * Visualized Model 4’s Gelman-Rubin-Brooks plots * * *
For visualizing autocorrelation plots:
# visualize autocorrelation plots
bvl_plotAcfs(model4, row=3, col = 2)
* * * Visualized Model 4’s autocorrelation plots * * *
Displaying the parameters’ posterior distributions and credible intervals is the main
strength of Bayesian inference. Thus, the mentor provided the trainee with the code
snippet to plot Model 4’s posterior distributions and their credible intervals at 89%.
# visualize posterior distributions with credible intervals
bvl_plotParams(model4, 2, 3, credMass = 0.89)
* * * Visualized Model 4’s posterior distributions with credible intervals * * *
After the trainee had successfully constructed and fitted all the models (there are four
models in total), the mentor continued to instruct the trainee on how to present those
results in the manuscript and recommended the trainee some definitive studies for
reference (Nguyen et al., 2021; Vuong, Nguyen, & Le, 2021a). More details of the study’s
4. The conceptual framework
In this section, we employ the mindsponge theory and BMF analytics to construct a
conceptual framework explaining how we create an environment that helps shift trainees’
mindsets from “I can’t do it” to “I can do it.” The whole mindset-shifting process includes
three stages: 1) the beginning stage, 2) the transitional stage, and 3) the final stage.
3.1. Beginning stage
For ECRs and low-resource researchers, their collective belief system prior to the training
is mainly “I can’t do it” due to many setbacks impeding their professional development. The
low-resource context in developing countries is a major obstacle for many researchers,
especially ECRs, to progress in their academic careers. They lack mentors, funding,
literature, and research writing skills (Nchinda, 2002). Their publishing-related knowledge
is also limited, so their research practices do not often meet the international standards of
scientific conduct and ethics, and they can be easily ripped off by “predatory journals”
(Jones, 2015).
Even for ECRs in developed countries, despite being able to access funding, many still face
difficulties, such as insufficient support and research impairment due to the fierce
competition. McAlpine and Amundsen (2015) indicate two types of challenges that ECRs
usually encounter: day-to-day challenges (e.g., caused by failed experiments and the
unpredictable nature of scientific work) and longer-term challenges (e.g., institutional and
societal factors-caused challenges such as unsupportive supervisors and ill-connectedness
to department structures). The COVID-19 lockdown also exacerbated the research
impairment of ECRs as they could not practice their research skills during the data
collection process (Byrom, 2020).
Altogether, insufficient support and resources lead to low academic recognition and
publishing struggles for ECRs and low-resource-setting researchers. Meanwhile,
governments’ and institutions’ resource allocation (e.g., funding, promotion, and tenure)
based on academics based on publication and citation metrics also greatly hinder ECRs’ and
low-resource-setting researchers’ opportunities to improve their academic records and
worsen their publishing struggles. Nicholas et al. (2017) imply that, on average, ECRs could
only be named as the first author for one-third to one-half of academic papers they
contributed to and did not have much influence on which journal to submit their papers.
Given that the infosphere in which a person lives substantially influences his/her mindset,
such a fierce-competitive and limited-resource environment can easily inject the thinking
among ECRs and researchers before participating in the SM3D Portal’s community
coaching.
3.2. Transitional stage
The SM3D Portal attempts to create an environment where ECRs and low-resource
researchers can see and capitalize on the opportunities to grow and continue to nurture
their motivations to thrive. In other words, the platform provides them with direct support
to change their pessimistic infosphere to a more optimistic one. The mindset-shifting
process can be separated into three steps:
1) In the first step, the AISDL team will give ECRs, and low-resource researchers
access to navigational and useful information and gain the opportunity to grow
(Vuong, 2022c). For example, the team will provide potential research directions
to new trainees by inviting them to participate in research projects suitable for
their careers. Moreover, they are guided to create academic profiles on important
scholarly databases (e.g., Scopus, Web of Science, ORCID, Google Scholar, and
ResearchGate) and familiarize themselves with useful scientific research tools (e.g.,
R software, Microsoft Office, Zotero, and Drawio).
2) In a research project, they will be coworking with mentors to hone their research
skills, gain confidence when performing their tasks, and receive immediate support
from the mentor. All the information is provided to the trainees little by little
through the collaborative process, including the advanced theoretical and technical
supports for performing Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) analytics. When
the manuscripts are finalized, the trainees will have a chance to experience
working with preprint servers and different publishing systems and gain more
journal-submission-related knowledge and skills (e.g., journal-specific format-
adjusting, reviewer-feedback-based modification, evaluation of reviewer’s
comments, and methods responding to reviewers).
3) The training process is only considered completed when the manuscript is
successfully published in a peer-review journal, preferably in the Scopus and Web
of Science databases (for increased visibility). Sometimes, a trainee needs several
training rounds to gain confidence and acquire sufficient knowledge and skills for
conducting research independently.
Based on our training experience, there is also a possibility that trainees’ mindsets bounce
back to the low-confidence stage after multiple publications in academic journals. To
elaborate, after several successful publications with the help of mentors and the
contribution of other teammates, trainees were likely to overestimate their actual research
capabilities and become arrogant. The arrogance makes them think that conducting
research is easy. As a result, they became frustrated when facing publishing and
recognition problems again. Eventually, those trainees became panic and lost confidence
rapidly, shifting their mindsets back to the initial stage.
3.3. Final stage
The final stage solidifies trainees’ “I probably can do it” mindsets and turns them into “I can
do it” mindsets. Trainees reach this stage (or have a manuscript officially published) when
they have already acquired the skills and sufficient knowledge to meet the standard of
scientific conduct and ethics, so they are encouraged to conduct independent research. The
research skill sets and publishing experience will make trainees more competitive in
academia and have more chances to get recognized and promoted.
Trainees at this stage would also undergo an inevitable experience: many manuscript
rejections. However, such rejections are treasures for the trainees to grow. When an ECR or
researcher in low-resource setting work alone, a rejection will harm his/her confidence
and increase the doubt over his/her study’s values and research abilities. On the contrary,
when in the community coaching system, the mentor will evaluate the rejection notice and
explain to the trainees the possible reasons behind the rejection. Manuscript rejection does
not always associate with the manuscript’s quality; instead, it could also stem from the
journal’s scope, the editor’s biases, research values, and the journal’s political correctness.
Through those experiences, the mentor will also elucidate how science’s filtering and self-
correcting systems work. As a result, trainees will gain more knowledge about the
publishing system and recognize the weaknesses for self-improvement.
This perception about the values of rejection comes from one of our team’s saying:
“We celebrate less on victory; we celebrate more on the
failure that helps us recognize our weakness.”
5. Future directions
Working in academia is challenging, and academic work, to some people, can be
unnecessarily costly due to inequality issues. Thus, the SM3D Portal offers a community
coaching method to support Early Career Researchers (ECRs) and researchers in low-
resource settings in doing research using BMF analytics. The method is envisioned and
designed following three core science philosophies: cost-effectiveness, transparency spirit,
and proactive attitude.
Although the coaching method has acquired several outcomes supporting ECRs and low-
resource researchers, it still has limitations. Increasing the number of trainees, the trainees’
backgrounds, and training quality require more human and financial resources, which are
not currently available.
Training and recruiting more qualified mentors through the coaching process is an
effective method for increasing human resources. Successful trainees are invited to join the
SM3D Portal to become mentors who would later support more ECRs and low-resource
researchers in the beginning stage. Since mentor-to-be trainees had the feeling and
thinking of being ECRs or researchers in a low-resource context, they would understand
the new trainees’ difficulties and needs well. When becoming a part of the community
coaching platform, they will have the willingness, knowledge, and experience to offer help
and support.
For enhancing trainees’ recognition and promoting science, publishing in Open Access is
preferable. Nevertheless, paying the Article Processing Charge (APC) requires a substantial
amount of finance. Although the AISDL team manages to use waivers and discount coupons
(acquired through serving as editors and peer-reviewers) to pay for the trainees’ APC, it is
largely insufficient, especially when the number of trainees increases. Establishing a
resource pool for pure academic pursuits with APC settlement or any required services
from “angel investors” or science funding agencies is feasible, freeing the trainees from
unnecessary financial concerns.
