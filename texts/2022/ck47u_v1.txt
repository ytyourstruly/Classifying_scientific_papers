Can theorizing the symbiosis between a dictator and suicide attackers make sense?

This short piece is a pure theoretical inquiry following my thoughts presented in [1-2]. The
question comes into existence naturally because it logically follows the conclusions of [1] and [2].
Through my examination, such theorizing of the existence of such symbiosis does not conflict with
the results of [3], either.
Nonetheless, the explanatory exercise will depend on how the mindsponge processes [4] can be
employed to establish the relationship between the religion-like properties a dictator might wish to
institutionalize and the faith-based pursuits of the targeted people tending to trigger extreme
violence. My wild guess is that such usage will need to enable the accidental inciting of lies and
violence, as shown by [5] while shifting the focus to the intentional use of lies and violence as the
means of fast convergence to the religion-like faith in the dictator-to-be. Such mindsponge
processes will highly likely make use of some degree of cultural additivity [6].
For the time being, the thought presented in the preceding lines is purely hypothetical, or a guess, if
you like to put it that way. However, the nature of the mindsponge process will lead to the
possibility of bringing our BMF analytics's power into further investigation, and I can hardly rule
out the probability that empirical evidence will be obtained following this approach.
Given the preceding reasoning, I tend to assess that the theorizing makes sense. And this question,
combined with the conceptual approach described above, could potentially lead to a fruitful
investigation, hopefully resulting in useful insights.
I sincerely hope our research team will be able to manage our research workload and have
sufficient time to tackle this challenging but rewarding research hypothesis.
