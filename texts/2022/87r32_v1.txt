Abstract
Unbiased individual unconsciousness is a methodology that employs non-parametric receiver
operating characteristics and Bayesian analyses to provide estimations for thresholds for
subjective visual suppression. It can enable a researcher to define among brief durations (e.g.,
8.33 or 16.67 or 25 ms), per participant and elicitor type, the threshold of presentation for which
each participant is individually unconscious during masking. The outcomes of this method are
then used in a subsequent experimental session that involves psychophysiological assessments
and participant ratings to explore evidence for unconscious processing and emotional
responsivity. Following collegial requests for a dedicated manuscript on the rationale and
replication of this method, in this manuscript, we provide a thorough, comprehensive and
reader-friendly tutorial-guide. We include empirical illustrations, open-source and ready-to-
use methodological, mathematical and statistical coding scripts and step-by-step instructions
for replicating this methodology. We discuss the potential contributions and the developing
applications of individual unconsciousness in topical research.
Introduction
Empirical research on the unconscious is an area in which researchers have provided
an abundance of fascinating results and impassioned refutations. It is a research area involving
intense, unrelenting and unresolved academic debates. Research in the unconscious was
contentious since its “first steps” (Ebbinghaus,1908; Field, Aveling & Laird, 1922; Miller,
1942; Kahn, 1943; Fechner, 1948; Goldiamond, 1958; for an overview see Tsikandilakis, Bali,
Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019) to its – so to speak – “mid-life crisis” (Burnham, 1967; Dixon,
1971; 1981; Goodkin & Phillips, 1980; Merikle & Cheesman, 1987; Frosh, 1989; Bornstein,
1989; for an overview see Tsikandilakis, Bali, Yu, Madan, Derrfuss, Chapman & Groeger,
2021) and has grown methodologically contentious, now, more than ever, among contemporary
psychologists (see Bar & Biederman, 1998; Erdelyi, 2005; Pessoa & Adolphs, 2010; Elgendi,
Kumar, Barbic, Howard, Abbott & Cichocki, 2018; for an overview see Tsikandilakis et al.,
2022d).
The reasons for this topical discontent have been attributed to how different our
empirical outcomes for unconscious processing are and how polemically the believers and
disbelievers of these outcomes hold on to their theses and antitheses (Pessoa & Adolphs, 2010;
Stafford, 2014). Several scholars explored as best they could the scientific causes of the topical
discontent (Stanislaw & Todorov, 1999; Erdelyi, 2005; Dienes, 2014; 2015; 2016). They
identified potential problems and attempted to provide potential resolutions (see van der Ploeg,
Brosschot, Versluis & Verkuil, 2017).
The problems that scholars recognized as regards the empirical exploration of the
unconscious were numerous. These included several issues, such as the use of biased metrics
for the assessment of perception during visual suppression (Stanislaw & Todorov, 1999; Zhang
& Mueller, 2005; Swets, 2014; Hautus, Macmillan & Creelman, 2021) and the use of
inconclusive statistical procedures for inferring whether participants were unconscious of
visually suppressed stimuli (Dienes, 2014; 2015; 2016; Kruschke& Liddell, 2018; Heck et al.,
2022). These also spanned to other issues, such as the use of potentially unreliable methods for
implementing psychophysics-related image processing manipulations, the type of masking
applied to visually suppressed stimuli, and the unresolved problem of failing to achieve
unbiased evidence for unconsciousness using static durations of presentation (e.g., 8.33 or
16.67 or 25 or 33.33 ms) (see Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019; Tsikandilakis,
Bali, Madan, Derrfuss, Chapman & Groeger, 2021; Tsikandilakis et al., 2022d). The explicit
outlining of these tangible problems had a paradoxical effect (Bargh & Morsella, 2008): it
restored a quantum of confidence in the future of research into the unconscious. It signified a
passage from thesis-affiliated conflicts to an objective exploration of the methodological issues
that required address and resolution in this area.
For example, a very contentious issue in this area was what metrics should be used for
the assessment of perception during visual suppression (Swets, 2014). Relevant research, in its
vast majority, provided hit-rate outcomes – the percentage of correct answers – to assess
perception under conditions of visual suppression (Brooks et al., 2012; Meneguzzo, Tsakiris,
Schioth, Stein & Brooks, 2014). This was problematic. Hit rates can be affected by response
bias. For example, some participants might respond conservatively, that is, they withhold a
post-trial engagement task response for seeing an elicitor unless they are absolutely certain.
Others might respond liberally, that is, they might respond in a post-trial engagement task
seeing a masked elicitor even if they are quite unsure (Stanislaw & Todorov, 1999).
To address this issue, unbiased metrics for detection sensitivity such as signal detection
theory receiver operating characteristic (ROC) were suggested as an alternative (Zhang &
Mueller, 2005). The advantage of receiver operating characteristics was that they took into
account error for the assessment of participant responses. They provided a ratio between hits,
such as true positives, signifying that a participant responded in a post-trial task that a target
was presented when a target was presented, and miss responses, such as false alarms, signifying
that a participant responded that a target was presented when a target was not presented
(Hautus, Macmillan & Creelman, 2021). Receiver operating characteristics were not biased by
conservative or liberal response strategies and criteria and could provide a reliable perception
metric for whether the presented masked elicitors were consciously perceived or not (see
Yonelinas & Parks, 2007).
Another issue was the statistical analyses used for inferring whether participants were
unconscious (Dienes, 2014; 2015; 2016). The vast majority of topical research used
significance testing – in this case, a frequentist one-sample t-test – to infer unconscious
prοcessing (Brooks et al., 2012). This analysis allowed researchers to compare the participants’
responses to chance (e.g., 50% or d’ = 0 or A’ = .5 or A = .5; see Hautus, Macmillan &
Creelman, 2021). The researchers explored whether they were able to report non-significant
differences between the participants’ detection performance and chance, and if they did, they
claimed that the presented elicitors were processed unconsciously (Dienes, 2015).
As our group (Tsikandilakis & Chapman, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Chapman & Peirce,
2018; Tsikandilakis, Bali & Chapman, 2019; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019;
Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2020a; 2020b; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Haralabopoulos,
Derrfuss & Chapman, 2020; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Yu, Madan, Derrfuss, Chapman & Groeger,
2021; Tsikandilakis et al., 2019; 2021; 2022a) and other researchers (Howard, Maxwell &
Fleming, 2000; Rouder, Morey, Speckman & Pratte, 2007; Rouder, Speckman, Sun, Morey &
Iverson, 2009; Dienes, 2014; 2015; 2016; Dienes, Coulton & Heather, 2018; Vadillo, Malejka,
Lee, Dienes & Shanks, 2021) have repeatedly emphasized, significance testing can only
provide evidence that we can reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. Even if we fail to reject
the null hypothesis, in this instance, we do not have evidence that the participants’ performance
was proximate to or at-chance. We have evidence that suggest that we can reject that the
participant’s perception was not significantly different to chance. This is subsequently
mistreated as evidence for the participant’s perception being proximate to or at chance (see
Kruschke, 2011).
This issue can be resolved using Bayesian analysis. Bayesian analysis requires the
standard error of a sample, the mean difference of a sample, a comparison value, and lower and
upper bounds that define the range for proximity of the population value to the comparison
value, called credible intervals (see Dienes, 2016). With these we can provide a Bayes factor
(BF). The BF can predict the likelihood that the data were observed under the alternate
hypothesis or the null hypothesis. A BF < .33, for example, would signify that the participants’
responses provided direct evidence that the data can be predicted and observed under the null
hypothesis and that they were within a priori defined credible intervals for unconsciousness
(Rouder, Haaf & Vandekerckhove, 2018). In case of .33 ≤ BF ≤ 3, the data are considered
inconclusive, and at B > 3, the likelihood is that the data can be predicted and observed under
the alternate hypothesis, and the participants were conscious of the presented elicitors (see
Rouder, Morey, Speckman & Pratte, 2007; for the presented Bayesian metrics above see
These concepts have been frequently discoursed (see Shanks, Malejka & Vadillo, 2021;
Tsikandilakis, Bali, Yu, Madan, Chapman & Groeger, 2021) but infrequently applied (van der
Ploeg, Brosschot, Versluis & Verkuil, 2017; see particularly Tsikandilakis et al., 2022d; pp.
16-17). This shows the extend of empirical bias in relevant research. It is also challenging from
an educational perspective. Receiver operating characteristics were first introduced by Marcum
in 1947. They have been revised and refined multiple times (Peterson, Birdsall & Fox, 1954;
Pollack & Norman, 1964; Banks, 1970; Lord, 1985; Macmillan, 1993; Stanislaw & Todorov,
1999) until – arguably (see Verde, Macmillan & Rotello, 2006) – Zhang and Mueller (2005)
implemented the most unbiased to date non-parametric sensitivity index (A) including several
corrections to d, A’ and A’’ (see Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019; pp. 14-21).
Conversely, the Bayesian theorem dates back 259 years (Bayes & Hume, 1763). It was
first suggested as an alternative analysis to one-sample significance testing 76 years ago by
C.W. Churchman (1946). It has been suggested to be a more valid alternative to one-sample t-
tests by a plethora of authors in a plethora of publications thereafter (Lindley, 1957; Lann,
1959; Rozeboom, 1960; Edwards, Lindman & Savage, 1963; Bernardo, 1980; Berger & Sellke,
1987; Howard, Maxwell & Fleming, 2000; Rouder, Morey, Speckman & Pratte, 2007; Rouder,
Speckman, Sun, Morey & Iverson, 2009; Dienes, 2014; 2015; 2016).
ROC and Bayesian analyses are for the better part of the last thirty years included in
standard statistical software used for psychological research (SPSS, STATA, MEDCALC etc.).
open-access easy-to-populate toolboxes for implementing ROCs and Bayesian analyses. This
– to phrase our argument as provocatively as it should be phrased – has left a large number of
topical researchers unmoved and has created a niche of relevant research in which the
researchers are possibly unaware of or unwilling to take these methods under consideration.
With a mind that patience is a virtue, we have reiterated these themes and resolutions here. We
will continue to iterate them until common sense becomes common practice (Tsikandilakis,
Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2020a;
Tsikandilakis, Bali, Yu, Madan, Derrfuss, Chapman & Groeger, 2021)
These resolutions have offered us reliable metrics for perception and fitting statistical
models for assessing unconsciousness (see Chambers, 2019). They have also raised new
challenges. For example, using unbiased metrics and analyses for unconsciousness, attaining
unconsciousness became significantly harder (see Elgendi, Kumar, Barbic, Howard, Abbott &
Cichocki, 2018). In other (and again provocative words), it was not necessarily a difficult task
when using biased metrics for perception (i.e., hit rates), and misusing statistical inference
(significance testing one-sample t-tests) to suggest that stimuli were presented without
conscious awareness (see Dienes, 2015). On the other hand, when using unbiased receiver
operating characteristics (i.e., sensitivity index A; Zhang & Mueller, 2005) and statistical
analyses that require the conclusive provision of evidence for the likelihood that the data were
observed under the null (i.e., Bayesian analyses; Dienes, 2014), inferring unconsciousness
became considerably more difficult (Moore, 2008).
To address this hurdle, we previously applied (Tsikandilakis & Chapman, 2018;
Tsikandilakis, Chapman & Peirce, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2020a) and
synoptically discoursed (Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019; Tsikandilakis, Bali,
Yu, Madan, Derrfuss, Chapman & Groeger, 2021) a method for attaining unbiased individual
unconsciousness. This method addressed the difficulties for attaining unbiased evidence for
unconscious presentations. It was conceptually founded on empirical outcomes that suggested
that different participants (Pessoa, McKenna, Gutierrez & Ungerleider, 2002; Pessoa, 2005;
Japee, Crocker, Carver, Pessoa & Ungerleider, 2009; Albrecht, Klapötke & Mattler, 2010;
Albrecht & Mattler, 2012) and different elicitor types (Pessoa, McKenna, Gutierrez &
Ungerleider, 2002; Pessoa & Ungerleider, 2004; Balconi & Lucchiari, 2007; Etkin et al., 2008;
Hedger, Adams & Garner, 2015) required different durations of presentation for attaining
unaware presentations during masking (Elgendi, Kumar, Barbic, Howard, Abbott & Cichocki,
2018).
The justifications of these differences in perceptual ability have been attributed to
differences in attentional and cognitive resources of individual participants (Barrett, Tugade &
Engle, 2004; Bishop, 2008; Kaspar & König, 2012). They have also been attributed to the
evolutionary value (Öhman, 2009), low-spatial frequencies (De Gardelle & Kouider, 2010) and
high-level component characteristics (Guenter, Grimm, Wood, Malvar, & Pighin, 1998) of
different elicitor types that are discoursed at length in previous publications (see for example
Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss, & Chapman, 2019; Tsikandilakis et al., 2022d).
The overarching aim of the current work is not merely to review these – arguably
(Tsikandilakis et al., 2022d) – known and extensively discoursed subjects (see Pessoa,
McKenna, Gutierrez & Ungerleider, 2002; Pessoa, 2004; Japee, Crocker, Carver, Pessoa &
Ungerleider, 2009; Pessoa & Adolphs, 2010); it is to show how to overcome them. We present
here in full the rationale and a methodology for replication for attaining unbiased individual
unconsciousness. Individual unconsciousness employs unbiased ROC metrics and Bayesian
analyses, and can enable us to adjust the threshold of presentation of a masked elicitor
separately for each participant for each presented elicitor type to chance-level detection
performance, that would signify that a “participant responded like a blind person would” (see
Erdelyi, 2004; pp. 76-81; see also Tsikandilakis & Chapman, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Chapman
& Peirce, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss
& Chapman, 2020a).
The methodological framework of this method is based on dividing a study into two
stages. In stage one, a set of masked stimuli is presented. These stimuli are presented for
different durations, such as 8.33 and 16.67 and 25 ms. The participants are asked whether they
perceived a masked target after each trial. The duration of presentation that for each participant
and elicitor type provides evidence for the null when subjected to Bayesian analyses using
unbiased sensitivity index A is selected as the threshold of unconsciousness for that participant
and for that elicitor type (see for example Tsikandilakis, Chapman & Peirce, 2018;
Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2020a).
In a second stage, typically, a week after the first stage (see Garrido et al., 2020), the
same participants are presented with different stimuli belonging to the same elicitor types (e.g.,
happy, fearful and neutral faces). These stimuli are presented using masking for the durations
that were shown to provide substantial evidence for the null in stage one. Participants’ self-
reports, such as ratings for valence and intensity, and psychophysiological responses, such as
skin conductance responses (SCR), heart-rate responses (HR), facial-expression assessment
(FA), and further physiological and neuroscientific assessments are measured to explore
unconscious processing and emotional responsivity (see Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss &
Chapman, 2020a).
Individual unconsciousness has received an academic welcome (Tsikandilakis &
Chapman, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Chapman & Peirce, 2019; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss &
Chapman, 2020a) and has been previously synoptically discoursed (Tsikandilakis, Bali,
Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Yu, Madan, Derrfuss, Chapman & Groeger,
2021). It would not be an understatement to submit that its reception raised considerable
interest and debate concerning exactly how to replicate it, which participant inclusion criteria
should be used, what were the most successful coding methodological and statistical scripts we
employed in previous research, what should be the methodology for measuring and interpreting
the psychophysiological outcomes of this method, and, in general, a demand for an exact,
detailed and thorough discourse of the workings of our method (Madipakkam & Rothkirch,
2019; Maldonado et al., 2020). As requested, therefore, in this manuscript, we provide the
reader with a step-by-step rationale and replication guide, including open-source statistical and
methodological coding scripts, and empirical data illustrations, to enable a direct replication of
key parts or of the entire process.
Making Unconsciousness
Let us assume that in stage one we would like to present participants with backward
masked fearful, happy and neutral faces and adjust per participant and elicitor type the
individual threshold for unconsciousness. The first thing we need to correctly calculate is
power. For our intended design, liberal power calculations (P ( ) = .8; p ≤ .05; f = .25) require
1 - β
n = 28 and conservative power calculations (P ( ) ≥ .9; p ≤ .01; f = .1) require n = 302 (Faul,
1 - β
Erdfelder, Buchner & Lang, 2009). Obviously, we would, if it is possible, advise for the latter,
but a compromise between these extreme lower and higher computations (P ( ) = .9; p ≤ .01;
1 - β
f = .25) requiring n = 49 has proven sufficient in previous studies to provide us with meaningful
results (see Tsikandilakis & Chapman, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Chapman & Peirce, 2018;
Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019; 2020a).
We need to bear in mind two more things. Firstly, we would not object to the statistical
scholar who would consider the default ε = 1 sphericity value coded in standard power
calculation software (e.g., GPOWER; see Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner & Lang, 2009) an “ideal
world” value (see Berkovits, Hancock & Nevitt, 2000). The overall mean of ε in our previous
studies (k = 14) was .83 (SD = .04). Replacing the default coded value ε = 1 with ε = .83 in
GPOWER 3.1 gives us n = 58. This increase in the sample size could contribute to an increase
of the validity of our outcomes (Lane, 2016). Secondly, we should not forget the importance
of contour in validating power calculations (Baker et al., 2020). In our case, for our power
calculations, 40 to 60 trials per condition (i.e., elicitor type) must be presented to achieve a P
= .9. This is a very understated and underused statistical calculation in experimental
(1 – β)
psychology and can lead to Type-I and Type-II errors (see Cohen, MacWhinney, Flatt &
Provost, 1993; Brand, Bradley, Best & Stoica, 2010; Murphy, Myors & Wolach, 2014; Arnoldo
advisable to select from the required range of trial contour a number that can divide to an
integer (e.g., 40; 40/2 = 20). This can allow participants to attain unbiased perfect chance-level
performance (e.g., A = .5) if this is, indeed, their true perceptual sensitivity, and avoid
unfeasible-to-implement decimal repetitions for the contour of the presented stimuli
(Tsikandilakis, Chapman & Peirce, 2018) .
Our next implementations relate to sampling and particularly to participant selection
criteria. We have imposed and debated very strict criteria to improve the reliability and validity
of our studies (Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2020a). Our first step is to screen
participants for psychiatric conditions. The reader can choose for this purpose from a plethora
of available, validated questionnaires that have been widely used in previous research (see
Haynes, & Lench, 2003). They can also choose more contemporary questionnaires that include
less widely applied but potentially more up-to-date psychiatric assessment items (see Rosellini
& Brown, 2021). Our choice for a clinical assessment questionnaire is Sphere-12 (Hickie et al.,
2001). Our choice is made on the grounds that Sphere-12 has convergent validity with
assessments for both temporary mood and undiagnosed psychiatric conditions (Berryman,
McAuley & Moseley, 2012; for an open-source format of Sphere-12, see
The next questionnaire we commonly use is an assessment for Alexithymia and
Alexithymia traits. These can be described as a subclinical difficulty to express, experience and
1 We could also calculate Bayesian power for equivalence of significance to the null for the purposes of the current
stage. This is a complicated process both conceptually and as regards communicating comprehensively the
required code that would provide a meaningful result (Rescorla, 2015). It would require an address in an at least
partly mathematically populated publication (see Schönbrodt & Wagenmakers, 2018). However, we can compute,
for the purposes of the current stage, that our current design has sufficient Bayesian power for providing evidence
for the null given credible intervals for equivalence of significance testing for the null conservatively defined at
less than a small critical f (.1) given n = 49 (P (H ) = .9; BF < .33; f (.01 to .09)) and n = 58 (P (H ) ≥ .9; BF <
01 01
.33; f (.01 to .09)) (Kruschke, 2011). These can be converted to indicate contribution effects of .0001% to .0009%
of an interdependent to a dependent variable (see Kruschke & Liddell, 2018). Calculations, instructions and code
for replicating this outcome and calculating Bayesian power have been made available online and can be found at
2 In the interest of applied ethical standards in scientific practice, the participants should be informed of the
outcomes of the clinical assessments, and the researchers should have a document ready directing them to
university and local psychological support infrastructures and clinical-assessment facilities. We stand by that the
responsibilities of a research should go beyond career-advancing practices. The participants were invited to a
study on the premises of the correct or incorrect knowledge of not being aware that they are suffering from a
psychiatric disorder. In case we have a mind for exploring the exceptions of this pre-requirement towards a
publication, we would like to stress that this could constitute an invaluable contribution to this area if it was a
planned objective (Hedger, Gray, Garner & Adams, 2016), and we would also like to stress that his could be
unethical practice given our study description (see Sinclair, 2017).
recognize emotion (Taylor & Bagby, 2000). The inclusion of participants with Alexithymia, or
Alexithymia traits, exposes the results of particularly emotion-assessing studies to potential
biases. This is also a little recognized fact, and assessments for Alexithymia have not been
consistently applied as an exclusion criterion for the participants or the participants’ data in
topical research. This has resulted in lack of knowledge concerning whether the participants
were potential responders or non-responders of true positives (i.e., hits) for the perception of
masked elicitors (see van der Ploeg, Brosschot, Versluis & Verkuil, 2017). Our choice/solution
for this issue is participant assessment and data-exclusion of above-threshold values using the
OAQ-G2 (Thompson, 2007). Our choice is made on the grounds that OAQ-G2 provides
reliable assessments for the diagnosis of Alexithymia and separately for high scores for
Alexithymia traits, such as emotional awareness, social detachment and interpersonal
functionality (Donges, Kersting & Suslow, 2014; for an open-source format of OAQ-G2, see
Another assessment we commonly use is the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire
(ERQ; delValle, Andres, Urquijo, Zamora, Mehta & Gross, 2021). The ERQ is a brief 10-item
assessment involving ratings from one (strongly agree) to seven (strongly disagree). It is used
to assess cognitive emotional reappraisal, such as the intensity, control and ability to access
and process one’s emotions, and emotional suppression, such as the inclination and predilection
to communicate one’s emotions (Ochsner. & Gross, 2005). We use this questionnaire on the
grounds that it has been shown to report high convergent validity with the sensitivity of
perception and the psychophysiological outcomes of exposure to emotional images (Mauss,
Levenson, McCarter, Wilhelm & Gross, 2005). Extreme values in this questionnaire, therefore,
can be an indication that both perception and physiological responses could be influenced by
subclinical emotional traits (see Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2020a; for an open-
Finally, given the sensitivity of the current design to confounds, we implement an
additional and strict self-developed method (see Tsikandilakis et al., 2022a). We have termed
this method Bayesian sampling. We employ it when using the ERQ, and any other
questionnaire we have previously used that could provide evidence for non-clinical emotional
processing biases (Tsikandilakis & Chapman, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Chapman & Peirce, 2018;
Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2020a). Our method consists of, firstly, excluding
the data from participants that have scores in the ERQ – or any other relevant emotional
questionnaire (Van Humbeeck, Van Audenhove, De Hert, Pieters & Storms, 2002) – that are
1.5 units below or above the median interquartile range (IQR) for Q1 and Q3 respectively. This
method allows us to control for outliers without having to rely on the assumption of
parametricity (see particularly Leys, Ley, Klein, Bernard & Licata, 2013).
Subsequent to this intervention, we reverse-engineer Bayesian analyses for equivalence
of significance (see particularly Zednik & Jäkel, 2014; 2016). We know the mean, standard
deviation and standard error of normal values in the wider population for our assessment (ERQ
: M = 10.49; SD = 2.91; SE = .09; ERQ : M = 21.53; SD = 3.86;
emotional regulation emotional suppression
SE = .11; see for example Sala et al., 2012). We also know the mean for each of our participants.
We do not know and cannot reliably know in this instance, without falling prey to the
limitations of extrapolating Monte-Carlo simulations from a single value derived from
categorical responses (Garrido, Abad & Ponsoda, 2016), and re-assessment participant biases
(Gross et al., 2012), the measures of dispersion for each individual participant. We can,
nevertheless, test whether each participant provides Bayesian evidence for equivalence to the
null for canonical values for this – or any other applied – questionnaire assessment (see
Tsikandilakis et al., 2019; pp. 6 & 12; Tsikandilakis et al., 2021, pp. 11, 17 & 19; Tsikandilakis
et al., 2022a, pp. 9 & 28).
For example, let us assume that a particular participant has an ERQ score for emotional
regulation of 10.51. The mean for a canonical score including cross-cultural and mixed gender
values is 10.43. The mean difference between the participant’s score and the comparison value
is .08. The standard error of the overall assessed population is .09. If we are liberal with our
credible intervals, we can define the lower and higher bounds at – 5.87 and 5.87 (2*SD
overall
). If we want to be quite strict with our credible intervals, we can define them at – 2.91
population
and 2.91 or less (such -1 and 1 intervals). For this participant, therefore, the chances that their
emotional regulation score can be observed as proximate to a controlled general population
value is BF = .03 for liberal credible criteria and BF = .06 for strict criteria (BF = .17; CIs (-1
to 1)). This means that, even under strict inclusion control conditions, we were able to report
substantial evidence that the data of this participant were predicted and observed under the null
and can be included in the analyses (for open-source statistical code for this method, see
inclusivity is quite thorough and exacting but it allows us to control for outliers within our own
data – without relying on the assumption of parametricity – and in comparison between our
data and assessment values as reported in previous research (see Gullone & Taffe, 2012).
Our next steps relate to stimuli selection. The selected stimuli should ideally be
controlled for valence, intensity and emotional ambiguity. These variables should ideally
provide same-elicitor type Bayesian evidence for equivalence of significance (Tsikandilakis &
Chapman, 2018). In a previous publication (Tsikandilakis, Chapman & Peirce, 2018; pp. 78-
91 & Appendix 1A & 1B), we introduced a metric for this type of elicitor selection. We
conducted a pilot study, including 52 participants (26 female; P ( ) ≥ .9; p ≤ .01; f = .25), to
1 - β
select from a surplus of 2,000 faces (Gur et al., 2002) the most potent elicitors for fearful and
happy faces, and the neutral faces that did not confer emotional responsivity. The metric we
used is presented below:
𝑆𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝐶𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑛 (% 𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐)
𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 + 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔
= ((((10 – 𝐴𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑔𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔) + ) ∗ 50)
+ (((𝑆𝐶𝑅 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝐷𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑙 {𝑆𝐶𝑅 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝐷𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑙 𝑆𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑢𝑠 𝑇𝑦𝑝𝑒}) ∗ 25)
+ (( 𝐻𝑅 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝐷𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑙 {𝐻𝑅 𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝐷𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑙 𝑆𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑢𝑠 𝑇𝑦𝑝𝑒}) ∗ 25)))
In this occasion, this signified that in a separate experiment, involving all the
aforementioned sampling criteria, we inquired about the valence, intensity and emotional
ambiguity and assessed skin conductance and heart-rate responses for over 2,000 faces to
conclude to the selected sample of faces that we used in our main study. We would not object
to that this choice can be burdensome for most projects, but, more critically, that it can result
in including the most emotionally arousing but not necessarily the most representative and
ecologically valid emotional stimuli for each elicitor type (see Schyns & Oliva, 1997).
Another method we have used is predefining meaningful values for our included elicitor
types and conducting Bayesian analyses for finding out which of our stimuli meet sensible a-
priori requirements. For example, for our current design, including three types of faces (fearful,
happy and neutral), we can either derive a priori values from previous research (Kring & Sloan,
2007; Adolph & Alpers, 2010) or define them ourselves (see for example Maxwell, Lau &
Howard, 2015; Wiggins & Christopherson, 2019; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman,
2020a). In both cases, assessment and validation using digital facial-emotional recognition
technology, such as Noldus Face Reader (see Skiendziel, Rösch & Schultheiss, 2019), is a
potential merit for pre-selection but not necessarily a requirement for pre-selection (see
Tsikandilakis et al., 2019; 2021b; 2022a; 2022b).
For example, in studies like ours in which stimuli are presented for very brief durations,
we would be well advised to include assessments for valence, intensity and also emotional
ambiguity (Barrett, 2006). This is because in previous studies we have shown that valence and
intensity can differ within a same-elicitor-type category (Tsikandilakis, Chapman & Peirce,
2018; Tsikandilakis, Bali & Chapman, 2019; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman,
2020a). We have also shown that stimuli categorized under the umbrella term of a prototypical
emotional category can be better described as other emotions, such as faces categorized as
angry providing empirical evidence for re-categorization as hostile (Tsikandilakis, Bali,
Derrfuss & Chapman, 2020b), and stimuli categorized as sad involving characteristics relating
distinguishably to melancholy, bereavement, misery and despair (Tsikandilakis et al., 2022b;
see also Cowen & Keltner, 2020). These can lead to differences in perceptual sensitivity and
emotional responsivity (Tsikandilakis, Bali, Yu, Madan, Derrfuss, Chapman & Groeger, 2021).
For example, in an unpublished pilot conducted in 2020, we recruited a sample size of
52 participants (26 female; M = 23.01; SD = .94) (P ( ) ≥ .9; p ≤ .05; f = .25). We did
age age 1 - β
not want strictly prototypical stimuli because these can lead to extreme emotional responsivity
and lack ecological validity (Tsikandilakis et al., 2019; 2021; 2022a; 2022b; 2022c). We chose
that for ambiguity for all faces we would like to include a desired value of eight in a scale of
one (very ambiguous) to nine (not ambiguous at all) or, if our results yielded unexpectedly low
ratings, seven, but no less than that, to achieve within-elicitor-type emotional homogeneity.
For neutral faces, a value of five was considered meaningful to reliably confer null emotional
characteristics for intensity and valence. For happy faces, an intensity value of seven in a scale
from one (not intense at all) to nine (very intense), and a valence of seven in a scale from one
(very negative valence) to nine (very positive valence) was selected as a meaningful value.
Conversely, fearful faces were required to be at proximity of an intensity value of seven and a
valence value of three.
In this pilot, we did not have to reverse-engineer Bayesian analysis. Given ratings for
the same image from the sum of our population size (n = 52), we could calculate means and
measures of dispersion for each image. For example, one of our images showing a happy face
was rated with mean valence of 7.13 (SD = .67). We used a simple transformation of measures
𝑆𝐷 .67
of dispersions (𝑆𝐸 = ), to calculate the standard error, which yielded 𝑆𝐸 = = .09. We
√𝑛 7.21
applied strict (- 1 to 1) lower and higher bounds, and given a mean difference of .13, we
reported a BF = .32. This value qualified the particular image for inclusion. This was an arduous
task that was applied individually for every image and for each individual rating for every
image (i.e., valence, intensity, ambiguity). The resulting pool of images rewarded us in that
every elicitor was without exception within our predefined criteria (see Dienes, 2014; 2015;
2016).
Our next steps, related to stimuli processing and presentation. These topics are very
important. We have provided a dedicated paper pending for publication for these, therefore, we
will keep this section concise and refer the reader to our dedicated discourse (Tsikandilakis et
al., 2022d). The canon for processing faces in topical research is cropping a face to standard
dimensions (e.g., height: 6 cm, width: 4 cm), removing non-facial characteristics, and applying
grayscale conversions to control for luminosity and colour contrast (see Brooks et al., 2012).
All but the latter are common and sensible techniques (but see also Kim et al., 2010); the latter
is quite problematic (De Gardelle & Kouider, 2010). The problem with grayscale conversions
is that they maintain the colour contrast and luminosity of the original images and transcribe it
to diverse shades of grey (see Gray, Adams, Hedger, Newton & Garner, 2013; see also
Tsikandilakis et al., 2022d).
Visual stimuli can be broadly divided as having low and high-level component
characteristics. The low-level component characteristics include luminosity, brightness and
contrast while the high-level components involve the distribution of these characteristics that
contribute to the structure of an image (Shapley,1990; see also Wyart & Tallon-Baudry, 2009;
Spillmann & Werner, 2012; Izmailov, Chernorizov & Polyansky, 2022). We can manipulate
the former and average their lumens values to exactly similar values which will result in a
reduction of perceptual sensitivity bias due to low-level facial features (Willenbockel, Sadr,
Fiset, Horne, Gosselin & Tanaka, 2010). If we apply this method both to our masked and mask
stimuli we can have “equivalence of contrast” of the mean lumens of the elicitors in our design

MATLAB processing. The Mean lumens of both the pattern masks and the presented target is averaged to a mid-lumens value of 140.
This can reduce variations in masked stimuli perceptibility due to differences in lumens values and masked-to-mask stimuli contrast.
We cannot manipulate the distribution of luminosity of images. We cannot manipulate
high-level component characteristics in images, such as the distributions of lumen values,
without deconstructing the basic facial characteristics of an expression that confer emotion (see
Gray, Adams, Hedger, Newton & Garner, 2013; for an infamous attempt to manipulate high-
level component characteristics in facial expressions of emotion, see
processing and presenting stimuli are limited to averaging mean lumens values within masked
Kouider, 2010). This is not an evitable limitation and the already applied corrections have been
sufficient to eliminate perceptual biases in past studies (Tsikandilakis et al., 2022d; pp. 19-33;
As we stated before, to achieve the necessary power contour for our design, each elicitor
should be presented at least forty times, or in forty trials (Baker et al., 2020). Therefore, during
stage one, fearful, happy and neutral faces will have to be presented forty times for each
duration that in previous research has provided evidence for qualifying as a potential duration
for being an individual threshold for unconsciousness (e.g., 8.33 or 16.67 or 25 ms;
Tsikandilakis & Chapman, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Chapman & Peirce, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Bali,
Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Yu, Madan, Derrfuss, Chapman & Groeger,
2021). This amounts to 120 faces per elicitor type or 360 faces overall. To provide unbiased
sensitivity index A outcomes we can benefit from an equal signal to noise ratio, therefore, we
must also include 360 Gaussian blurs (120 blurs for 8.33 and 16.67 and 25 ms; see
Tsikandilakis et al., 2022d; pp. 11-13). These will be used as the metric for our false alarms
such as responding that a face was presented when a face was not presented during a binary
engagement task (i.e., “Did you see a face during the presentation? (Y/N)”) post-trial signal-
detection; Zhang & Mueller, 2005).
This implementation will allow us to compute the overall A for stage one. We are
interested in which duration (8.33 or 16.67 or 25 ms) is per participant and elicitor type closest
to chance. One way to achieve an unbiased per participant and elicitor type sensitivity A with
equal signal (faces) to noise (blurs) ratio is pre-experimentally assigning a random set of forty
Gaussian blurs that have the same duration as a presented elicitor type (8.33 or 16.67 or 25 ms)
to that elicitor type for each duration (i.e., Fear_Blurs-Set_8.33, Happy_Blurs-Set_8.33,
Neutral_Blurs-Set_8.33; Fear_Blurs-Set_16.67, Happy_Blurs-Set_16.67, Neutral_Blurs-
Set_16.67; Fear_Blurs-Set_25, Happy_Blurs-Set_25, Neutral_Blurs-Set_25).
We can also do this task post-experimentally, as long as we do not match the best fit
false alarm trials with an elicitor type duration that will provide optimized results for A, or fall
prey to simple and innocuous human error, such as repeating one or more Gaussian blurs as
part of the corresponding set of two or more elicitor types. We could also simply divide the
overall number of trials (k = 120) of Gaussian blurs for each duration (8.33 or 16.67 or 25 ms)
by three and include the resulting scores for false alarms to the corresponding duration of each
of our elicitor types. Given the basic framework of the central limit theorem this would, in fact,
work in favour of achieving proximity to A = .5. As such, it will represent a dissemblance and
not a realistic equivalence of signal to noise ratio (see Zhang & Mueller, 2005; pp. 208-211).
The first proposed method involving randomised pre-experimental denominations of the noise
to signal ratio is the one we use in our work (see Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman,
2020a).
For example, let us present the above as an empirical illustration. In our aforementioned
2020 pilot, one example – and exemplary for illustration purposes – participant was presented
with forty fearful, happy and neutral faces for 8.33 and 16.67 and 25 ms with backward
blurs for 8.33 and 16.67 and 25 ms using a pre-experimental assignment of forty blurs to each
duration by elicitor type combination, as described in the first part of the previous paragraph.

performance at A =.5. Bars represent ±2 standard errors of the mean. Values with bold characters for fearful, happy
and neutral faces indicate the closest to chance available sensitivity index A value from the range of included
durations of presentation (8.33 and 16.67 and 25 ms). Figures 2B-D., including fearful, happy and neutral faces,
involve wider range y axis values compared to 2A for illustration purposes.
For the specific participant, overall performance was closest to chance at 8.33 ms. With
a mean difference to absolute chance (A = .5) at .009, a standard error of .01 and lower and
upper bounds set at - .5 (A = .45) and .5 (A = .55), we reported a BF = .04 (for open-source
participant was overall proximate to chance and their performance could provide further
evidence for per elicitor type unconsciousness. For fearful faces their mean difference to
chance was .001 at 8.33 ms, for happy faces it was .002 at 16.67 ms and for neutral faces it was
.001 for 25 ms. Using the exact same parameters for analyses as above, fearful faces should be
presented for 8.33 ms (BF = .03), happy faces presented for 16.67 ms (BF = .03) and neutral
faces presented for 25 ms (BF = .03). We showed very substantial evidence for the null for all
three elicitor types, and we could proceed to the next stage with these durations to test whether
individual unconsciousness can lead to self-report and physiological responses.
Testing Unconsciousness
For stage two, our calculations suggest that we should present this particular participant
with forty 8.33 ms fearful faces, forty 16.67 ms happy faces and forty 25 ms neutral faces. This
also means that we will have to present forty 8.33 ms Gaussian blurs, forty 16.67 ms Gaussian

for 25 ms. 120 Gaussian blurs were also presented matched to each elicitor type for its duration of presentation. The stimuli were
masked with back-and-white patterns – and not neutral faces (Kim et al., 2010) – to avoid masked-to-mask stimuli emotional
incongruency (masked fearful and happy faces) and congruency (masked neutral faces) perceptual biases (see Tsikandilakis, Madan
& Milbank; pp. 16-19).
Our next subject topic is assessment. We would like to assess the physiology of the
participants and also their self-report ratings in response to our individually adjusted stimuli.
For physiological assessments, we have a certain set of combined methods that we have used
in past studies (see Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2020a). We have used skin
conductance (SCR), heart rate (HR) and facial-emotional expression recognition (FE) for our
physiological assessments. Our assessments involve SCR measured from the left hand
(index/first and middle/second fingers) of each participant using disposable Ag/AgCl gelled
electrodes received by a BIOPAC System, EDA100C in units of micro-Siemens (μS) and
recorded in AcqKnowledge. The presence of a phasic skin conductance response is defined as
an unambiguous increase (.01 μS) with respect to each pre-target SCR score occurring one to
three seconds post-elicitor offset. The presence of a heart-rate response is defined as an event-
related heart-rate peak in beats per minute with respect to each pre-target heart-rate score
occurring one to five seconds post-elicitor offset.
For facial expressions analyses, we use Noldus Face-Reader versions 7.1 to 9.1 (see
Sabatos-DeVito et al., 2019). We use an HD (4K) camera mounted at the bottom of the
presenting screen and centred on the participant’s face. The analysis is run using the maximum
video capture frames per second allowed by the face-reader equipment (30 fps). It includes a
custom template, and each participant is evaluated in respect to an expressed emotion after
controlling for facial-emotional characteristics that are present in their neutral expressions
using the participant calibration module. Expression of an emotion is defined as recognition of
an emotional expression up to five seconds post-elicitor offset (Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss &
Chapman, 2020a; 2020b; see also Skiendziel, Rösch & Schultheiss, 2019) .
For these assessments to provide us with meaningful results we need to develop a
matrix of post-trial and post-physiological assessment window functions. This should assess
hits, misses and it will be wise to include uncertainty as an indication of non-categorical
conscious perception and unawareness of the presented elicitors (see Morin, 2006). We could
also benefit from confidence ratings for these responses, particularly in the interest of linear
trend analyses (see particularly Tsikandilakis, Chapman & Peirce, 2018; pp. 79-83) and ratings
for valence and intensity for every post-trial set of engagement tasks (Tsikandilakis &
Chapman, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Chapman & Peirce, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss &
These are the psychophysiological assessments that we have used in previous publications. If the reader would
like to apply additional or different psychophysiological assessments, relevant procedures can be found in
Cacioppo, Tassinary and Berntson (2007; pp. 19-68 (fMRI & fNIRS); 85-91 (EEG); 120-131 (TMS); 211-218
(Gastrointestinal Responses); 231-235 (Respiratory Responses); see also Tsikandilakis, Bali, Haralabopoulos,
Derrfuss & Chapman, (2020)). In the aforementioned volume the reader will also be able to find additional
processes and parameters for measuring SCR (pp. 159-163), HR (pp. 182-197) and facial responses (pp. 267-291).

psychophysiological responses. This setup allows us to infer specific values for each response type such as hits, seeing a face that was presented,
misses, not seeing a face that was presented, and uncertainty responses, not being able to conclusively answer whether the participant saw or
not a face that was presented. Significant effects for physiological changes and self-report ratings in response to emotional faces for the latter
two conditions could stand as evidence that partial awareness and/or unconscious effects were reported using unbiased adjustments for
individual unco nsciousness. We use the word “very” as opposed to extremely in Likert scales because our pilot data have repeatedly shown
that the latter deters the participants from scores ≥ 7, therefore, biasing the design towards lesser ratings. We use the word “moderate” as
opposed to “neutral” in Likert scales relating to valence and intensity to maintain homogeneity between different engagement tasks (see
Tsikandilakis Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019; 2020a; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Yu, Madan, Derrfuss, Chapman & Groeger, 2021; Tsikandilakis,
Madan & Milbank, 2022).
We are ready now to proceed to the method for our analyses and – perhaps, most
interestingly – our outcomes . The usual approach in relevant research is to run a repeated-
measures ANOVA with independent variable Elicitor Type (fear, happy & neutral) and
dependent variable – for the purposes of this illustration – SCR (see Critchley, 2002; Mertens
& Engelhard, 2020). In case of significant results for the omnibus ANOVA, and significant
differences between Bonferroni-corrected elicitor type comparisons, such as higher
physiological arousal in response to fearful faces compared to happy and neutral faces, our
outcomes could be interpreted as evidence for unconscious emotional responsivity. They
should not (Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019; 2020a).
To make such inferences, we need to know where the responses are coming from. We
need to know what the responses of the participants were to faces they reported seeing when
these faces were presented (hits). We need to know what the responses of the participants were
to faces they reported they were unsure whether they saw or not when these faces were
presented (uncertainty). We need to know what the responses of the participants were to faces
they reported that they did not see when they were presented (misses).
To illustrate the importance of the division mentioned above, in our aforementioned
2020 pilot, we encountered a finding that we did not expect and was not in accordance with the
vast majority of our research outcomes when we previously applied individual
unconsciousness (see Tsikandilakis & Chapman, 2018; pp. 443-449; Tsikandilakis, Chapman
& Peirce, 2018; pp. 87-91; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019; pp. 21-25; 2020a;
pp. 501-507; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Yu, Madan, Derrfuss, Chapman & Groeger, 2021; pp. 13-18;
Tsikandilakis et al., 2022d; pp. 23-29). A repeated measures ANOVA with independent
variable Elicitor Type (fear, happy & neutral) and dependent variable skin conductance

because the latter often involve very discrete and small values and differences.
responses showed a significant effect of Elicitor Type (F (1.642, 83.747) = 371.249; p < .001;
η = .879; Greenhouse-Geisser corrected). Further Bonferroni-corrected comparisons showed
that fearful faces elicited higher SCR (M = .041; SD = .005) compared to happy (M = .028; SD
= .004; p < .001; d = 2.87) and neutral faces (M = .017; SD = .003; p < .001; d = 5.82). Happy
faces were also higher for SCR compared to neutral faces (p < .001; d = 3.11). We have
significant results for unconscious emotional responsivity as reported by higher SCR for fearful
faces compared to happy and neutral faces. In fact, we could argue that happy faces also
provided evidence for unbiased unconscious emotional responsivity if their comparison to
neutral faces can suffice to justify this claim (Winkielman & Berridge, 2004).
It is accurate to say that hits, reporting seeing a masked face when a masked face was
presented, can be referred to as conscious perception. On the other hand, miss responses, such
as reporting not seeing a masked face when a masked face was presented, can be referred to as
a presentation in which participants were not conscious of the masked target. The responses
for uncertainty could correspond between levels one, “almost no experience at all, any
responses would reflect mere guesses” and two, “a brief glimpse, a feeling that something has
been shown that cannot be characterized by any content and that cannot be explained further”,
in the PAS scale (Sandberg & Overgaard, 2015; pp. 182-185; see also Overgaard & Sandberg,
2021). It would be fair to call this condition of perception partial between consciousness and
unconsciousness, or simply perceptual uncertainty.
In our pilot, a repeated-measures ANOVA for consciously perceived stimuli (hits), with
the same independent and dependent variables described above, gives us significant results (F
(1.449, 73.877) = 421.708; p < .001; η = .892; Greenhouse-Geisser corrected). Further
Bonferroni-corrected comparisons reveal higher SCR for hits for fearful faces (M = .069; SD
= .011) compared to hits for happy (M = .041; SD = .011; p < .001; d = 2.545) and hits for
neutral faces (M = .017; SD = .004; p < .001; d = 6.282). Hits for happy faces were higher for
SCR than hits neutral faces (p < .001 d = 2.899). The same analysis for unconsciousness (miss
responses) presents us with very different outcomes. No significant differences and Bayesian
evidence for equivalence of significance for the null were reported between Elicitor Types (F
(2, 102) = 1.767; p = .176; η = .033; SE = .001; BF = .31). We can provide further Bonferroni-
corrected comparisons, and these also confirm that SCR were not significantly different and
provided evidence for the null for miss responses for fearful face (M = .017; SD = .005)
compared to miss responses for happy (M = .017; SD = .005; p = 534; d = .007; SE = .001; BF
= .18) and miss responses to neutral faces (M = .017; SD = .004; p = .229; d = .025; SE = .001;
BF = .27), and miss responses for happy faces compared to miss responses for neutral faces (p
= .999; d = .002; SE = .001; BF = .03).
For perceptual uncertainty, significant differences were reported between elicitor types
(F (2, 102) = 84.224; p < .001; η = .623). Responses for uncertainty when fearful faces were
presented (M = .037; SD = .009) were higher for SCR compared to responses for uncertainty
when happy (M = .027; SD = .008; p < .001; d = 1.174) and neutral faces (M = .018; SD =
.005; p < .001; d = 2.609) were presented. Responses for uncertainty when happy faces were
presented were higher for SCR than responses for uncertainty when neutral faces (p < .001; d
= 1.236). Perceptual uncertainty provided evidence that participants experienced higher
electrodermal responses to fearful faces compared to any other facial elicitor, and for happy
faces compared to neutral faces.
These findings illustrate our method and are important (see Brooks et al., 2012).
Conscious perception (hits) showed significant physiological responsivity, unconsciousness
(miss responses) showed evidence for the null, and perceptual uncertainty provided us with
significant findings for differences in skin conductance responses between fearful, happy and
neutral faces. Our method was illustrated, applied in a reader-friendly thorough and
comprehensive way, and – in this instance – it resulted in unexpected findings (see Morin,

Overall Summary
We presented a step-by-step replication guide for implementing individual
unconsciousness. We presented the statistical, mathematical and methodological processes for
calculating per participant and elicitor type the threshold for chance-level perception. We
presented the methodology for assessing self-report ratings and physiological responses to
individually adjusted backward masked targets. We presented an empirical illustration for
replication including unexpected results for higher arousal for uncertainty between fearful, and
happy and neutral faces.
General Discussion
Psychological research has been an area of polemic empirical discontent for whether
unconscious processing is or whether it is not a real phenomenon. This conflict runs deep and
old but so do multiple attempts to improve the methodological canon for assessing whether
unconscious processing is real. For example, the implementation of receiver operating
characteristics, instead of hit rates, in this area has enabled us to measure perceptual sensitivity
without – or at least with less (Stanislaw & Todorov, 1999) – bias and exposure to conservative
or liberal participant response strategies and criteria (see Hautus, Macmillan & Creelman,
2021). The implementation of Bayesian analyses has provided us with the means to show direct
evidence for the null – that participants were unconscious of a presented target – and has
contributed to the assessment of whether participants were unconscious during the presentation
of masked elicitors (Dienes, 2014; 2015; 2016). We have added to these a methodological
process. This method includes adjustments in the duration of masked presentations. These
adjustments are made separately for each participant and for each elicitor type.
This method consists of a first stage during which the durations of presentation that
provide evidence for the null hypothesis – that participants were proximate or at-chance level
for perceiving a masked target – are selected. It consists of a second stage during which
participants are presented with masked targets for these pre-defined durations. Their responses,
such as responses for seeing a presented face (hits), responses for not seeing a presented faces
(miss responses), and responses for being uncertain of having seen a presented face (responses
for uncertainty), are assessed. Their assessments can include self-report ratings and/or
physiological measurements, such as SCR, HR and facial-emotional analyses (see
Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019). The results are interpreted overall and
separately for each response (i.e., hits and miss responses, and responses for uncertainty; see
Tsikandilakis et al., 2020a).
This method is presented here in sufficient detail, including open-source material, open-
source methodological, mathematical and statistical code, and empirical illustrations, so that it
can be directly replicated (Tsikandilakis & Chapman, 2018; Tsikandilakis, Chapman & Peirce,
2018; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2019; 2020a; Tsikandilakis, Bali, Yu, Madan,
Derrfuss, Chapman & Groeger, 2021; Tsikandilakis et al., 2022d). The method is laborious, it
involves strict participant selection and assessment criteria, and it is overall arduous to
implement. It is also effective to the extent that the aim of an experiment involves the
attainment and assessment of unbiased unconsciousness (see example van der Ploeg,
Brosschot, Versluis & Verkuil, 2017; Vadillo, Linssen, Orgaz, Parsons & Shanks, 2020;
Vadillo, Malejka, Lee, Dienes & Shanks, 2021; Heck et al., 2022).
We have presented a difficult but feasible method. This method can provide us with
evidence for response effects under conditions of conscious, unconscious – and potentially –
partial awareness, such as responses for uncertainty in a post-trial signal detection task.
Whether uncertainty signifies unconscious processing will be extensively debated and we do
not make any claims concerning its interpretation at this stage given the ongoing debate on the
subject. We submitted the blueprints for unbiased individual unconsciousness and we have
made its outcomes available for discourse (Morin, 2006; Ramsøy, Friis-Olivarius, Jacobsen,
Jensen & Skov, 2012; Newell & Shanks, 2014; Fisk, & Haase, 2020; Siegel, 2022).
Developing the Future of Individual Unconsciousness
An important – albeit implicit – new challenge we have raised is to extend the outcomes
of the current method beyond the five-second post-trial physiological assessment and
participant engagement-task window during visual suppression (see Bargh & Morsella, 2008).
This is important to understand the effects of consciousness and unconsciousness deeper and
better. To do so, we will have to expand this method even more than we have done, seven
years, twenty-seven pilots and seventeen publications, since its conception. We have to
consider applying unbiased individual unconsciousness to the litmus of ecological validity and
contemporary psychological discontent relating to unconscious processing: unconscious (or
subliminal) priming.
This subject might seem extraneous but, having delivered the blueprints for the current
method, it is only natural to contemplate that in the last 57 years unconscious priming has
transformed from a notorious publicity hoax to a methodologically debated empirical reality.
Unconscious priming begun empirically with evidence for being a conditional effect, that can
take place unconsciously, only when the unconscious prime can satisfy an already existing
desire. Recently, it has landed at a point that relevant research has provided evidence that
unconscious primes can unconditionally influence – even against our personal ideologies and
beliefs – our interpersonal, cultural, racial, political, religious and emotional beliefs (see Bar &
Biederman, 1998; Karremans, Stroebe & Claus, 2006; Van Den Bussche, Van den Noortgate
& Reynvoet, 2009; Elgendi, Kumar, Barbic, Howard, Abbott & Cichocki, 2018; Albarrak,
Metatla & Roudaut, 2021; Tsikandilakis et al., 2022a).
These recent empirical evidence are subject to the limitations that we discoursed in the
introduction of the current manuscript. They have not been tested using individual thresholds
(see Meyen et al., 2022). The future of individual unconsciousness can be to explore these most
interesting and most provocative claims. It can be to explore what is the outcome of unbiased
individual unconscious presentations for our subsequent perceptions, and cognitive and
emotional responses. The next step of this method, now that its rationale and replicating tools
have been made available, can be its application within a context of ecological validity, and
the exploration of possibly the most enduring myth – or possibly the most unsettling reality –
of research relating to the unconscious: Can we really be primed to alter our emotions,
cognition and behaviours when presented with individually adjusted unconscious cues
(Tsikandilakis, Mével, Madan, Derrfuss & Milbank, 2022; in preparation)?
Conclusions
In this manuscript, we presented the methodological, mathematical, statistical and
outcome assessment framework for unbiased individual unconsciousness. We offered open-
source material, code and the required resources to replicate our method. We showed in several
empirical illustrations that this method is laborious in its implementation but that it is efficient
in achieving unbiased per participant and elicitor-type chance-level perceptual sensitivity. We
provided empirical illustrations. We showed challenging results for higher emotional
responsivity for fearful compared to happy and neutral faces only for responses for consciously
perceiving (hits) and responses for partial awareness (uncertainty) of masked elicitors. We
emphasized that perceptual uncertainty is a condition that merits discourse. We emphasized
that the developing future research applications of individual unconsciousness can be its
implementation for undertaking research in unconscious priming.
