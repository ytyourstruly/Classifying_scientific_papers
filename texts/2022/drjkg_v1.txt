22 Abstract
23 Even though the nature of confidence computations has been the topic of intense
24 interest, little attention has been paid to what confidence response times (cRT)
25 reveal about the underlying confidence computations. Several previous studies
26 found cRTs to be negatively correlated with confidence in the group as a whole and
27 consequently hypothesized the existence of an intrinsic relationship of cRT with
28 confidence for all subjects. This hypothesis was further used to support post-
29 decisional models of confidence that predict that cRT and confidence should always
30 be negatively correlated. Here we test the alternative hypothesis that cRT is driven
31 by the frequency of confidence responses such that the most frequent confidence
32 ratings are inherently made faster regardless of whether they are high or low. We
33 examined cRTs in three large datasets from the Confidence Database and found that
34 the lowest cRTs occurred for the most frequent confidence rating. In other words,
35 subjects who gave high confidence ratings most frequently had negative confidence-
36 cRT relationships, whereas subjects who gave low confidence ratings most
37 frequently had positive confidence-cRT relationships. In addition, we found a strong
38 across-subject correlation between RT and cRT, suggesting that response speed for
39 both the decision and the confidence rating is influenced by a common factor. Our
40 results show that cRT is not intrinsically linked to confidence, and strongly
41 challenge several post-decisional models of confidence.
42 Introduction
43 Humans have the metacognitive ability to estimate the accuracy of their decisions
44 (Metcalfe & Shimamura, 1994), which can guide their learning and subsequent
45 actions. (Desender et al., 2018; Fleming et al., 2012; Nelson, 1990; Shimamura, 2000;
46 Yeung & Summerfield, 2012). However, how one computes a confidence estimate
47 for a particular decision remains poorly understood despite the fact that confidence
48 computations have been a topic of intense interest in metacognition research
49 (Rahnev et al., 2022).
51 One potentially promising but little-explored avenue toward understanding
52 confidence computations is the examination of confidence response times (cRT).
53 Previous research found cRT to be associated with confidence and decision accuracy
54 (Baranski & Petrusic, 1998; Herregods et al., 2023; Moran et al., 2015; Pleskac &
55 Busemeyer, 2010). Specifically, these studies have claimed that confidence ratings
56 are computed faster whenever people are more confident or more accurate. These
57 relationships were further interpreted as evidence that confidence is based on a
58 post-decision evidence accumulation process (Herregods et al., 2023; Moran et al.,
59 2015; Pleskac & Busemeyer, 2010; Yu et al., 2015). Post-decision evidence
60 accumulation models assume that confidence is necessarily based on additional
61 evidence accumulated after the decision is made. For example, in the two-stage
62 dynamic signal detection (2DSD) optional stopping model (Pleskac & Busemeyer,
63 2010), different confidence levels have different confidence boundaries. The 2DSD
64 optional stopping model assumes that every time the evidence crosses a confidence
65 boundary, there is a certain probability that the accumulation process will be
66 terminated and a corresponding confidence response will be made. Another two
67 models (Herregods et al., 2023; Moran et al., 2015) assume the existence of
68 collapsing confidence boundaries that ensure that higher confidence responses are
69 given faster than lower confidence responses. Thus, substantial theoretical claims
70 have been made based on the relationship of cRT with confidence and accuracy.
72 The crucial hypothesis underlying post-decisional evidence accumulation models is
74 However, a previously unexamined alternative hypothesis is that cRT is driven by
75 the frequency of confidence responses such that the most frequent confidence
76 ratings are inherently made faster regardless of whether they are high or low
78 showing that more frequent motor actions are executed faster (Katzner & Miller,
79 2012; Mattes et al., 2002; Miller, 1998; Näätänen, 1971). Hypothesis 2 thus predicts
80 that for subjects who are biased towards low confidence, cRT will be lower for their
81 low versus high confidence ratings, but that the opposite relationship would be seen
82 for subjects biased towards high confidence. In other words, according to
83 Hypothesis 2, there is no intrinsic cRT-confidence relationship and instead any
84 observed relationship is due to subjects responding faster for their most frequent
85 confidence ratings.
89 between cRT and confidence. (A) Hypothesis 1 predicts that high confidence
90 responses are inherently made faster regardless of which confidence response is the
91 most frequent. Therefore, the same decrease in cRT should be observed for all
92 subjects. (B) Hypothesis 2 predicts that the most frequent confidence responses are
93 inherently made faster regardless of whether they are high or low. Therefore, the
94 relationship between cRT and confidence ratings would be different across subjects
95 based on each subject’s confidence bias.
97 Here we adjudicated between the two hypotheses about the cRT-confidence
98 relationship. To do so, we analyzed three large datasets from the Confidence
99 Database (Rahnev et al., 2020) and examined whether the pattern of results
100 matched the predictions of Hypothesis 1 or Hypothesis 2. The results followed
101 closely the predictions of Hypothesis 2, thus strongly challenging the assumed
102 intrinsic relationship between cRT and confidence (Hypothesis 1). These results
103 cast doubt on models that feature post-decision evidence accumulation processes
104 that necessarily result in a negative cRT-confidence relationship.
105 Methods
106 Dataset selection
107 To adjudicate between the two hypotheses above, we sought to examine the
108 relationship of cRT with confidence and accuracy in datasets with large sample sizes.
109 Specifically, we searched for datasets that (1) included confidence ratings with up to
110 4-point scales, (2) recorded cRTs, and (3) had at least 75 subjects who each
111 completed at least 200 trials per task. Note that we selected datasets with discrete
112 confidence scales with less than or equal to four confidence levels because we
113 analyzed separately groups of subjects based on their most frequent confidence
114 response and having more detailed confidence scales leads to too many subgroups
115 that diminish in sample size. We searched the 171 datasets included in the
116 Confidence Database (Rahnev et al., 2020) as of December 1, 2022, and found three
117 datasets that met the above conditions: “Bang_2019_Exp2”, “Haddara_2022_Expt1”,
118 and “Haddara_2022_Expt2”. For simplicity, here we call these datasets “Bang”,
119 “Haddara1”, and “Haddara2”, respectively. In addition, to further examine the
120 robustness of our results, we relaxed criterion 3 so that datasets with at least 30
121 (instead of 75) subjects who each completed 150 (instead of 200) trials per task
122 would be selected. These more liberal selection criterions resulted in the selection
123 of three additional datasets (“Maniscalco_2017_expt1”, “Maniscalco_2017_expt2”,
124 and “Yeon_unpub_Exp2”; Supplementary Methods). Analyses of these datasets led to
125 the same conclusions (Figures S1–S3).
127 Experimental designs
128 Complete details about the experiments can be found in the original articles (Bang
129 et al., 2019; Haddara & Rahnev, 2022). All datasets featured 2-choice perceptual
130 decisions with 4-point confidence ratings given with separate button presses. The
131 decisions and confidence ratings were untimed and were given with a computer
132 keyboard. Decisions were given with keys “1” and “2”. Confidence ratings were
133 given with keys “1”, “2” “3”, and “4”, with “1” indicating lowest confidence and “4”
134 indicating highest confidence. Below, we provide a bit more detail regarding each of
135 the three datasets.
137 In the Bang dataset (Bang et al., 2019), subjects (N = 201) indicated whether a Gabor
139 dataset consists of two tasks. For the coarse discrimination task, the Gabor patches
140 were embedded in noise and tilted 45 degrees away from the vertical. For the fine
141 discrimination task, the Gabor patches were tilted about 1 degree away from
142 vertical. The contrast in the coarse discrimination task and the tilt in the fine
143 discrimination task varied between subjects in order to match the average
144 performance across the two tasks. Each subject completed 100 trials for each of the
145 two tasks. Here we combined the data from both tasks.
149 Subjects indicated whether a Gabor patch was tilted clockwise or counterclockwise
150 from vertical. The dataset consists of coarse discrimination and fine discrimination
151 tasks with the contrasts and tilt angles of the Gabor patches varying between the
152 two tasks. The Gabor patch shown here is only for an illustration purpose and does
153 not faithfully represent stimuli in either of the two tasks. (B) The experimental task
154 in the Haddara1 and the Haddara2 datasets. In Haddara1, subjects saw a 7×7 grid
155 that consisted of the letters X and O (Task 1) or the colors red or blue (Task 2) and
156 indicated which letter or color occurred more frequently. (The illustration of Task 2
157 is not shown here.) Approximately half of the subjects received trial-by-trial
158 feedback in Task 1, while no feedback was given in Task 2. The task design in
159 Haddara2 is identical to Task 1 in Haddara1.
161 In the Haddara1 dataset (Haddara & Rahnev, 2022), subjects (N = 443) saw a 7×7
163 blue (Task 2). Subjects indicated which letter or color occurred more frequently. In
164 Task 1, approximately half of the subjects received trial-by-trial feedback about
165 whether the judgment was correct while the other half received no such feedback.
166 No feedback was given in Task 2. The proportion of the dominant stimulus was
167 31/49 for Task 1 and 27/49 for Task 2. Each subject completed 330 trials for Task 1
168 and 150 trials for Task 2. Here we again combined the data from both tasks and
169 analyzed together subjects who did or did not receive trial-by-trial feedback.
171 For the Haddara2 dataset (Haddara & Rahnev, 2022), the task design was identical
173 seven sessions over seven different days. Each subject completed 500 trials per day
174 and 3,500 in total. Approximately half of the subjects received trial-by-trial feedback
175 about whether the judgment was correct, while the other half received no such
176 feedback. We again analyzed together subjects who did or did not receive trial-by-
177 trial feedback. Note that even though Haddara1 and Haddara2 used the same task,
178 these datasets featured different distributions of confidence biases. Because
179 Haddara2 includes seven days, it is possible that these differences are due to
180 practice effects. To check for this possibility, we separately analyzed the data from
183 Analyses
184 For each subject in each of the three datasets, we excluded trials with RTs outside
185 mean ± 3 × SDs or cRTs outside mean ± 3 × SDs before conducting any data
186 analyses. We coded confidence ratings as scalar variables with values 1-4 when we
187 used them for analyses.
189 We divided subjects into four different groups according to their most frequent
190 confidence ratings and examined whether the cRT-confidence relationship varied
191 between groups. To measure the cRT-confidence relationship, we performed linear
192 regressions on cRT as a function of confidence for each subject and used the slopes
193 of the regressions (β ) as an indicator of the cRT-confidence relationship
cRT~Confidence
194 for each individual. We performed linear regressions on β as a function of
cRT~Confidence
195 groups to test the effects of groups on the cRT-confidence relationship.
197 We then tested the cRT-confidence relationship at the population level across
198 different datasets to examine whether the relationship is universal. To determine
199 the effect of confidence on cRT at the population level, we performed linear mixed-
200 effects model analyses on cRT as a function of confidence with random intercepts
201 and random slopes on confidence between subjects and examined the fixed effects
202 of confidence on cRT. Besides, we also tested the cRT-confidence relationship at the
cRT~Confidence
204 trials for each subject and correlated these values across subjects to test whether
205 the individual differences are stable and consistent. For robustness, we also
206 bootstrapped 100 random split-half partitions of trials for each subject and tested
207 whether β is correlated between the two halves. We transformed r values
cRT~Confidence
208 of correlations to z scores, averaged z scores obtained from 100 partitions, and
209 reported r values transformed from the averaged z scores.
211 In addition, we also examined the cRT-accuracy relationship. To measure the cRT-
212 accuracy relationship, we computed the differences in cRT between correct and
213 error trials (cRT – cRT ) for each subject. We performed linear regressions
correct error
214 on cRT – cRT as a function of groups to test the effects of groups on the cRT-
correct error
215 accuracy relationship, and examined the cRT-accuracy relationship across different
216 datasets. To determine the effect of accuracy on cRT at the population level, we
217 performed paired-sample t-tests comparing cRT for correct and error trials. We also
218 tested the cRT-accuracy relationship at the individual level by separately computing
219 cRT – cRT in odd and even trials for each subject and correlating these
correct error
221 partitions of trials for each subject for cRT – cRT .
correct error
223 Finally, to further assess the extent a single factor drives the response speed for
224 both the decision and the confidence rating, we computed the RT-cRT correlation
225 across subjects in each dataset.
227 All analyses were conducted in R software environment (Version 4.1.2). Bayes
228 factors were computed with the R package “BayesFactor” (Version 0.9.12-4.4).
229 Linear mixed-effects models were implemented with the R package “lmerTest”
230 (Version 3.1.3).
232 Data and code
234 Results
235 We investigated the nature of the cRT-confidence relationship. Specifically, we
236 adjudicated between the hypothesis that high confidence responses are inherently
237 made faster regardless of which confidence response is the most frequent
238 (Hypothesis 1) and the hypothesis that the most frequent confidence responses are
239 inherently made faster regardless of whether they are high or low (Hypothesis 2).
241 cRT-confidence relationship
243 Hypothesis 2, cRTs should be lowest for the more frequently used confidence rating.
244 If so, subjects who give low confidence most frequently should be fastest for low and
245 slowest for high confidence ratings, whereas subjects who give high confidence
246 most frequently should be fastest for high and slowest for low confidence ratings.
247 Conversely, Hypothesis 1 predicts that all subjects should be fastest for high and
248 slowest for low confidence ratings regardless of their most frequent confidence
249 rating. To compare the predictions of the two hypotheses, we divided subjects into
250 groups depending on their most frequent confidence ratings and examined which
251 confidence rating was made the fastest in each group. Consistent with Hypothesis 2,
252 the lowest cRTs always corresponded to the most frequent confidence levels in all
253 four groups in each of the three datasets (probability of this happening by chance

258 chosen confidence rating. (A) cRT for each possible confidence rating plotted
259 separately for each group formed based on the most frequent confidence rating (e.g.,
260 “Group k” consists of all subjects for whom k is the most frequently chosen
261 confidence rating). Horizontal dash lines indicate the lowest cRTs among the four
262 confidence levels in each group. (B) The cRT-confidence relationship, quantified as
263 β , for each of the groups formed based on the most frequent confidence

265 proportion of trials on which a subject used the most frequent rating. In accordance
266 with Hypothesis 2, we find positive relationships between β and the
cRT~Confidence
267 proportion of the most frequent confidence rating for group 1 but negative
268 relationships for group 4. Error bars show SEM. Each dot corresponds to one subject.
269 Solid lines indicate best-fitting regressions.
271 Beyond examining the identity of the most frequent confidence rating, we also
272 explored how the direction of the cRT-confidence relationship changed based on the
273 most frequent confidence rating. Hypothesis 2 predicts that the direction of this
274 relationship should switch from positive to negative for people who give low
275 confidence vs. high confidence most frequently. Conversely, Hypothesis 1 predicts
276 that the direction of this relationship should always be negative regardless of which
277 confidence rating is most frequent. For each of the three datasets, we found that
278 subjects in group 1 (who rated the lowest confidence level the most frequently)
279 show significant positive cRT-confidence relationship (quantified as the slope
280 β ) (Bang: t(49) = 5.94, p = 2.9×10-7, Cohen’s d = .84, BF = 5.2×104;
cRT~Confidence 10
281 Haddara1: t(31) = 2.87, p = .007, Cohen’s d = .51, BF = 5.70; Haddara2: t(19) = 4.14,
283 (who rated the highest confidence level the most frequently) show negative cRT-
284 confidence relationship (Bang: t(58) = -5.33, p = 1.7×10-6, Cohen’s d = -.69, BF =
285 9.8×103; Haddara1: t(190) = -14.75, p = 2.5×10-33, Cohen’s d = -1.07, BF = 1.1×1030;
286 Haddara2: t(8) = -1,90, p = .09, Cohen’s d = -.63, BF = 1.14). Analyzing all groups
287 together, we found that the slope of the cRT-confidence relationship (i.e.,
288 β ) decreases for the groups where the most frequent confidence rating is
cRT~Confidence
289 higher (Bang: slope = -34.66, t(199) = -9.12, p = 8.4×10-17, Cohen’s d = -.64;
290 Haddara1: slope = -35.05, t(440) = -10.34, p = 1.3×10-22, Cohen’s d = -.49; Haddara2:
292 strongly support Hypothesis 2 and demonstrate that the patterns in cRT results are
293 largely determined by the identity of the most frequently chosen confidence rating.
295 Beyond the differences between groups, Hypothesis 2 makes another prediction
296 about the variability expected within each group. Specifically, the effects within each
297 group should depend on the frequency of the most frequent rating. For example,
298 among subjects who rated confidence = 1 most frequently (i.e., group 1), subjects
299 with higher proportions of confidence = 1 responses should exhibit larger cRT-
300 confidence slopes (β ), which is exactly what we found (Bang: r = .48, p =
cRT~Confidence
302 Conversely, among subjects who rated confidence = 4 most frequently (i.e., group 4),
303 subjects with higher proportions of confidence = 4 responses should exhibit smaller
304 cRT-confidence slopes (β ), which is again what we found (Bang: r = -.62,
cRT~Confidence
305 p = 1.2×10-7; Haddara1: r = -.38, p = 6.7×10-8; Haddara2: r = -.75, p = .02). Therefore,
306 Hypothesis 2 is further supported by these within-group analyses (note that
307 Hypothesis 1 predicts no such correlations for any group).
309 Having strongly supported Hypothesis 2, we examined what that hypothesis
310 predicts regarding the overall cRT-confidence relationship when all subjects are
311 considered separately (i.e., the standard analysis in the literature; Moran et al., 2015;
312 Pleskac & Busemeyer, 2010). According to Hypothesis 2, given that different
313 subgroups show different directions of the cRT-confidence relationship, the
314 direction of the relationship in the whole group would be driven by the most
315 numerous subgroup. This is exactly what we found. In one dataset (Haddara1), most
317 result in a negative overall relationship between cRT and confidence in the whole
318 group. Indeed, we found a strong negative correlation between cRT and confidence
319 at the population level in Haddara1 (slope = -30.95, 95% CI = [-39.41, -22.47],
321 However, the other two datasets (Haddara2 and Bang) featured relatively more
323 relationships between cRT and confidence in the whole group. Indeed, we found no
324 significant correlation between cRT and confidence at the population level in
325 Haddara2 (slope = 6.20, 95% CI = [-12.95, 25.36], t(74.52) = .64, p = .52, Cohen’s d
327 11.78, 95% CI = [1.88, 21.68], t(186.92) = 2.34, p = .02, Cohen’s d = .17, BF10 = 1.16).
328 These results suggest that previous results of population-level negative cRT-
329 confidence relationship were likely due to most subjects having high confidence in
330 those datasets. Indeed, this type of bias is clearly present in the Moran et al. (2015)
333 confidence relationship is not fixed and depends on the overall level of bias toward
334 low or high confidence responses in each dataset.

346 cRT-accuracy relationship
347 Having shown that the cRT-confidence relationship is largely driven by the bias
348 toward low or high confidence responses, we further examined whether the cRT-
349 accuracy relationship is also driven by the same bias. Similar to the cRT-confidence
351 trials (cRT – cRT ) became smaller for the groups for which the most
correct error
352 frequent confidence rating was higher (Bang: slope = -18.80, t(199) = -4.24, p =
353 3.4×10-5, Cohen’s d = -.30; Haddara1: slope = -11.89, t(441) = -4.30, p = 2.1×10-5,
354 Cohen’s d = -.20; Haddara2: slope = -11.80, t(73) = -4.11, p = 1.0×10-4, Cohen’s d = -

359 BF = .07; Haddara2: t(74) = -.62, p = .54, Cohen’s d = -.07, BF = .15). These results

360 show that just as the cRT-confidence relationship, the cRT-accuracy relationship is

373 Finally, we examined the correlations between RT and cRT to test whether the
374 overall speed in decision and confidence responses may be related. Indeed, we
375 found strong across-subject correlations between RT and cRT (Bang: r = .69, p =
376 2.1×10-29, BF = 1.5×1026; Haddara1: r = .59, p = 2.8×10-43, BF = 7.5×1039;

385 Discussion
386 We set to adjudicate between two competing hypotheses regarding confidence
387 response time (cRT): Hypothesis 1, which proposes that high confidence responses
388 are inherently made faster regardless of which confidence response is the most
389 frequent, and Hypothesis 2, which proposes that the most frequent confidence
390 responses are inherently made faster regardless of whether they are high or low.
391 Several previous studies found a negative cRT-confidence relationship in the group
392 as a whole (Herregods et al., 2023; Moran et al., 2015; Pleskac & Busemeyer, 2010).
393 The authors interpreted these results as evidence for Hypothesis 1 and used them to
394 motivate models where confidence is based on a post-decision evidence
395 accumulation process. Here we compared the predictions of the two hypotheses
396 using three large datasets from the Confidence Database. We found that the most
397 frequent confidence responses were made faster regardless of whether confidence
398 was high or low, supporting Hypothesis 2 and rejecting Hypothesis 1. These findings
399 reveal the factors driving confidence response times and challenge several post-
400 decisional models of confidence.
402 To be clear, our results do not falsify all post-decisional models of confidence. Three
403 prominent post-decisional models – the 2DSD model with optional stopping
404 (Pleskac & Busemeyer, 2010), the collapsing confidence boundary model (Moran et
405 al., 2015), and the recent Herregods et al. model (Herregods et al., 2023) – postulate
406 that cRT is intrinsically negatively related to confidence (Hypothesis 1 above).
407 Therefore, by falsifying Hypothesis 1, our results directly challenge these models.
408 However, there are other post-decisional confidence models that assume constant
409 post-decisional evidence accumulation time (Pleskac & Busemeyer, 2010). For
410 example, unlike the 2DSD model with optional stopping which allows
411 interjudgement time to vary between trials, the main 2DSD model just treats the
412 interjudgment time as a constant exogenous parameter in the model (Pleskac &
413 Busemeyer, 2010). While the original versions of these models are also challenged
414 by the current results (because these models do not predict that cRT would vary
415 with the frequency of the confidence rating), it should be possible to augment these
416 models with extra parameters that make the interjudgement time dependent on the
417 frequency of the confidence response.
419 We also want to clarify that our results do not challenge the notion that information
420 arriving after the decision can be used to influence the eventual confidence rating.
421 There is considerable behavioral and neural evidence confidence judgments can
422 indeed be influenced by information or processing that occurs after the initial
423 decision has been made (Boldt & Yeung, 2015; Desender et al., 2021; Pereira et al.,
424 2020). It is important to note, however, that while many models do not explicitly
425 incorporate the possible influences of information coming after the decision,
426 virtually all existing models of metacognition (Fleming & Daw, 2017; Green & Swets,
427 1966; Jang et al., 2012; Maniscalco & Lau, 2016; Rausch et al., 2018; Shekhar &
428 Rahnev, 2021) can be extended to do so if desired.
430 Why are the most frequent confidence ratings made faster? One possible mechanism
431 is that the motor system is able to execute more frequent actions faster (Katzner &
432 Miller, 2012; Mattes et al., 2002; Miller, 1998; Näätänen, 1971). Specifically, low
433 response frequency is thought to lead to poor motor preparation, which results in
434 slower responses (Näätänen, 1971). The motor influence on response speed has
435 been confirmed by the finding that lateralized readiness potential (an
436 electrophysiological indicator of motor preparation) is larger for more frequent
437 responses (Eimer, 1998; Miller, 1998), and by showing that the correlation cannot
438 be explained by properties of external stimuli, such as the frequency of different
439 stimuli (Katzner & Miller, 2012; Mattes et al., 2002). Our findings extend this
440 previous work to confidence judgments and suggest that motor influences might
441 underlie the relationship between the response frequency and cRT.
443 Although our work here focused on cRT, our findings raise questions regarding
444 potential influences for decision RTs too. Indeed, similar to the results here, it is
445 commonly found that subjects are faster for the choices they give more frequently
446 (de Lange et al., 2013; Rahnev et al., 2011). However, such contingencies are usually
447 assumed to arise exclusively from the evidence accumulation process (e.g., as a
448 consequence of a biased starting point of the accumulation) (Brown & Heathcote,
449 2008; Ratcliff & McKoon, 2008; Ratcliff & Smith, 2004). Indeed, classical evidence
450 accumulation models of decision-making such as DDM usually decompose RTs into
451 decision and non-decision time, and assume that the non-decision time is constant
452 across all choices regardless of differences in the frequency of different choices
453 (Ratcliff & McKoon, 2008; Ratcliff & Smith, 2004). Our findings cast doubt on this
454 assumption and suggest that more frequent choices have lower RTs not only
455 because of effects related to the decision process (e.g., starting point or drift rate
456 bias), but also due to non-decision times that are faster for more frequent choices.
458 In conclusion, our work shows that cRT and confidence are not intrinsically related,
459 and instead cRT is simply lower for the most frequent confidence responses. These
460 results strongly challenge several post-decision evidence accumulation models,
461 constrain future theories of confidence generation, and suggest the need for more
462 careful examination of standard accumulation-to-bound theories of perceptual
463 decision making.
