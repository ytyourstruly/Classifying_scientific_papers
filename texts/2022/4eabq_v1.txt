BSTRACT
The aim of this work was to develop a valid and reliable scale to measure Basic Psychological Need
Satisfaction for technology use (BPN-TU). According to the Self-Determination Theory, satisfaction
of the Basic Psychological Needs (BPNs) for Autonomy, Competence, and Relatedness is crucial to
well-being and autonomous motivation. Research into the role of BPN Satisfaction in technology use
is scarce, partly due to a lack of appropriate measuring tools. To develop a pool of original BPN-TU
scale items, we held 10 interviews. Based on these items, we conducted four validation studies
with four independent samples (total N = 821), collecting user responses to different technologies:
digital voice assistant, exoskeleton, chatbot and social robot. Good model fit was supported by
confirmatory factor analyses for a twelve-item scale, containing three items each for satisfaction of
users’ Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness to Others, and Relatedness to Technology. The scale was
validated in English and German.

1 Introduction
Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction is a key factor in explaining people’s autonomous motivation (volitional, self-
directed motivation) and overall well-being [Deci et al., 2008, Ryan and Deci, 2000a]. The Basic Psychological Needs
Theory (BPNT; [Deci and Ryan, 2000, Ryan and Deci, 2000b]) is one of six so called “mini theories” forming the
Self-Determination Theory (SDT; [Deci and Ryan, 1985]) that established three universal Basic Psychological Needs
(BPNs):
• Autonomy, i.e. feeling control over one’s own decisions and actions ,
• Competence, i.e. experiencing effectance and mastery of a task, and
• Relatedness, i.e. caring for others and being cared for in return.
Many studies from education [Tian et al., 2014a, Wang et al., 2019], physical exercise [Balaguer et al., 2012, Gunnell
et al., 2014, Li et al., 2013], and work [Deci and Ryan, 2014, Williams et al., 2014, Ilies et al., 2017] contexts have
referenced the importance of BPN Satisfaction to people’s motivation and well-being.
More recently, BPN Satisfaction has also attracted attention from the technology sector, as some user studies have
addressed the importance of users’ Need Satisfaction to their intention to use technological devices [see e.g., De Vreede
et al., 2021, Moradbakhti et al., 2022, Jiménez-Barreto et al., 2021], revealing that BPN Satisfaction is a good predictor
of technology acceptance, even when compared to classic predictors of technology acceptance, such as Ease of Use and
Perceived Usefulness (anonymized for submission).

Given the increasing use of technologies in our daily lives, user well-being – to which BPN Satisfaction could
significantly contribute in the long-term – should be a key priority of developers [Peters and Calvo, 2021, Peters, 2022,
Moradbakhti et al., 2022]. In the context of experiments and analyses based on user-centered design, more studies
could therefore focus on measures of BPN Satisfaction, specifically, if we acknowledge that technologies in many cases
developed to i) become more autonomous (e.g., autonomous vehicles; Chen and Chen [2021]), ii) be more efficient
and competent (e.g., algorithmic decision systems; Hou and Jung [2021]), iii) replace human contact (e.g., customer
service chatbots; Haugeland et al. [2022]) and iv) provide new ways of social interaction with others (e.g., social media;
Roberts and David [2020]).
The current work introduces a tool for researchers and practitioners to measure Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction
in human-technology interaction contexts. Across four individual studies with a total N of 821, we developed a scale for
the assessment of Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction for Technology Use (BPN-TU). The scale does not only follow
a strong validation procedure, it was also developed to fit and be easily adaptable to various different technologies and
contexts. This makes the BPN-TU scale not only a valuable contribution to the HCI community, it is also applicable to
areas of Engineering Psychology, User Experience research and related fields in both empirical research and practice.
2 Related Work
2.1 Need Satisfaction and Technology
In comparison to other domains such as education, physical exercise, or work, the Need for Relatedness comprises
two aspects in the context of technology interaction: On the one hand, technologies can mediate people’s Need for
Relatedness to Others (e.g., communication technology), and on the other, people can also feel relatedness to the
technology itself (e.g., companion robot). For example, relatedness to others can be studied in the domain of video
gaming when users play online with other human players or cooperatively in the same room using the same console
where the technology (here: gaming console) functions as a mediator [see e.g., Johannes et al., 2021, Vuorre et al.,
2022]. The relatedness to the technology itself, for example, can be imagined to play an important role in social robotics
where a humanoid robot is often assumed to be perceived as some kind of “social actor” [see e.g., Nass and Moon,
2000, Leichtmann and Nitsch, 2021]. Against the background of technology use, need satisfaction could therefore be
divided as follows: Autonomy Need, Competence Need, Need for Relatedness to Others, and Need for Relatedness to
the Technology.
Previous research pointed towards the positive influence BPN Satisfaction has on technology use. For example, studies
revealed that BPN Satisfaction led to higher acceptance of a chatbot [De Vreede et al., 2021], more positive customer
experience with a service chatbot [Jiménez-Barreto et al., 2021] and higher acceptance of in-vehicle gesture interaction
with an automotive user interface [Stiegemeier et al., 2022].
Furthermore, a review of 110 CHI and CHI PLAY papers confirmed the growing interest from online game design and
player experience studies in the SDT and the theoretical concepts of intrinsic motivation and need satisfaction [Tyack
and Mekler, 2020]. In the domain of gamification, Sailer et al. [Sailer et al., 2017] indicated that specific online game
design factors would be able to support users’ BPN Satisfaction and subsequently motivation. Specifically, the needs
for Competence and Autonomy were satisfied more strongly by leaderboard and performance graphs while Relatedness
was supported by avatars and teammates. A study by Reer et al. [2022] showed that Virtual Reality (VR) had a positive
impact on users’ Competence and Autonomy Need Satisfaction as well as game enjoyment, in comparison to the same
game without VR.
For user experience design, BPN Satisfaction has proven to have a positive influence on users’ experience when
interacting with technologies. Pioneering the idea of involving psychological need assessment in user experience,
Hassenzahl et al. [2010] analysed over 500 positive experiences with interactive technologies while assessing user’s
fulfillment of 10 psychological needs based on Sheldon et al. [2001]. The results revealed that specifically the fulfillment
of the Competence and Relatedness Need, amongst other factors such as stimulation and popularity, are key drivers for
positive affect in technology interaction. Multiple user experience studies have followed this approach and assessed the
importance of Sheldon’s psychological needs for user experience and technology design [see e.g., Frison et al., 2019,
Lallemand et al., 2014, Karapanos et al., 2015, Partala and Kallinen, 2012, Tuch et al., 2013]. Interestingly, the original
study by Sheldon et al. [2001] pointed out that the needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness (in line with the
SDT) were always amongst the top 4 needs when determining the most fundamental needs for humans across three
studies. In support of this, the METUX (Motivation, Engagement and Thriving in User Experience) model was formed,
to provide a framework for designers and developers to consider BPN Satisfaction at six different stages “spheres",
of technology use and interaction (technology adoption, interface interaction, technology enabled task, technology
supported behaviour, life impact and societal impact) [Peters et al., 2018]. Integrating the BPN in design practices
BPN-TU Scale
A P
REPRINT
would benefit both, the developers, as BPN Satisfaction fosters user engagement, as well as the users, due to the positive
effects on their well-being.
Moreover, several ethical guidelines and frameworks were formed over the recent years [see e.g., Chatila et al., 2017,
Ikonen et al., 2009, Jones et al., 2014] to establish principles for the development of autonomous systems, highlighting
the importance of human autonomy and user well-being. For example, the Association for Computing Machinery
(ACM) has established the following point as their first principle of ethical conduct: “Contribute to society and to
human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.", pointing toward the importance of
considering user well-being in the processes of computing [Gotterbarn et al., 2018]. Since, according SDT and BPN
theory, users’ well-being is the outcome of BPN Satisfaction, their integration in technology design would facilitate the
conformity with ethical standards.
Considering the results from the studies outlined above, the relevance of BPN Satisfaction for user engagement and
well-being is evident. Therefore, it is important that BPN Satisfaction is taken into consideration in future human-
computer interaction (HCI) studies and design processes for new technologies. For example, Peters and Calvo [Peters
and Calvo, 2021] have created guidelines to integrate BPN Satisfaction in user experience design practices with a
focus on factors that support users’ well-being. However, to integrate BPN Satisfaction in technology design and HCI
research, appropriate and validated measures, for BPN Satisfaction in the technology context, are needed.
2.2 Measurement of Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction
BPN Satisfaction has to date been measured with various tools, such as the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction and
Frustration Scale (BPNSFS; [Chen et al., 2015]), the Balanced Measure of Psychological Needs (BMPNs; [Sheldon
and Hilpert, 2012]) and the Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction Scale (BPNS; [Ilardi et al., 1993]). Further, a variety
of scales were adapted to specific contexts, such as the Basic Psychological Needs in Exercise Scale [Vlachopoulos
et al., 2010], the Basic Psychological Needs at School Scale [Tian et al., 2014b], and the Basic Psychological Needs at
Work Scale [Brien et al., 2012].
However, there is no specific BPN scale tailored to technology use. Previous studies assessing BPN Satisfaction
in broader user experience design contexts [e.g., Hassenzahl et al., 2010, Karapanos et al., 2015, Lallemand et al.,
2014, Partala and Kallinen, 2012, Tuch et al., 2013], automotive user interface design [Stiegemeier et al., 2022], or
during chatbot interaction [e.g., De Vreede et al., 2021, Jiménez-Barreto et al., 2021, Moradbakhti et al., 2022] have
used individually adapted versions of the existing scales to measure BPN Satisfaction. Even though the studies have
confirmed the significance and influence of BPN Satisfaction for HCI research, the inconsistent use of measures is
problematic in terms of comparability between studies and their replicability. As suggested by Scheel et al. [2021],
studies should refrain from prematurely testing hypotheses before having developed sound measurements. Moreover,
hypotheses can only be measured if the construct of interest is accurately applied in the study. If a study fails to apply
a valid measure, theoretical inferences cannot be made as the findings could equally so measure random noise or a
related but nevertheless distinct construct [Scheel et al., 2021]. Specifically, in HCI and user experience studies, scale
development procedures are not commonly used [Bargas-Avila and Hornbæk, 2011] which highlights the necessity to
introduce the benefits of applying validated scales to the HCI research community [see for example a recent discussion
in the human-robot interaction community Leichtmann et al., 2022].
2.3 The Present Study
The present study aimed to develop a validated scale for measuring BPNS in the context of technology use: The
Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction in Technology Use Scale (BPN-TU scale). Since no proper BPN scale that is
adapted to the technology context has to date been rigorously developed and validated, studies have used individually
adapted versions of existing BPN scales [e.g., Chen et al., 2015, Moradbakhti et al., 2022, Sheldon and Hilpert, 2012]
thereby impeding comparability of results across studies. Our contribution will allow HCI researchers to use a solid and
validated scale across contexts and technologies, both simplifying and strengthening current methods of assessing BPN
Satisfaction in technology use.
Further, to date, no study has addressed the potential two-fold nature of the Need for Relatedness in technology use,
proper exploration of which is impossible with existing BPN scales. The current scale was furthermore designed in a
way that it can be used widely in future studies addressing BPN in the context of a variety of different technologies as it
is not limited to a specific application. We chose four technologies to prove the applicability of the scale to different
contexts and technologies. We conducted the first study with an AI Voice Assistant in a banking context and a second
study with an AI Voice Assistant in a virtual reality game. To focus on the Relatedness to Others Need, we ran a
study with an exoskeleton (non-interactive technology) simulating factory work. Lastly, we conducted a study with an

assistive robot for in-home rehabilitation. Taken together, we believe that we cover diverse fields of application and
technologies and highly encourage other studies to expand on the current examples.
To ensure construct validity, we conducted four separate studies and analyzed the structure of the BPN-TU scale using
confirmatory factor analyses, to test if the theoretical constructs according to the BPN theory are reflected (see 1).
Invariance testing (with studies 1 to 3) in a final step, after confirming the construct structure in each study separately,
will allow to test if in fact the same construct is being measured across different technologies. Furthermore, we run
correlation analyses with the BPN items and other existing constructs, to assess the discriminant and convergent validity
of the new BPN-TU scale (study 1) for which the BPN scale should be different or similar according to theory. Lastly,
we also measured the predictive validity of the BPN scale by testing its relationship with the intention to use the
technologies in studies 1 and 4.
3 Method
Development and validation of The Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction for Technology Use Scale (BPN-TU)
comprised five separate steps (see 1). To ensure sound methodology, we followed best practice guidelines for the scale
development [see e.g., Boateng et al., 2018, Cronbach and Meehl, 1955].
3.1 Item Generation
First, a pool of 85 items in German was created based on existing BPN scales (German adaptation of the BPNSFS by
Heissel at al., 2019; [Sheldon and Hilpert, 2012]) and additional items that were expected to fit the technology context
(e.g. "When I use _, I feel like my social circle reacts positively to my use of _"; "I can imagine building a bond with
_" or "When I use _, I feel like the interaction goes both ways."). Since some items were very similar to each other
and only phrased differently, we markedly reduced the overall item number. Considering both aspects of the Need for
Relatedness in the technology context, we created items for four need categories: Autonomy Need, Competence Need,
Need for Relatedness to Others, Need for Relatedness to Technology.
These items were evaluated in individual interviews with five experts using the thinking-aloud method [Ericsson and
Simon, 1993]. The interviews lasted an hour each and were conducted via Zoom. All experts had a strong background
in human-machine interaction, and collectively they had experience of a wide range of technologies. In each interview,
the interviewer went through the potential items step-by-step while the experts openly discussed their thoughts, concerns
and preferences. Some experts also proposed additional items. Based on all five expert opinions, the item pool was
further modified and reduced. The chosen items, were items for which the majority of experts expressed a preference,
e.g. they thought of it as a useful addition to measure the construct. Finally, the items were also evaluated by five lay
people (no background in human-technology interaction research and no tertiary education) via the thinking-aloud
method to ensure understandability of the items to a wider audience. The interviews lasted between 30 minutes and 1
hour and were conducted in person or via Zoom. Based on these 10 interviews, the original item pool was reviewed by
the authors, adapted and reduced to 24 items.
3.2 Study 1: BPN Satisfaction for the interaction with a Banking Bot
The purpose of Study 1 was to provide initial validation of the 4x6 factor model (4 factors for the 4 BPN with 6
indicators each) according to the BPN theory (construct validity) and to test alternative models in order to find the
best-fitting model. The technology used for this study was a “Banking bot”, a chatbot for everyday banking activities. In
addition to the need scale, we also included variables from existing models (e.g. the Unified Theory of Acceptance and
Use of Technology (UTAUT);[Venkatesh et al., 2003]) to examine correlations between the constructs. The correlations
can provide information on whether the measured constructs of the new scale are different or similar to other constructs
used in HCI research (discriminant and convergent validity). In addition, we can assess if the BPN constructs can
predict relevant outcomes of HCI (predictive validity).

The chosen constructs are relevant and often referred to in HCI literature, such as anthropomorphism [see e.g., Epley
et al., 2007, Eyssel et al., 2011, 2012] which based on theory, can be linked to the Relatedness to Technology Need;
as well as the UTAUT [see e.g., Venkatesh et al., 2003, Attuquayefio and Addo, 2014] which has previously been
linked to the SDT and BPN Satisfaction [see e.g., Alowayr and Al-Azawei, 2021, Hsieh, 2022, Osei et al., 2022, Hsu,
2021]. Specifically, we were interested in including the UTAUT factors Social Influence and Performance Expectancy,
as we see a theoretical link between Social Influence and Relatedness to Others, as well as Performance Expectancy
and the Needs for Autonomy and Competence. Similarly, we chose to include measures of Warmth and Competence,
as we expect a relationship between Relatedness and Warmth perceptions, as well as Competence perception of the
technology and users own Competence Satisfaction [Bergmann et al., 2012]. We included Perceived Behavioural
Control as it was previously linked to users’ autonomy perceptions [see e.g., Shen et al., 2022], particularly in the
context of autonomous driving [Rödel et al., 2014]. Lastly, Self-Identity has previously been linked to social identity
and self-concepts in relation to technology [Cheng and Guo, 2015], so called ‘ÌT identity" [Carter and Grover, 2015], as
well as autonomy [Wiklund-Engblom et al., 2009]. We therefore expect Self-Identity to be linked to the Relatedness
Needs and Autonomy.
3.2.1 Participants
322 Austrian participants were recruited via the online panel provider Respondi. 33 additional participants were
recruited from university courses (in Psychology and Computer Science), via internal university staff and student
newsletters, and our lab’s Facebook page. The final sample consisted of N = 355 (177 females, 176 males, 2 non-binary,
M = 44.18, Range = 16 − 75, SD = 15.19).

3.2.2 Measures
• The Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction for Technology
Use Scale (BPN-TU): was assessed with four items per need and 24 items in total. The items were rated
on a five-point Likert scale from 1 (does not apply at all) to 5 (fully applies). The final (shortened) English
version of the BPN-TU scale can be seen below 5, the final (shortened) German BPN-TU scale can be seen in
Appendix A, and the original German 4x6 item scale can be found in Appendix B.
• UTAUT Performance Expectancy: was assessed with five items based on the original model (see Venkatesh
et al. [2003]). An example item was: “The usage of the Banking Bot increases my effectiveness.” The items
were rated on a five-point Likert scale from 1 (does not apply at all) to 5 (fully applies).
• UTAUT Social Influence: was assessed with three items based on the original model (see Venkatesh et al.
[2003]). An example item was: “People that are important to me think I should use the Banking Bot”. The
items were rated on a five-point Likert scale from 1 (does not apply at all) to 5 (fully applies).
• Perceived Behavioural Control (PBC): was assessed with
three items based on the extended version [Ajzen, 1985] of the Theory of Reasoned Action [Fishbein et al.,
1975]. An example item was: ”It is easy for me to get the Banking Bot to do what I want“. The items were
rated on a five-point Likert scale from 1 (does not apply at all) to 5 (fully applies).
• Self-Identity: was assessed with two items based on Self-Identity items that were previously used by
Lee et al. [Lee et al., 2001, 2006]. An example item was: "The use of the Banking Bot would represent my
personal values.". The items were rated on a five-point Likert scale from 1 (does not apply at all) to 5 (fully
applies).
• Warmth & Competence: was assessed with three items to measure competence (e.g., “How competent did
you perceive the Banking Bot?”) and three items to measure warmth (e.g., “How warmhearted did you
perceive the Banking Bot”). These items were based on the classic constructs of warmth and competence as
established by Fiske et al.,[Fiske et al., 2007] that have previously been applied in studies in the domain of
human-technology interaction [Bergmann et al., 2012]. The items were rated on a five-point Likert scale from
1 (does not apply at all) to 5 (fully applies).
• Anthropomorphism: was assessed as a semantic differential based on the Godspeed scale [Bartneck et al.,
2009].
• Dependent Variable: Intention to Use: participants’ intention to use the Banking Bot (see Technol-
ogy Acceptance Model (TAM); Davis [1989]) was assessed with two items: "I could imagine to use the robot
in the future." and "I would like to inform myself about products that are similar to this robot.". The items
were rated on a five-point Likert scale from 1 (does not apply at all) to 5 (fully applies)

• Additional Variables: in addition to the variables mentioned above, participant age, gender, openness to
technology and previous experience with technology were assessed. Since these variables were not relevant to
scale development, we do not elaborate on their measurement in more detail.

This study was an online study with video vignettes of a chatbot “Banking Bot” for everyday banking activities (a
would later evaluate. They first provided their demographic information and were then randomly assigned to one of
four video conditions. Each video followed the same style of introduction, but the text the chatbot would use in each
condition to introduce its services was slightly varied to address one need specifically. After watching the videos,
participants were instructed to complete the questionnaires on BPN-TU, UTAUT Performance Expectancy, etc. Finally,
participants were debriefed and redirected to Respondi’s platform to process their financial compensation. Participants
received C0.50 as an incentive for their participation (approx. 10 minutes).

3.2.4 Results and Discussion
Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed using the Diagonally Weighted Least Squares estimator (DWLS), as
the variables for the need scale were originally categorical variables [Mindrila, 2010]. In line with suggestions on how
to treat ordinal data in factor analyses, we did code the categorical variables as continuous [Robitzsch, 2020]; [Savalei,
2021]. Moreover, we also ran the analyses with the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator for comparison, the results of
which confirmed good fit and can be found in Appendix C.
The fit of the model was evaluated using conventional fit indices [e.g., Brown, 2015, Mair, 2018]: the χ goodness-of-fit
statistics as well as the Comparative Fit Index (CFI; good fit > .95), the Tucker Lewis Index (TLI; good fit > .95),
the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA; good fit ≤ .06), and the Standardized Root Mean Square
Residual (SRMR; good fit ≤ .08). Based on these evaluation standards, the model exhibited a good model fit (see 2).

items (Autonomy 4, Relatedness to Others 2 and Relatedness to Technology 4), Competence 1 and Competence 4 did
not have as good factor loadings as the other items (λ < .60) and were therefore excluded. Excluding these items,

Model 3 (4x3 factors) 25.36 48 1.00 1.01 0.00 0.04 1.00
we performed another confirmatory factor analysis and assessed the modification indices. With a cut-off of 15, we
discarded one more item: Autonomy 6. After removal of these six items, no further items needed to be excluded based
on the modification indices. This resulted in a factor model with the following items: 4 Autonomy items (1,2,3,5); 4
Competence items (2,3,5,6); 5 Relatedness to Others items (1,3,4,5,6) and 5 Relatedness to Technology items (1,2,3,5,6).
The model resulted in a good fit (see 2). Due to the nature of HCI studies that often involve either lab based or video
based (in online studies) interaction with a technology, lengthy questionnaires are impractical and go beyond the
scope of acceptable time frames for user studies. Therefore, we sought to further reduce the item number and tested a
12-item version (see 2) which resulted in a similarly good fit when compared with the other models (see 2). Moreover,
McDonald’s ω suggests good reliability for all 4 BPN: Autonomy ω = .90; Competence ω = .87; Relatedness to
Others ω = .84; Relatedness to Technology ω = .84.
to the other constructs included in this study, as no correlations exceeded .85 (Brown [2015]), this means that the
BPN scale measures in fact different constructs compared to scales aiming to measure other constructs because one
would expect high correlation coefficients if the same constructs is being measured. In addition to this, we conducted
Based on the evaluation standards, model fit was good: χ = 221.64, df = 505, p = 1.00, CF I = 1.00, T LI = 1.01,
RM SEA = 0.00, SRM R = 0.03. This suggests that the BPN-TU factors are distinct from the other constructs
confirming the assumption of discriminant validity.
However, we can see moderate to high correlations between all constructs. According to Meehl[Meehl, 1967] and
Peter[Peter, 1981], correlations between constructs from the same sample are highly likely, if the sample is large
and reliability is given (at least to some degree). On the one hand, high correlations between theoretically related
constructs were expected, as for example high correlations between the UTAUT Performance Expectancy scale and
the Competence Satisfaction rs = .71, n = 355, p < .01, as well as the Autonomy Satisfaction rs = .68, n = 355,
p < .01. In line with our expectations, Anthropomorphism also highly correlated with the Relatedness to Technology
Satisfaction (rs = .60, n = 355, p < .01). On the other hand, high correlations also occurred between constructs
that were not expected, such as a correlation between the Self-Identity construct and the Competence Satisfaction
(rs = .70, n = 355, p < .01), as well as Anthropomorphism and the Competence Satisfaction (rs = .60, n = 355,
p < .01) which could be interpreted as a drawback. Overall, correlations with theoretically linked constructs confirm a
certain degree of convergent validity. Discriminant validity can also be assumed to a certain degree in that correlation
coefficients do not exceed .85, even though discriminant validity appears to be somewhat diminished by the fact that
high correlations were found that would actually be expected to be low. We discuss potential explanations for the
unexpectedly high correlations between constructs in the limitation section of this paper.
We also measured the predictive validity of the BPN Satisfaction items for the Intention to Use the Banking Bot.
The Autonomy Satisfaction and Intention to Use had a correlation of r = .64, n = 355, p < .01, the Competence
Satisfaction and Intention to Use correlated at r = .68, n = 355, p < .01, the Relatedness to Others Satisfaction and
Intention to Use r = .53, n = 355, p < .01 and Relatedness to Technology Satisfaction and Intention to Use r = .57,

n = 355, p < .01. As the correlation coefficients are all medium ranging from .53 to .68, a considerable degree of
predictive power can be assumed.

3.3 Study 2: BPN Satisfaction for the Usage of an Exoskeleton in an Industrial Context
In study 2 we tested whether the 4x3 factor model of BPN (that is 4 needs with 3 items each, see Model 3) would also
be a good fit for data of the new sample using a different technology. To assess whether the scale could be applied to a
wide range of different technologies, we used an active exoskeleton (active exoskeletons are used to either enhance
human strength or to reduce the energy consumption of the body) in Study 2. Since exoskeletons are non-interactive, the
Satisfaction of the Need for Relatedness to Technology items were not included in this study. However, as exoskeletons
can have influence on how workers are perceived by other co-workers, we assessed the Satisfaction of the Need for

Relatedness to Others. Study 2 was part of a larger research project and more constructs had been measured in this
study, but here we only report measures that were relevant to scale development.
3.3.1 Participants
In total, 120 (73 males, 46 females, 1 non-binary, M = 28.43, Range = 18 − 62, SD = 9.20) participants
age age age
took part in the laboratory study. Participants were recruited from an elective class for Computer Science and Artificial
Intelligence university students and via internal university staff and student newsletters and our lab’s Facebook page.
3.3.2 Measures and Procedure
Study 2 was conducted in a laboratory setting on an Austrian university campus. Participants were required to complete
a series of tasks wearing the exoskeleton “Ironhand” (Bioservo). The tasks included activities typical of work in
industrial settings where the exoskeleton would support workers (e.g., riveting, screwing). Before starting, participants
read an information sheet and were told that they would be trying out the exoskeleton for a company producing
wooden kitchens, and that they were to test and provide feedback on how the individual tasks could be performed with
Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: i) in condition one, participants were told that they
should imagine themselves working alone with the exoskeleton in the company, as the company was planning to buy it
for only one person due to its high cost; ii) in condition two, participants were told that the company was planning to
provide all workers with this exoskeleton, so they should imagine themselves working in an environment where multiple
workers would wear it. This manipulation can impact the Need for Relatedness to Others but since participant’s were
almost equally assigned to both conditions is not of further relevance for the scale development. Once participants had
finished the tasks, they used a tablet to complete a questionnaire and were then debriefed by an instructor.
Additional measures that were assessed are not included here, as they were not relevant to scale development.

The factor loading for the Relatedness to Others item 3 (When I use __, I feel less alone.) is lower in comparison to the
other factor loadings and McDonald’s ω is also below the desired threshold of .70. This may be the case due to the
artificiality of the laboratory environment, which only to a certain extent simulates an actual workplace with otherwise
strong social embedding, as participants worked alone in the laboratory and were simply asked to imagine themselves
working with others in the factory.
In sum, study 2 confirmed the factor structure of the BPN-TU scale with an active exoskeleton as the technology of
interest.
3.4 Study 3: BPN Satisfaction for the interaction with an AI Voice Assistant
Study 3 was the second confirmatory study to test whether the 3x4 model structure would also fit the data of a new
sample using a different technology, a voice assistant as a decision support. Again, tests were performed in a laboratory
setting, but this time the technology encountered was an Artificial Intelligence (AI) voice assistant that participants could
interact with in a Virtual Reality (VR) game environment. Concerning the Satisfaction of the Need for Relatedness,
study 2 tested only the Satisfaction of the Need for Relatedness to Others with the voice assistant being expected to be
perceived as the interaction partner that people feel related to. Study 3 thus complemented study 2 by testing only the

3.4.2 Measures and Procedure
Study 3 was a VR lab study conducted on an Austrian university campus. Participants received an information sheet
and entered their demographic information on a tablet before starting the VR game. The game was based on the
concept of escape games, and participants were tasked with saving the fictitious planet “Xiranda” by creating a healing
serum while solving several riddles and puzzles. If needed, participants would receive help from an AI voice assistant
that was not visible to them, but they could hear the voice throughout the game. An impression of the VR game

While the manipulation of the AI voice was important in the larger project, we do not report results of the manipulation
on the BPN factors as no effects are expected and it is not important for the scale development). Once the game was

over, participants completed questionnaires on a tablet computer (including the BPN-TU scale) and were then debriefed
by an instructor.
Additional measures that were assessed are not included here, as they were not relevant to scale development.
3.4.3 Results and Discussion
was performed using the DWLS estimator, and for ML estimation see Appendix C. Based on the evaluation standards,
the model fit the data well (see 6): χ = 12.39, df = 24, p = 0.98, CF I = 1.00, T LI = 1.02, RM SEA = 0.00,
SRM R = 0.05. McDonald’s ω suggests good reliability for Autonomy ω = .86 and Competence ω = .76; and
moderate reliability for Relatedness to Technology ω = .68.
The results thus show, that the new BPN-TU scale also worked in a VR setting where participants interacted with a
voice assistant. This gives hints that the scale can be used with different technologies.
3.5 Invariance Testing across Studies 1-3
The confirmatory factor models reported in the studies separately revealed good fit to the theoretical structure for
different samples and different technologies including a chatbot, an exoskeleton, and a voice assistant in different settings
of online, lab, and VR studies. However, it remains unclear, if the models are comparable also in characteristics other
than the general model structure. To avoid hidden invalidity, scales should also be tested for invariance across different
groups [Hussey and Hughes, 2020]. Thus, we tested the measurement invariance across the different technologies
from studies 1-3 to ensure its equivalence across technology groups. As the fit of the Relatedness Satisfaction items
depends on the technology type and is thus expected to vary depending on the technology by theory, we excluded the
items in our measurement invariance test. Invariance testing included the Autonomy and Competence Satisfaction
items and comprised four steps: configural invariance testing (equivalence of factor structure), metric invariance testing
(equivalence of factor loadings across groups), scalar invariance testing (equivalence of intercepts across groups) and
BIC value (Bayesian Information Criterion) characterizes the best-fitting model. Our results showed metric invariance
and therefore also configural invariance. Thus, invariance testing confirmed that our BPN-TU scale is a good tool for
measuring BPN Satisfaction across different technologies.

4 General Discussion
In this article we presented the profound development and extensive validation of a new scale to measure the Basic
Psychological Need Satisfaction in the context of human-technology interaction (the BPN-TU scale) with empirical
data from 4 different studies. The scale validation confirmed a good model fit for the 3x4 factor model including the
needs for Autonomy, Competence and Relatedness.
Moreover, the current study introduced the concept of distinguishing between two types of Need for Relatedness with
regard to technology interaction, namely Relatedness to Others with the technology serving as a potential mediator
of interpersonal relations (e.g., when the technology of interest is an exoskeleton, see study 2) and Relatedness to
Technology itself (e.g., when the technology of interest is an interactive AI-based voice assistant, see study 3).
As can be seen from confirmatory factor analyses, a four-factor structure revealed a good fit to the data across all four
studies and – depending on the interactivity of the technology – one of the need for relatedness factors can be removed
if inapplicable to the context or technology. As confirmed by invariance testing for the Autonomy and Competence
Need Satisfaction, the BPN-TU scale is applicable to a variety of technologies and contexts. The current scale can
thus be applied to different technologies without modification of the items, other than adding the technology to be
studies. These steps confirm the construct validity of the scale.
In addition to this, correlative analyses with other constructs in study 1 showed that the scale can also be rated positively
in terms of discriminant and convergent validity. Our analyses revealed that the BPN-TU scale is linked to existing
constructs in current use in technology contexts to assess user sentiments towards technological devices, such as the
UTAUT Performance Expectancy scale (see 2) showing some degree of convergent validity. Yet, we were able to
provide evidence that the BPN-TU items can be distinguished from the other scales indicated by moderately, but not
perfect correlation coefficients, as well as by a model test including other constructs modeled as separate factors showing
good model fit (see study 1). However, it needs to be mentioned, that we also found moderate to high correlations with
the BPN-TU factors to factors we did not expect to have a significant relationship. This does not necessarily need to
mean that this reduces the validity of one of the scales as as such correlations could also be attributed to i) common
method bias (study 1 was an online study and all questionnaires were answered one after another), ii) the so called
crud factor, that is everything correlates to some degree with everything in the social sciences as pointed out by Meehl
[Meehl, 1990]. However, we have to acknowledge that these correlations are a limitation of this work and need to be
further tested in the future.
Lastly, the predictive validity analysis confirmed that our BPN-TU scale was able to predict participants’ Intention
to Use different technologies in studies 1 and 4. The scales can thus be used to derive practical implications of need
satisfaction in human-technology interaction studies.
Although we showed construct validity, convergent and discriminant validity, as well as predictive validity to some
degree, we have to discuss limitations of this work.
First, as mentioned before, we also found high correlations between constructs, which we would not have expected and
which can be considered problematic. However, since these can also be explained by other causes such as common
method bias or crud factor, the discriminant and convergent validity must be further tested in future studies. This
includes a replication of the correlative results reported in study 1, but should also include other constructs such as
personality constructs (e.g., neuroticism) or other technology-related constructs (e.g., affinity for technology).
Second, even though we tested the scale with four different technologies (chatbot, exoskeleton, voice assistant and care
robot) we highly encourage other researchers to use the BPN-TU scale in their studies with additional technologies
to provide further evidence for the model fit. This may include non-humanoid robots such as manufacturing robots,
different AI-based assistants, or augmented reality glasses.
Third, outcome variables other than the users’ intention to use a technology could be examined to test predictive validity.
For example, measures of users’ motivation to use the technology, as well as users’ well-being are important outcome
variables that should be considered in future studies. In addition, measures that assess the influence of BPN Satisfaction
on the duration and frequency of actual use in the field should be included in future research in the field.
Fourth, while we assumed construct validity by demonstrating good fit of the theoretical factor structure to the data,
validity needs also be quantified by demonstrating high correlations of different measures of the same construct. As
proposed by Schimmack [Schimmack, 2021], this requires three independent measures of the same construct in a
multi-method study. However, this is costly and difficult, especially in the case of BPN in context of human-technology
interaction as to date not many measures exist that can be used for such a rigorous test.

As Cronbach [Cronbach, 1971] notes, construct validation is an ever-extending and thus never-ending process. This
article describes a successful start of such a validation process, of which there are still far too few in the literature on
HCI [Leichtmann et al., 2022]. It is thus a first step towards achieving more reliable measurements and thus more robust
results in user studies. Nevertheless, the validity of the BPN-TU scale still needs to be considered and tested, which is
why we encourage researchers to consider this scale in the context of other constructs and technologies, as well as to
discuss it on a theoretical level.
5 Conclusion
The main goal of this paper was to develop and validate a scale to measure BPN Satisfaction for contexts of technology
use and interaction. As demonstrated, we were able to validate a scale that is applicable across different technologies
and contexts. This scale validation facilitates processes of replicability and comparability across studies and disciplines.
The scale can be applied in empirical research in the areas of HCI, Engineering Psychology, User Experience research
and related fields. Therefore, we encourage other researchers in the field of HCI to use this scale and include BPN
Satisfaction as a measure for users’ long-term well-being and as a predictor for their intention to use technologies.
