Abstract
The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on various aspects of life, including romantic
relationships, has already been demonstrated in several investigations. The aim of the present
study was to extend these findings by including a period extending from the beginning to the
near end of the pandemic (April 2020-March 2022) and applying a latent class approach to
identify population subgroups with different relationship and sexual satisfaction trajectories.
We identified three latent classes, a group with high satisfaction levels but a descending
trajectory, a group with low satisfaction levels but an ascending trajectory, and a fluctuating
group. Living apart, psychological symptoms, low life satisfaction, and avoidant attachment
characterized the latter two groups. Separations were mainly predicted by sex and living apart.
TRAJECTORIES OF RELATIONSHIP AND SEXUAL SATISFACTION
Introduction
From the moment the WHO first declared Covid-19 a global pandemic on March 11
2020 (World Health Organization, 2020), a large number of studies tried to investigate its
consequences on individuals and demonstrated effects on well-being, psychological symptoms
such as anxiety or stress, friendship networks, and the organization of everyday life (e.g.,
Bourmistrova et al., 2022; Dragano et al., 2022; Lippke et al., 2021; Talevi et al., 2020).
Similarly, a wide range of evidence is available on how the pandemic has affected couples and
families, such as their relationship quality, sexuality, couple daily adjustment, and partner
violence (see Estlein et al., 2022; for a review).
The main reason for these negative effects of the pandemic are the various stressors that
accompanied it. These include uncertainty about the future, concerns about one's own health
and that of loved ones, financial and work-related worries, for example due to closed
workplaces and short-time working, and social isolation, for example due to quarantine (e.g.,
Cindrich et al., 2021; Hertz-Palmor et al., 2021; Ornell et al., 2020; Taylor, 2022). According
to the stress-spillover theory, external stressors can lead to internal stress in couples through a
variety of mechanisms. Thus, exposing one or both partners to external stressors may result in
less time spent together, decreased mutual understanding and frequency of communication, and
more frequent occurrence of problematic personality traits such as rigidity, anxiety, or hostility
(e.g., Randall & Bodenmann, 2009).
The influence of stress is highlighted in the vulnerability-stress-adaptation model as well
(Karney & Bradbury, 1995), which further emphasizes that personal vulnerabilities and the
interaction between vulnerabilities and external stress can have a negative impact on
relationships. Examples of vulnerabilities in the context of relationships include insecure
attachment style, neuroticism, or psychological symptoms, as they can be associated with lower
satisfaction, lower relationship stability, and also relationship-endangering tendencies, such as
adverse communication styles (e.g., Hazan & Shaver, 1987; Karney & Bradbury, 1995;
TRAJECTORIES OF RELATIONSHIP AND SEXUAL SATISFACTION
O'Meara & South, 2019). The applicability of these theoretical approaches during the pandemic
has already been demonstrated by several studies. As a theoretical framework, Pietromonaco
and Overall (2020) and Karantzas et al. (2021) outlined how different Covid-related stressors
could affect couples and their dyadic coping. Empirically it was shown that the negative effect
of pandemic stress on romantic relationships might be moderated by attachment insecurity
(Overall et al., 2022; Vigl, Strauss, et al., 2022), psychological distress (Abira et al., 2020),
anxiety (Panzeri et al., 2020), dyadic coping (Randall et al., 2022), or living circumstances,
such as noncohabitating or living with children (Vigl, Talamini, et al., 2022).
Couples and families were particularly affected by the pandemic, mostly by changes in
daily routines and challenges regarding the balance between closeness and distance. For
example, cohabitating couples sometimes had to spend long periods of time together in a
confined space, in some cases working from home or caring for children (Feeney & Fitzgerald,
2021; Waismel-Manor et al., 2021). Noncohabitating couples, on the other hand, in some cases
could not meet for months because of mobility restrictions or because traveling abroad was
simply not allowed (Dewitte et al., 2020; Hale et al., 2021). Even though several digital
communication options are available nowadays, the enforced separation of couples over a
longer period of time represents a risk factor for their relationships (Haggerty et al., 2022),
which has been shown to be especially harmful for sexual satisfaction (Vigl, Strauss, et al.,
2022; Vigl, Talamini, et al., 2022). Thus, it appears that the pandemic has affected relationship
and sexual satisfaction differently, despite being moderately to strongly correlated according to
previous studies (Fallis et al., 2016).
When examining these dynamics, it is crucial to be mindful of the time frame under
consideration. For example, if there were short-term effects at the beginning of the pandemic,
it cannot be simply inferred that they would persist after one or two years. Thus, it is known
that positive or negative changes in happiness or well-being following significant events regress
over time to pre-event levels, which is also referred to as hedonic adaptation (e.g., Brickman et
TRAJECTORIES OF RELATIONSHIP AND SEXUAL SATISFACTION
al., 1978; Lykken & Tellegen, 1996). With respect to the Covid-19 pandemic, recent results
have shown that habituation can occur in the context of social restrictions (Reitsema et al.,
2022) and recovery from illness (Dahlen et al., 2022). Moreover, there is evidence suggesting
that the pandemic may have affected couples in different ways (Estlein et al., 2022). This aspect
is typically lost in approaches that focus on general or average trends, which may occlude the
presence of distinct or even opposing trajectories characterizing different types of individuals
(Collins & Lanza, 2009). Latent class analyses can be valuable in this context, as they identify
subgroups of change trajectories in the dataset, proportions of the sample that may be assigned
to the respective groups, and factors that determine group membership. Similar approaches to
studying the effects of the pandemic have been used to examine changes in psychological
distress, loneliness, depressiveness, and anxiety (Ahrens et al., 2021; Mayerl et al., 2022; Pierce
et al., 2021), but, to our knowledge, have not yet been used to examine relationship trajectories.
In summary, evidence regarding changes in relationship and sexual satisfaction to date
predominantly concerns the beginning to the first year of the pandemic and is mixed, showing
both negative and positive aspects and highlighting the impact of demographic, couple-level,
and individual factors (Estlein et al., 2022). With the present prospective longitudinal study,
these results will be extended by investigating changes in relationship and sexual satisfaction
over two years in the pandemic. By assigning individual trajectories to latent classes, we aim
understand what proportion of the sample exhibited certain trajectories and what different
shapes of change existed. In addition, we would like to explore predictors of class memberships,
including demographic, relationship-related and personality factors measured at the first
measurement point.
Method
Participants
Data were collected in the course of a longitudinal study with six measurement time
points (Vigl, Strauss, et al., 2022; Vigl, Talamini, et al., 2022). A total of 2,582 individuals
TRAJECTORIES OF RELATIONSHIP AND SEXUAL SATISFACTION
participated in the first measurement point of study and gave their consent to be contacted again
at further measurement occasions (74.9% female, 0.5% non-binary), the average age being
31.11 (SD = 11.38) years. Most individuals reported being in a heterosexual relationship
(93.8%), while some participants indicated a homosexual (5.5%) or non-binary (0.7%
relationship), with an average relationship duration of 6.39 (SD = 8.01) years. Slightly more
than half of the participants (58.2%) was cohabitating with their partners and 19.6% had
children. Individuals from 67 different countries participated in the study, with most of them
living in Italy (34.6%), GSA-region (25.6%), United States (21.5%) and United Kingdom
(8.6%). Detailed information on a wide variety of sample characteristics, differences between
cohabitating and noncohabitating individuals, and predictors of relationship and sexual
satisfaction in the first six months and the first year of the pandemic can be found in our
previous publications (Vigl, Strauss, et al., 2022; Vigl, Talamini, et al., 2022).
Measures
The survey was provided in English, German, and Italian. If no translation of the scales
used were available for some language, three fluent independent translators provided their
translations of the items and decided together on the best versions.
Outcomes:
Relationship and Sexual Satisfaction. We assessed relationship satisfaction with the
Relationship Assessment Scale (Hendrick, 1988) and its German version (Hassebrauck, 1991).
It consists of seven items (range  = .90–.92). Sexual satisfaction was measured with an one-
item measure (Mark et al., 2014). Both measures were answered on a 5-point scale with higher
values indicating higher satisfaction. Satisfaction levels were measured at every time point. We
further assessed relationship and sexual satisfaction before the pandemic retrospectively with
the same measures at the first measurement point, due to the lack of real-time data before the
outbreak of Covid-19.

Predictors of Latent Class Memberships:
Insecure Attachment. Attachment anxiety and avoidance were measured with a short
form of the Experiences in Close Relationships questionnaire (Lafontaine et al., 2016) and the
German (Brenk-Franz et al., 2018) and Italian (Busonera et al., 2014) translations of items. The
scale is composed of eight items that are answered on a 5-point scale ( = .84 for attachment
anxiety,  = .71 for attachment avoidance).
Psychological Symptoms. We administered a short form of the Depression Anxiety
Stress Scale and its German and Italian versions (Bottesi et al., 2015; Nilges & Essau, 2015;
Yusoff, 2013). This scale consists of nine items answered on a 4-point scale, of which we
computed a mean score ( = .86).
Negative emotionality. Three items of the extra-short form of the Big Five Inventory
and its German translations (Rammstedt et al., 2020; Soto & John, 2017), answered on a 5-
point scale, were administered to assess negative emotionality ( = .74).
Pandemic-related worries. We created a scale of six items that investigated worries
about the spread of the virus, one’s own health and the health of loved ones, work-related and
financial worries, and concerns about personal relationships (family relationships and
friendships). Answers were given on a 10-point scale (1 = not worried at all, 10 = very worried)
and an average score of overall worries was calculated ( = .75).
Demographic characteristics. We assessed gender, age (in years), highest educational
level, relationship duration (in years), if participants were cohabitating with their partner (0 =
no, 1 = yes), and whether they had children. Furthermore we assessed the size of the living area
(1 = semi-rural or rural, 2 = small-to-medium city, 3 = big city) and if the occupational situation
of the participant changed because of the pandemic (-1 = I work less hours/lost my job, 0 = no
changes, 1 = I work more hours/got a new job).

Procedure
We conducted the study online using LimeSurvey software and recruited participants
through personal contacts, the university mailing list, newspapers, flyers and posts on social
networks, the website SurveyCircle and the crowdsourcing service Clickworker, where
participants were compensated with €12 (~12 USD) for participating in all time points.
Participation was open to all adults in any form of romantic relationship and the study was
published online on April 8, 2020. The first three surveys took place approximately 10 days
apart, while the other measurement points were half a year or a year apart. In order to facilitate
grouping participants into trajectories of satisfaction with more equally spaced measurement
points, only four assessments are reported in this analysis: T1 in April 2020 (n = 3262), T2 in
November 2020 (n = 1378), T3 in March 2021 (n = 1019, and T4 in March 2022 (n = 996). The
Ethics Committee of the Institute of Psychology, University of Innsbruck, approved the study
and subjects gave their informed consent to participate.
Missing Data
We dealt with missing values as described in detail in Vigl, Talamini, et al. (2022).
Little’s (1988) MCAR-test indicated that our data was not missing completely at random,
χ (7535) = 26,997, p < .001. As we observed associations between assessed characteristics and
introduce bias to our analysis, we considered our data missing at random (Rubin, 1976) and
handled missing values in dependent and independent variables with controlled multiple
imputation with the mice package in R (van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011). In
estimating missing values by a matrix of related variables in the dataset, we created 10 multiply
imputed data sets and averaged the results according to Rubin's rules (Rubin, 2004). As 266
individuals reported a separation in the course of the longitudinal study, their relationship and
sexual satisfaction scores were set to the lowest value (1) from the time of separation to avoid
imputing unrealistically high scores.
TRAJECTORIES OF RELATIONSHIP AND SEXUAL SATISFACTION
Data Analysis
To identify latent subgroups of trajectories of relationship and sexual satisfaction during
two years in the pandemic, we performed latent class mixed models using the LCMM package
in R (Proust-Lima et al., 2022), which has been shown to be very valid compared to other
longitudinal cluster analysis methods (Verboon et al., 2022). This analytical strategy belongs
to the group of parametric finite mixture models that allow for heterogeneity within subgroups
and assumes that the population consists of a finite number of latent classes, where each class
can be characterized by a specific trajectory (in this case of relationship and sexual satisfaction)
over time (Nguefack et al., 2020). We estimated models with random intercept and slope per
class and tested models from one to four clusters with linear, quadratic and cubic trajectories,
with the one-class solution used to obtain start values for the other models. We added the classes
stepwise and compared model fit based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), the entropy
statistic, the sample size of the classes, and the average of the maximum posterior probability
of assignments (APPA). We selected models with the lowest BICs, an entropy statistic > 0.50,
which implies a sufficient separation of the latent classes, a sample size > 5% of the sample,
and an APPA value > 70% for all classes (Lennon et al., 2018). To model the latent classes,
we only included individuals who did not report a separation during the course of the study.
After the latent classes were identified and each participant was assigned to a class according
to the greatest posterior probability of class membership, we analyzed predictors of latent class
memberships using binary logistic regressions. As predictors, we entered the demographic,
relationship-related and personality-related characteristics we assessed at the first measurement
point. Finally, with another binary logistic regression, we predicted separations by the same
baseline characteristics.
Because we are aware of the different challenges faced by cohabitants and noncohabitants, we
supplemental material, the trajectories of the two groups were broadly similar, so we decided
to run the models for the entire sample.

Results
Relationship and Sexual Satisfaction Trajectories
As described in the Data Analysis section, we started each latent class model (one for
relationship satisfaction and one for sexual satisfaction) with a 1-class solution, then gradually
added more classes, and finally compared the different models based on model characteristics
satisfaction trajectories and the proportion of the sample assigned to the different classes.
with those of sexual satisfaction appearing somewhat more pronounced. In terms of relationship
satisfaction, 83% of the sample was assigned to the high descending trajectory, in which
satisfaction slightly declined over time. A smaller group of individuals belonged to the low
ascending class (9%), where relationship satisfaction was low at the beginning of the study,
then slightly increased and declined again. The smallest group (8%) of the sample was classified
as high fluctuating, meaning that the level of satisfaction changed considerably at the beginning
of the pandemic, recovered somewhat and remained at a medium level in the other measurement
time points.
The classification of the trajectories of sexual satisfaction was similar, but the group
sizes differed from those of relationship satisfaction: We allocated 59% of participants to the
high descending class, almost a quarter (24%) to the high fluctuating class, and 17% to the low
ascending class.
2 Unevenly sized groups are not uncommon in latent class analyses, although one criterion for
class selection is that groups should include at least 5% of the sample, which corresponds to at
least 129 individuals in our case (Hagenaars & McCutcheon, 2002).

measures.

Predictors of Latent Classes
To identify predictors of class memberships, we analyzed the data with six binary
logistic regressions, predicting the three classes of relationship satisfaction and the three classes
of sexual satisfaction. As with a large sample size it is possible to obtain significant results with
negligible effect sizes, we will only discuss predictors that have at least a small effect size (odds
ratio ≥ 1.5 or the inverse value of odds ratio ≤ 0.67) according to Rosenthal (1996). These
effects are highlighted in bold in the Tables 2 and 3.
belonging to the low ascending class where higher for individuals with children, avoidant
attachment and low life satisfaction. The probability of being assigned to the high fluctuating
class was higher among noncohabitating individuals and those with psychological symptoms.
Assignment to the high descending class went along with cohabitating, life satisfaction, secure
attachment, absence of psychological symptoms and a not having children.

predictors: gender (odds ratio = 2.32 [1.93; 2.72*]) and cohabitation status (odds ratio = 0.46

Discussion
The present study aimed to model trajectories of relationship and sexual satisfaction
across two years in the pandemic with latent class analysis and to identify predictors of class
membership and separations. We addressed our research questions with a cross-national sample
and over 2000 individuals, of which approximately half cohabitated with their partners and 20%
had children.
Trajectories of Relationship and Sexual Satisfaction
We identified three different trajectories for both relationship and sexual satisfaction in
our sample, representing a high descending, high fluctuating, and low ascending class,
respectively. Individuals in the high descending class started with high satisfaction scores, but
their satisfaction declined over the course of the study. Those in the high fluctuating class, on
the other hand, showed marked declines in satisfaction at the beginning of the pandemic (April
2020), from which they recovered somewhat, though not completely, and satisfaction continued
to fall in the following measurement periods. Individuals in the low ascending class, on the
other hand, started with low satisfaction levels, which stayed quite stable with a slight increase
(relationship satisfaction), or increased at the beginning of the pandemic (until November 2020)
and then remained quite stable (sexual satisfaction). Although the class names suggest similar
trajectories at first glance, our results indicate that relationship and sexual satisfaction do not
necessarily go hand in hand and may not always follow the same trajectories.
Overall, relationship satisfaction exhibited higher resilience to pandemic-related
influences than did sexual satisfaction: Thus, 83% of the sample followed a high descending
trajectory, while only 8% were assigned to the high fluctuating trajectory. Nine percent of the
sample started with low relationship satisfaction, which improved slightly over time.
Conversely, sexual satisfaction tended to be less stable, with major fluctuations across the
TRAJECTORIES OF RELATIONSHIP AND SEXUAL SATISFACTION
changes in sexual satisfaction seemed to be more pronounced than in relationship satisfaction.
The decrease in satisfaction in the high descending class of sexual satisfaction was stronger
than those of relationship satisfaction, the fluctuations in the high fluctuating class at the
beginning of the pandemic were larger for sexual satisfaction, and so was the increase in
satisfaction in the low ascending class. These patterns are consistent with a trend that we already
observed in the analyses of our data after one year of the pandemic. There, we found lower
values of sexual than relationship satisfaction and more fluctuating sexual satisfaction,
especially among noncohabiting individuals (Vigl, Talamini, et al., 2022).
The greater instability of sexual satisfaction relative to overall relationship satisfaction
may be related to the fact that physical closeness was more affected by Covid-related measures
than other relationship aspects. For example, cohabiting couples in an Italian study reported
decreased sexual activity due to lack of privacy (triggered by national quarantine) (Cito et al.,
2021), whereas noncohabiting couples were unable to act out their sexuality due to lack of
contact (Vigl, Strauss, et al., 2022). The finding that both satisfaction measures in high
fluctuating classes declined the most at the beginning of the pandemic is consistent with the
findings of other studies that observed declines in satisfaction in the first weeks of the pandemic
(e.g., Ahuja & Khurana, 2021; Overall et al., 2022). In addition, this trend follows the change
in Covid-related measures, which were much stronger in April 2020 than at other measurement
points in time (Hale et al., 2021). It should be emphasized that although these initial declines
in satisfaction recovered somewhat in the high fluctuating classes, they did not return to the
retrospectively reported pre-pandemic levels.
More unexpected than the declines in satisfaction at the beginning of the pandemic
among (high fluctuating classes) was that even among individuals who started with high
relationship and sexual satisfaction (and represented the majority of the sample), satisfaction
3 In our sample, the stringency index (Hale et al., 2021), which can take a value between 0 and 100, was 81.4 at
the first measurement time point, whereas it was 69.1, 74.3, and 30.7 at T2, T3, and T4, respectively.
TRAJECTORIES OF RELATIONSHIP AND SEXUAL SATISFACTION
declined over time (high descending classes). This trend was again more pronounced with
respect to sexual satisfaction, but indicates that, at least up to two years of pandemic, rebound
from negative pandemic effects had not fully occurred. This may be explained by the fact that
the pandemic was not over in March 2022, and pandemic-related stressors had not waned for
most couples. However, March 2022 also saw the beginning of the Russian-Ukrainian war,
another crisis with global ramifications that may have generated stress and worry independently
of the pandemic (Barchielli et al., 2022; Riad et al., 2022), which in turn may have triggered
stress-spillover effects on relationships (Randall & Bodenmann, 2009).
A small group of participants, however, started with very low satisfaction, which then
increased (low ascending). This increase was quite weak for relationship satisfaction in this
group, but was more pronounced for sexual satisfaction, especially between April and
November 2020. Despite remaining the group with the lowest satisfaction levels of the three
groups throughout the pandemic, the improvements are nonetheless noteworthy, because one
might have expected that a poor relationship would be particularly vulnerable to major stressor
and have deteriorated further as a consequence. Though unexpected, this finding is consistent
with positive changes following the early stages of the pandemic reported in other studies,
where it was explained by an increase in opportunities for intimacy among cohabitating couples
(Li et al., 2020), or due to incorporating new sexual activities, such as sexting or sharing sexual
fantasies among noncohabitating couples (Lehmiller et al., 2021).
Predictors of Class Memberships and Separations
Membership in high fluctuating classes, i.e., those trajectories that seemed to be most
affected by the pandemic, was mainly predicted by cohabitating status and psychological
symptoms, indicating that noncohabitants and those with symptoms were more likely to be
assigned to this class. The distinct difficulties of noncohabiting couples have already been
highlighted in our previous publications (Vigl, Strauss, et al., 2022; Vigl, Talamini, et al., 2022)

and probably correspond to the restricted physical contact possibilities (Dewitte et al., 2020),
the difficulty of replacing certain aspects of the relationship (e.g., sexuality) with digital
communication (Neustaedter & Greenberg, 2012), and also the uncertainties about when
normal relationship formation would be possible again. We might also speculate that the
challenges at the beginning of the pandemic led to partners distancing themselves from each
other and losing some trust and relationship security (Dainton & Aylor, 2001), which was not
fully restored even when restrictions were eased. Having found noncohabitation as a predictor
of separations would argue in favor of this theory. Regarding psychological symptomatology,
previous studies have indicated that, for example, partners' depressive symptoms may predict
relationship deterioration following an impactful event such as the birth of a child (e.g., Cox et
al., 1999; Whisman et al., 2011). Similarly, Karantzas et al. (2021) postulated that psychological
symptoms may exacerbate the negative effects of the pandemic on couples by impairing the
ability of perspective-taking and the perception of support offered from the partner.
The other predictors identified were largely consistent with our assumptions based on
the vulnerability-stress-adaptation model (Karney & Bradbury, 1995): Thus, attachment
avoidance and low life satisfaction were associated with higher probabilities for low ascending
classes and lower probabilities for high descending classes. When considering significant, albeit
very small, effect sizes, attachment avoidance and anxiety also emerged as predictors of highly
fluctuating relationship satisfaction as did pandemic-related worries as predictors of fluctuating
sexual satisfaction. These findings again suggest the applicability of the vulnerability stress
adaptation model during the pandemic period (Karantzas et al., 2021; Karney & Bradbury,
1995; Pietromonaco & Overall, 2020). Individuals with children were more likely to belong to
the low ascending class, consistent with the finding that couples with children tangentially have
slightly lower satisfaction scores than those without children (Twenge et al., 2003), what was
also found in other studies during the pandemic (e.g., Schmid et al., 2020; Vigl, Talamini, et
al., 2022).

With regard to separations, we were able to identify only two predictors: Women and
noncohabiting individuals were more likely to separate. The higher frequency of separations
among noncohabitants again highlights that the pandemic might have had a stronger negative
impact on this group. In the case of future pandemics, it might be possible to use this knowledge
in designing social distancing policies, for example by according certain exemptions to couples
living apart. It is also important to recognize that a lack of closeness to the partner, whether
emotional or physical, might not only affect relationship satisfaction, but also the well-being of
both partners (Pusch et al., 2022). The finding that women were more likely to report separation
could be due to women being more likely to initiate separations (e.g. Charvoz et al., 2008;
Rosenfeld, 2018; Sweeney, 2002). This tendency would place men more often on the receiving
end of their partners’ separation decisions, potentially resulting in less frequent reports of
separations among men, because they may have considered the separations to be temporary or
because they were reluctant to admit to themselves and to others that a breakup had in fact
occurred. In evaluating these interpretations, it is important to keep in mind that we were not
able to verify if all, or even a majority of separated individuals, reported their breakups, which
may also have led to missing other important predictors of separations.
Strengths and Limitations
The study’s main strengths are its large, cross-national sample, which included
approximately equal numbers of cohabiting and noncohabiting individuals, and its duration,
which in effect almost covered the entire period of the pandemic. By adopting a latent class
approach to changes in relationship and sexual satisfaction, we were able to identify population
subgroups with distinct satisfaction trajectories as well as vulnerability and resiliency factors
consistent with vulnerability-stress-adaptation model (Karney & Bradbury, 1995).
Limitations include the high proportion of women in our sample (>70%), the relatively
high level of education compared to the populations reference values (see Vigl, Strauss, et al.,
TRAJECTORIES OF RELATIONSHIP AND SEXUAL SATISFACTION
2022), and the inclusion of individuals instead of couples. Another limitation is that relationship
and sexual satisfaction before the pandemic had to be assessed retrospectively. This limitation
is somewhat mitigated by the finding that retrospective ratings of relationship satisfaction tend
to be either accurate or negatively biased, while our data showed satisfaction levels that were
above population reference values (Karney & Frye, 2002; Zygar-Hoffmann & Schönbrodt,
2020). Although there is reason to believe that our retrospective assessments were relatively
accurate (see Vigl, Strauss, et al., 2022), they are not a replacement for a prospective
assessment. A further general problem with longitudinal studies is possible regression to the
mean (Barnett, 2004), which could help explaining the tendency for sexual and relationship
satisfaction to decrease among initially satisfied and to increase among initially dissatisfied
individuals. On the other hand, our design lacked some features that tend to lead to a stronger
regression to the mean, namely a selection of the sample based on extreme groups, unreliable
scales, or a focus on changes in dichotomous states (Zhang & Tomblin, 2003).
Conclusion
Taken together, our study shows that in general the short-term impact of the pandemic
observed in other studies still persisted two years after its onset. At the same time, we were able
to identify subgroups that differed in their trajectories of relationship and sexual satisfaction
during the pandemic and that were characterized by individual dispositions and vulnerabilities.
Our findings also revealed that general relationship and sexual satisfaction did not always
follow parallel paths. Apart from adding to our understanding of the dynamics of relationship
functioning in response to the considerable stresses and disruptions to daily life caused by the
pandemic, we hope that this understanding can be helpful in informing responses and policies
to future pandemics or disruptive events of a similar nature.
