The use of art exhibitions to mediate people s attitudes toward societal challenges climate change, refugees;
general prosocialness is an emerging interest for institutions, artists, policy, and, recently, for empirical study.
However, there is still much need for data regarding whether, and in which ways, we might detect attitude change.

baseline. The pre post paradigm detected some reduction in self-assessed xenophobia and increased nega-
