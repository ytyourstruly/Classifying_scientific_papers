Abstract
Artwork, ubiquitous across all human cultures, offers an innovative medium for
studying human memory. This review article discusses the value of various art forms
in exploring human memory and its neural mechanisms. We summarize novel
experimental paradigms and computational methodologies used to investigate the
storage and reconstruction of artworks. The development of naturalistic neuroimaging
and advanced statistical frameworks are highlighted as key advancements in our
understanding of memory encoding of artworks. We propose investigating the neural
mechanisms underpinning memory consolidation, or neural replay, through the lens of
artwork. We theorize that the mnemonic benefits of artwork may arise from enhanced
memory consolidation during wakeful rest or sleep. The memory replay of artworks
may embody more than reactivation of identical information, extending to
personalized memory reconstruction. To quantify memory reconstruction at both
behavioral and neural levels, drawing and memory-based creative writing are
proposed as retrieval tests. We advocate the use of Deep Neural Networks to assess
the similarities of behaviors and neural responses between encoding and retrieval. In
conclusion, studying human memory with artworks offers valuable insights into the
complex interplay between memory and other cognitive, affective, and social
processes, with far-reaching implications for art, journalism, and communication.

General Audience Summary
Have you ever contemplated the mechanisms behind your brain's ability to recall a
stunning painting witnessed in a gallery, or the captivating tune of a novel song? In
the quest to decipher this enigma, researchers have employed cutting-edge
neuroimaging technologies and advanced mathematical models to investigate the
processes underlying the encoding and retrieval of artistic experiences within our
neural circuits.
We postulate that the cognitive strategies deployed for encoding, consolidating, and
recollecting art significantly diverge from those associated with ordinary real-life
memory experiences. It appears that each act of recollection may be imbued with a
unique, subjective imprint, analogous to digitally enhancing an image or
reconfiguring a musical piece within the confines of our minds. To further probe these
hypotheses, forthcoming research could involve participants recreating or drawling
the observed artwork, thereby providing empirical data for memory assessment.
Additionally, intricate computational simulations, mirroring cerebral functions, may
be utilized to gauge the fidelity of recollected experiences against their original
occurrences.
Delving into the intricacies of how we remember art not only expands our
understanding of memory's intricate weave but also illuminates its intricate
connections with our emotions, communicative capacities, and social intercourse.
1. Introduction
Memory remains a central topic of neuroscience and psychology due to its critical
importance in both educational contexts and the acquisition of skills. Hermann
Ebbinghaus, widely recognized as the pioneer of memory research, conducted self-
experiments involving the memorization of nonsensical three-letter syllables1. While
these syllables provided rigorous experimental control, their ecological validity (EV)
might be questioned. Specifically, their capacity to explore essential determinants of
human memory, such prior knowledge and novelty2, emotional influence3, and temporal
sequence4,5, remain limited. Subsequent Ebbinghaus' pioneering work, memory
researchers have diversified their employment of materials for memory research,
encompassing vocabularies6,7, images of objects and/or scenes8, human faces9,10, and
intricate conceptual or scientific information11.
The study of human memory is complicated by the lack of direct behavioral
measures during the encoding phase regardless of employed materials. Our primary
means of determining successful memory encoding has traditionally been through
assessing performance during retrieval. However, with the emergence of noninvasive
brain imaging techniques, we now have a potential solution. We can investigate whether
successful memory formation is associated with brain activities observed during the
encoding process. Nearly 25 years ago, this possibility was simultaneously investigated
by two research groups employing the subsequent memory paradigm and functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Brewer and colleagues utilized color images of
scenes8, while Wagner et al. employed visually presented English words7 as encoding
material for studying memory formation in the brain via fMRI. Despite differing
encoding materials, both groups determined that the ability to recall stimuli in
subsequent retrieval tasks correlated with activation in the prefrontal cortex and
hippocampus during encoding, a phenomenon known as the subsequent memory effect
(SME). Using invasive brain recordings in treatment-resistant epilepsy patients,
Fernández et al. demonstrated that successful memory retrieval of German words could
be predicted by hippocampal neural activity roughly 500 milliseconds post-stimulus
presentation6. Over the past two decades, studies have employed diverse brain
recording techniques, memory tests, and encoding materials, comparing brain activities
during the encoding of subsequently remembered and forgotten information12. Findings
from these SME studies have spurred memory researchers to localize the core brain
networks for memory13,14. Generally, human memory is believed to involve three major
subsystems: (1) the medial temporal lobe (MTL) system, inclusive of the hippocampus,
parahippocampal cortex, and entorhinal cortex; (2) the prefrontal system, involving the
inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and medial prefrontal cortex; and (3) the parietal system,
which includes the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), precuneus, and angular gyrus (AG)).
Subsequent studies have demonstrated that these brain networks are not only active
during encoding but are also heavily involved in memory retrieval15,16.
However, recent advancements of our understanding of human memory have
primarily been driven by progress in brain imaging acquisition and analysis, often
neglecting the differential contributions of various materials to memory research. In
this perspective article, we advocate for the use of artworks as a medium to study human
memory and its related neural mechanisms. The recent advancements in naturalistic
neuroimaging necessitate a reassessment of the importance of specific materials in
cognitive neuroscience. With this in mind, we particularly emphasize the potential of
artworks - a unique form of naturalistic stimuli - to enhance our understanding of the
human memory system. We argue that artworks not only aid in identifying the SME
stimuli, into human memory. Nonetheless, to harness the full potential of artworks, the
subsequent memory paradigm alone is insufficient. Thus, we further outline innovative
experimental paradigms and computational methods for studying art memories,
emphasizing their ability to elucidate the individualized memory reconstruction
process, spanning from encoding to consolidation and retrieval. Lastly, we advocate for
interdisciplinary collaboration among psychologists, neuroscientists, computer
scientists, and most notably, artists. Such collaboration could illuminate the
fundamental principles governing how artists communicate and resonate with
audiences.
memory studies to identify subsequent memory effects in the human brain.
(1) Traditional vs Art Materials: Traditional materials used in memory studies
include stimuli such as Chinese characters, English vocabulary, images, and human
faces. In comparison, naturalistic neuroimaging studies have utilized artworks,
including paintings, films, music, and novels to study memory formation. (2)
Perception Phase: During this stage, participants are presented with materials and
instructed to remember them. Neural activity associated with encoding is recorded
using neuroimaging tools such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or
electroencephalography (EEG). (3) Retrieval Phase: Following the perception stage,
participants attempt to recall the materials they were asked to remember. Based on
memory performance, neural activity during the perception phase is categorized
within specific time windows as either "Remember" (successful recall) or "Forget"
(unsuccessful recall). (4) Identifying Neural Networks for Successful Encoding: By
contrasting the "Remember" and "Forget" conditions, previous studies have identified
the brain networks implicated in successful memory encoding.
2. What can artworks contribute to study of human memory?
Before we delve into the study of human memories through the lens of artworks, it is
imperative to clearly define the term “artwork”. Although art is a sprawling and diverse
field, for the purpose of this discussion, we have confined the definition of artworks to
paintings, sculptures, music compositions, movies, novels, and poetry that have gained
considerable popularity. However, modern forms of art such as movies, video games,
and photographs, while undoubtedly falling under the umbrella of art, possess
distinctive characteristics that set them apart from traditional art forms and thus
necessitate case-by-case consideration. Not every piece of video content should be
considered a movie. While some recordings may qualify as movies, others are merely
captures of everyday life, lacking the deliberate artistry often associated with film. The
distinction between the two does not hinge on duration; rather, it lies in the presence of
artistic elements and storytelling. A true movie is marked by its aesthetic appeal, which
includes visual artistry, thematic depth, and emotional resonance. Furthermore, it
possesses a comprehensive narrative structure that guides the audience through a
thoughtfully constructed plot, with well-developed characters and a meaningful arc.
These are the hallmarks that set films apart from simple video recordings of daily events.
Similarly, not all captured images can be rightfully termed as photographs; a
distinction must be made between those that rise to the level of photographic art and
those that are mere snapshots of moments in time. The differentiation does not lie in the
subject matter or the complexity of the image, but in the aesthetic qualities and the
intent behind the image. A true photograph is characterized by its artistic expression
and the photographer's vision, which is evident in the composition, lighting, perspective,
and emotional impact. Moreover, a photograph often conveys a narrative or concept,
inviting the viewer to engage with the scene in a meaningful way. These elements
combine to elevate a photograph beyond a simple picture, transforming it into a work
that captures not just a moment, but a piece of human experience. Video games have
been predominantly used in human cognitive neuroscience to study action control,
spatial navigation, and for cognitive training 17. Given that the player determines the
specific content of a video game, and the content fluctuates significantly between
participants, video games are uniquely suited for the study of specific memory types
(e.g., autobiographical memory or action memory). Concurrently, for the purposes of
this article, we have a specific definition for music that excludes music or sound
containing spoken words, given the existence of separate neural pathways for
processing music and speech18–20.
While artworks hold a shared value in studying human memory, it is essential to
consider their inherent characteristics when developing corresponding studies. We
suggest dividing the various types of art into two categories: static and dynamic art
presence of temporal regularities (e.g., sequence and/or rhythm) in the creation and
appreciation of the artwork. Hence, static and dynamic arts are best examined using
distinct methodologies. For more details on diverse research methodologies for static
and dynamic art, refer to the “Innovative Methods to Study Art Memories” section below.
Table1 Comparison between non-art and two major categories of artworks
Non-art daily-life stimuli Artworks
Static art Dynamic art
Examples Daily-life photos, Painting, Music,
Videos, Conversation Sculpture Poetry
Emotion Simple Complex Complex
Aesthetic processes Limited High High
Individual preferences Similar Varies Varies
Public evaluations Limited Extensive Extensive
Reconstruction Limited Intense Intense
Order/Rhythm Depends No Yes
Then, the critical question is: what unique contributions can artworks provide, as
opposed to other naturistic stimuli, in studying human memory? When contrasted
with stimuli such as nonsense syllables, vocabularies, or human faces, artworks offer a
distinct advantage in memory experiments due to their high Ecological Validity (EV).
High EV can enrich the real-life implications of research and increase participants’
engagement during experiments. This aspect is notably vital for brain imaging studies
involving populations beyond healthy college students, such as children 21, older adults
22, and patients with psychiatric disorders 23.
Some may argue that naturalistic stimuli, in general, already offer the benefits of high
EV 24–26. Here, we are making a deliberate comparison between non-artistic naturalistic
stimuli (e.g., daily-life photos, videos, conversation) and artworks (See Table1). We
propose four unique contributions of artworks in studying human memory system
extending beyond high EV and put forth corresponding testable hypotheses at the
behavioral and/or neural level (Figure2). In essence, we argue that, compared to non-
artistic naturalistic stimuli, artworks (1) are capable of eliciting heightened emotional
and aesthetic responses, (2) display more variance in individual preferences, (3) can be
quantified using large-scale public evaluations, and (4) may undergo individualized
memory reconstruction. We further emphasize that while other salient stimulus may
elicit emotional responses, only artworks can selectively invoke aesthetic processes
while concurrently satisfying all three additional predictions. The primary distinction
between artworks and other salient stimuli lies in the interaction of mnemonic
processing of artwork with the autobiographical memory system, which in turn triggers
greater individual variability in preferences and memory reconstructions.
(1) Compared to other naturalistic stimuli, the mnemonic processes of artworks could
evoke more intricate emotional reactions and dynamical interactions with the aesthetic
processes. Thus, when individuals intentionally remembering/recalling artworks, we
anticipate observing the triple network interactions among between brain regions
related to memory, emotion, and aesthetics. This could be evidenced by comparing
fMRI-based brain activities during encoding/recalling of artworks and other
(naturalistic) stimuli. However, we note that the emotional responses during mnemonic
processes of artworks may be too intricate and not potent enough to elicit conspicuous
biological responses (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, or pupil size). Concurrently, self-
reported emotional or reward ratings could vary significantly among individuals and
may largely rely on their language abilities. Therefore, we propose facial-expression
tracking as a non-neural objective measure of triple network interactions (See
“Innovative Methods to Study Art Memories” below). By simultaneously measuring the
dynamic fluctuations in brain activities and facial expressions, the proposed triple
network interaction model could be further validated.
(2) Artworks are likely to evoke more diverse personal preferences compared to non-
artistic naturalistic stimuli. In fact, a study explicitly comparing aesthetic preferences
for photographs of natural objects or landscapes to those for similar-themed paintings,
found that individual differences in aesthetic judgement were greater for the paintings
than photographs27. Correspondingly, we predict that artworks will induce more varied
neural responses patterns when shared brain responses when measured using the inter-
subject correlation (ISC) analysis28. Furthermore, this variance in individual responses
should be less pronounced in early sensory regions and more significant in high-order
regions related to emotional and conceptual understanding.
(3) Artworks provide a distinctive conduit, connecting laboratory-based memory
studies with public perceptions of identical artworks in real societal contexts.
Specifically, both objective and subjective evaluations of particular artworks are readily
available from hundreds of thousands of individuals. For example, the popularity of a
musical piece can be quantified by the number of downloads or plays, the “value” of a
painting can be, at least partly, determined by its auction price, and the success of a
movie can be gauged by online ratings (e.g., Internet Movie Database (IMDb)) from
thousands of viewers29,30. Thus, we posit that population-level opinions of artworks
could mirrored in neural responses and the memory performance of participants in
laboratory studies. We further hypothesize that while public perceptions are likely to
correlate strongly with diverse behavioral ratings in laboratories, public perceptions,
when compared to opinions from a limited number of individuals in such settings,
would serve as more accurate predictors of neural responses within culturally similar
groups.
(4) Artworks provide a unique platform to investigate the individualized memory
reconstruction in its entirety, encompassing encoding, consolidation, and retrieval.
Recent theoretical and empirical studies have underscored the abstraction, integration,
differentiation, and reorganization of memory representations31. We postulate that while
memory reconstruction is discernible in conventional formats of episodic memories,
such as pictures, this process may be more individualized when examining art-related
memories. This individualization can be attributed to the dynamic interplay between
new, incoming information, specifically artworks, and pre-existing autobiographical
memories, predominantly during the memory consolidation phase. For instance, the
capacity of music to evoke autobiographical memories is well documented (i.e., music-
evoked autobiographical memory32). We surmise that this capacity, albeit less described
in other art forms, could be generalizable to other formats of art. Upon encountering an
artwork, individuals are likely to activate primary nodes of autobiographical memories,
primarily life events. This activation leads to a unique, personal interpretation and
subsequent mental representation of artworks. Moreover, beyond the widely discussed
transformation from encoding to retrieval, individualized memory transformation of
artworks could occur more significantly during consolidation. Artworks frequently
elicit strong emotional responses, which can enhance memory consolidation. This
suggests a favorable window for older and newer memories to further interact with each
other. To encapsulate the individualized transformative process, it is essential to
measure neural similarities across diverse stages of memory (e.g., encoding-retrieval
similarity) amongst different individuals, and separately for artworks and non-art
naturalistic stimuli. We propose that while the essential elements of memory
representations remained intact during the transition from encoding and retrieval (i.e.,
pattern reinstatement33–35), neural representations of artworks undergo more substantial
changes than those of non-artwork stimuli. To support this proposed individualized
transformation, we need to compute the encoding-retrieval similarity for each
participant and between-participants similarity separately during encoding and retrieval.
If the neural representations of art memories are indeed modified in an individualized
manner, we anticipate observing two phenomena: firstly, between-participants
similarity during encoding should be higher than that during retrieval; secondly,
encoding-retrieval similarity should be higher than between-participants similarity
during retrieval.
Figure2 Unique contributions of artworks in studying human memory. (A) The triple
network interaction model of art memories. We summarize the key cognitive processes and
corresponding neural networks involved in art memories. We used Neurosynth
analyses using following terms: autobiographical memory, emotional response, and rewarding.
Our searches yielded 84, 97, and 120 relevant studies respectively. We propose that artworks
elicit complex emotional responses and foster dynamical interactions with aesthetic processes
during memory processing. (B) Individual preferences for artworks and associated neural
effects. Diverse preferences for artworks lead to different participants remembering different
sets of stimuli. Inter-subject correlations (ISC) between participants (e.g., between P1 and P2)
can be used to measure these individual preferences at the neural level. The ISC can be assessed
during memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. (C) Artworks as a link between public
opinions and laboratory findings. Objective measures for artworks, such as popularity and/or
prices, along with subjective liking ratings from the general population, can be correlated with
memory performance and/or neural measures in a laboratory setting. (D) Artworks as a
window into the individualized memory construction. By comparing memory
representations across different stages of memory, we predict that neural representations for
artworks should transform in a highly individual-specific manner. This comparison requires
repeated recording of brain responses from the same individual across different memory stages.
3. Innovative experimental paradigms and computational methods to study art
memories
Given the inherent properties of artworks and the unique cognitive processes proposed
to occur during their encoding, consolidation, and retrieval, we argue that innovative
experimental paradigms and computational methods should be integrated to study art
memories. We review promising experimental and computational methods in the order
art memories. During memory encoding (left), naturalistic neuroimaging approaches
can be employed to record brain responses to artworks. Concurrently, facial expression
tracking provides an innovative and objective method for measuring dynamic changes
in individuals’ emotional responses. Computational methods, including Deep Neural
Networks (DNN), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Vision (CV), are
utilized to extract unobservable features from artworks. These features can
subsequently be used to predict memory performance and mnemonic neural activity.
During memory consolidation (middle), we propose integrating continuous neural
(e.g., electroencephalogram, EEG) and biological measures (e.g., heart rate and pupil
size) with neural decoding methods to detect spontaneous memory reactivation/replay
during sleep or periods of wakeful rest. During memory retrieval (right), we suggest
that retrieval paradigms such as drawing, creative writing, and artificial intelligence
(AI)-based memory sensitivity are more appropriate for measuring memory
representations of artworks in the human memory system compared to traditional
paradigms like the recognition test. Additionally, computational methods (e.g., NLP and
DMN) can unveil comprehensive information in participants’ drawings and writings.
3.1 Memory Encoding
To empirically investigate memory encoding of artworks, we propose the integration of
naturalistic neuroimaging with facial expression tracking. These methodologies
facilitate concurrent recording of participants' brain responses and facial expressions,
potentially representing neural and affective processing, respectively. Naturalistic
neuroimaging aims to study the brain functions under conditions that closely mimic
real-world, natural experiences such as listening to music, watching movies, or
appreciating paintings 24–26. While not originally designed for memory studies, many
naturalistic neuroimaging protocols can be easily adapted to examine memory encoding.
Specifically, following the perception phase in which artworks are displayed to
participants, successful memory formation can be assessed during retrieval. This allows
for the analysis of brain activity from the perception phase based on whether the stimuli
were remembered or forgotten, thereby identifying the presence of the SME in the
human brain. However, leveraging artworks to pinpoint SME necessitates the
development of innovative statistical frameworks that extend beyond traditional
contrast-based subsequent memory analyses.
Here, we introduced four principal statistical frameworks for analyzing naturistic
type of neuroimaging data, we summarize each based on their underlying statistical
principles. Consequently, with appropriate modifications, these frameworks can be
generalized for application from one type of neuroimaging to another, such as from
fMRI to EEG. It is noteworthy that these methodologies have already been employed
to analyze movie datasets and can also be applied to other dynamic art forms such as
music, poetry, and novels. Inter-subject correlation (ISC) analysis is an approach for
measuring shared information representation across the brains of different participants36.
Recently, Sheng and colleagues utilized this framework and discovered that common
activation patterns mirrored shared memory content within a traditional trial-based
memory encoding paradigm37. When applying this framework to a movie-based
memory encoding study, Hasson and colleagues identified SME effects in regions such
as the parahippocampal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, anterior temporal poles, and
temporal-parietal junction38. However, due to limited sample size, Hasson and
colleagues did not explore whether shared neural response patterns observed while
participants watched the movie could predict a similar memory structure during
subsequent retrieval. Given the nature of artworks, we propose that this could be a
valuable question with two plausible yet contrasting predictions. On one hand, it can be
hypothesized that after exposure to a variety of artworks, participants will exhibit a
more similar memory structure compared to other types of stimuli, supported by similar
neural response patterns during encoding. This is due to the presence of key universal
factors influencing memory formation such as emotion and reward, which should be
consistent across participants and hence drive similar neural activities, making a work
of art more memorable than others. On the other hand, the highly personal and
subjective nature of processing art could result in more diverse neural responses during
encoding, leading to larger individual differences in memory structure. Voxel-wise
encoding models provide a precise method for constructing a semantic atlas of the
cerebral cortex39. This approach is particularly valuable for artworks abundant in
linguistic information such as songs, poetry, and novels. Compared to traditional
localization approaches, this model reveals the multiple-to-multiple mapping between
semantic concepts and brain areas throughout the cerebral cortex. If the representation
of semantic concepts is distributed, the subsequent question to explore is how the
general memory network interacts with specific brain areas to complete memory
encoding. Conversely, the decoding model aims to reconstruct stimuli from brain
activity; for example, reconstructing music from human auditory cortex activity40. The
integration of encoding and decoding models could illuminate the fundamental
principles of memory encoding and retrieval, and how they are represented by similar
neural patterns. Among various theories to understand memory formation of dynamic
art, we propose that event segmentation41,42 is the most promising candidate. In
cognitive psychology, event segmentation theory postulates that continuous
information flow is segmented into smaller units for efficient perceptual and mnemonic
processing43. This concept, however, is challenging to study using contrast-based
neuroimaging analyses. Recently, two independent research teams were able to identify
event boundaries based on shifts in brain activity patterns44–46. Employing the Hidden
Markov Model (HMM), distinct states within brain response patterns observed during
continuous movie watching were recognized44. In addition, hippocampal activity
detected immediately after an event boundary predicted neural reactivation during
subsequent memory retrieval. This finding aligns with recent discoveries that human-
generated event boundaries trigger hippocampal response, where neural patterns of the
previous movie event are rapidly replayed 47–49. Nevertheless, the observation that
neural-based event boundaries coupled with hippocampal activity and pattern
reactivation provides only indirect evidence of event segmentation's role in memory
formation. Utilizing Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), originally
developed to measure information representation on a trial-by-trial basis, Liu and
colleagues measured event segmentation during movie watching, demonstrating that
the degree of segmentation, indexed by neural similarity, could predict subsequent
memory performance50. Event segmentation has also been explored, at a more refined
timescale, in other art forms such as novels, poetry, and music. Ding and colleagues
first outlined the hierarchy of neural processing timescales during connected speech51.
This analytical framework was subsequently applied to detect a similar type of
segmentation processing occurring when listening to poetry and music52,53. Based on
our findings that event segmentation during movie watching predicts subsequent
memory retrieval, we hypothesize this may also hold true for poetry and music. Our lab
is currently conducting experiments to investigate this possibility by combining the
subsequent memory paradigm with event segmentation.
(A) Inter-Subject Correlation (ISC): Chen et al. used ISC to analyze fMRI data of
participants recalling the same movie scene, quantifying the degree of similarity in
neural representations for the same memory across individuals. This led to the
conclusion that there are common neural representations underlying retrieval across
brains (Chen et al., 2017, Nature Neuroscience). This method can also be applied to
brain responses recorded by other imaging modalities, such as functional near-infrared
spectroscopy (fNIRS). (B) Voxel-wise Encoding Models (VEM): Huth et al. applied
VEM to fMRI recordings of participants listening to narrative speech to discover
multiple-to-multiple relationships between semantic concepts and brain areas, creating
a detailed functional organization of the semantic atlas (Huth et al., 2016, Nature). We
propose using this method to study how the human brain forms memories for poetry,
predicting that semantic maps of poetry will be less consistent across individuals than
those of natural language representations. (C) Hidden Marko Model (HMM):
Bardassano et al. utilized HMM to analyze continuous brain measures and identified
the event segmentation process during both memory encoding and retrieval. Notably,
the event segmentation revealed a nested hierarchy from short events in sensory regions
to long events in higher-order areas, primarily the default model network (DMN)
(Bardassano et al., 2017, Neuron). (D) Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA).
Wei and colleagues applied the RSA to analyze activation patterns and connectivity
patterns before and after event segmentation and identified the hippocampal-prefrontal
event processing signatures predicts subsequent free recall and order memory measures
(Wei Liu et al., 2022, Cerebral Cortex). This is the critical demonstration that RSA can
be used to analyze naturalistic neuroimaging data and predict memory performance.
Another critical question to consider is how emotional fluctuations during memory
encoding of artworks can predict subsequent memory performance. Although art-
triggered emotions are often too subtle and complex to be measured by functional brain
imaging (e.g., quantify activations in amygdala) or biological responses (e.g., heart rate,
blood pressure, or pupil size), real-time facial expression tracking presents a novel way
to track emotional reactions. By applying this method to video recording while
participants watched a movie, Chang and colleagues generated multiple time series of
complex emotional responses including but not limited to hope, sadness, surprise, fear,
and contempt 54. While they did not investigate how these facial expression-based
emotional responses predict subsequent memory performance, they already validated
the strong relationships between facial expression readouts and self-reported emotional
experiences across four studies. This validation paves the way for future application of
this method in memory encoding studies.
With the advent of artificial intelligence, it is now also feasible to employ objective
computational methods such as computer vision and content analysis to extract “unseen”
features from artworks themselves (Rohrbach et al., 2017; Ying Li et al., 2006). These
computationally generated features can be used as additional predictor in neuroimaging
data analysis, shedding novel light on the process of memory formation. For instance,
a promising approach is extracting the emotional features directly from visual (i.e.,
painting), auditory (i.e., music), or combined visual-auditory content (e.g., movies).
Kragel and colleagues developed a convolutional neural network (i.e., EmoNet) that
decodes movie contents into 11 distinct emotion categories on a frame-by-frame basis
55. Future research could correlate these time series of different emotion categories with
dynamically changing brain activity during movie watching to predict subsequent
memory performance.
3.2 Memory Consolidation
Memory consolidation plays a crucial role in transforming newly encoded, unstable
information into durable long-term memories 56. Despite its importance, our
understanding of the consolidation process regarding art memories remains limited. We
argue for an increase in empirical studies to shed light on the consolidation of art
memories, noting that prior studies have predominantly centered on art perception and
memory formation. We suggest that an individualized memory reconstruction
process predominantly occurs spontaneously during consolidation. We will address the
technical challenges of studying human memory consolidation, emphasizing art
memories, and highlight recent advancements in both experimental and computational
methodologies to overcome these obstacles.
Investigating the consolidation of art memories can offer unique insights into their
mnemonic advantages. Although direct experimental comparisons are challenging, it's
widely acknowledged that artworks are typically better remembered than non-art
everyday stimuli. Previous memory encoding research indicates that this mnemonic
advantage might arise from associated emotional responses 57,58, aesthetics-induced
rewarding 59–61, and self-reference effects 62,63. While these effects were initially
identified with non-art stimuli, recent investigations have employed artworks to
validate these traditional memory encoding effects. For instance, contemporary
research has simulated scenarios where participants visit a museum with paintings
displayed, aiming to understand appreciation and recall of artworks. While the
perceptual attributes of paintings can predict memorability 64, factors such as
motivation 65, self-relevance 66, and aesthetic experience 67 play a role in memory
formation. We posit that these aforementioned emotional, motivational, and aesthetic
elements persist beyond encoding, enhancing memory consolidation for artworks, with
artworks. Artworks, such as music, movies, and novels, naturally generate sequential
information during memory formation. This can be captured by non-invasive
neuroimaging techniques (e.g., fMRI, EEG, and MEG) during the consolidation phase.
Following initial encoding, this sequential information may undergo replay during
periods of wakeful rest and/or sleep. We propose that the emotional responses and
aesthetic rewards associated with artworks may enhance this memory replay, which in
turn leads to enhanced memory retrieval. It is important to note that memory replay
may not simply mirror the original sequence. The sequence order may be reversed, the
specificity of information may decrease, and multiple sequences may be replayed
concurrently. Hence, memory consolidation plays a crucial role in the proposed
individualized memory reconstruction process.
However, investigating the neural mechanisms underlying memory consolidation
presents a significant challenge due to the extended and unpredictable consolidation
timeline. Cognitive theories of memory consolidation suggest that the stabilization of
newly formed memories occurs spontaneously either during wakeful rest or sleep 68,69.
Chronic implantation techniques are employed in animal studies for continuous data
collection during the post-encoding consolidation phase. However, this method is not
feasible for human participants. Nonetheless, continuous neural measures play a vital
role in the study of human memory consolidation, ideally collected immediately post-
encoding and during sleep if possible.
Currently, there are two settings where these measures can be appropriately obtained.
Firstly, in the case of patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy, clinical requirements
necessitate the invasive implantation of electrodes to monitor abnormal neural activities.
Utilizing this unique opportunity, Zhang and colleagues identified electrophysiological
markers of memory consolidation during wakeful rest and sleep 70. Critically,
intracranial stimulation during sleep enhanced the coupling of hippocampal–prefrontal
neuronal oscillations and improved memory performance 71. Secondly, for healthy
participants, the precision neuroimaging approach can be employed whereby neural
activity of a small group of participants is densely sampled 72. For instance, in the dream
decoding study, in total of 900 sessions of dreaming-waking experiments were collected
from three participants. They demonstrated that visual content during dreams can be
decoded based on a model trained on fMRI signals during visual perception. This
provides strong evidence that spontaneously emerging visual information during dream
is driven by similar neural pattern reactivations 73.
In addition to neural measures, we propose continuous recording of biological
measures such as pupil size, heart rate, blood pressure, and Skin Conductance
Response (SCR) in conjunction with neural responses to effectively study the
consolidation of art memories. Antony et al. (2021) reported a correlation between the
incidence of surprise during sports viewership and subsequent memory recall, as
indicated by behavioral, physiological, and neural markers 74. Although basketball
games do not fall within our initial definition of artworks, the surprise signal examined
in this context is also prevalent in responses to artworks such as movies and music.
Hence, future research could adopt similar methodologies to document and analyze
biological reactions to artworks. Considering the emotional responses elicited by art
appreciation, it is plausible to hypothesize that if art memories are reactivated during
consolidation, corresponding biological responses linked to emotional reactions will
reoccur. It is worth noting that due to the spontaneous reactivation of memory
representations during consolidation, we lack reliable behavioral measures to validate
neural-based memory decoding outcomes. In other words, we have no objective means
to evaluate the accuracy if the classifier indicates the reactivation of specific content.
This issue can be partially mitigated using proposed continuous biological measures.
Detecting the reactivation of certain art memories (ideally emotional) can allow for a
comparison of the biological measures at those times with measures taken at other time
points when no memories are reactivating. If the reported time points associated with
reactivated art memories correspond to, for instance, an elevated heart rate and blood
pressure, we can have greater confidence in the neural decoding outcomes.
Moreover, the complex temporal and spatial features of artworks generate sequential
information, posing another challenge in describing its consolidation process. As such,
we need to measure memory replay, rather than memory reactivation, during
consolidation for artworks. In contrast to memory reactivation, which involves a single
stimulus (like a picture or word), memory replay involves the reactivation of sequential
(both temporal and spatial) information. Memory replay was first identified in the
rodent hippocampus during post-task sleep 75. Hippocampal "place cells" were
sequentially activated as animals moved in a specific direction, each with a preferred
firing field in space. Notably, similar temporal order neural activation patterns were
observed during sleep, termed as “memory replay.” Detecting the reactivation of
multiple specific memories in sequences based on brain activities is challenging due to
the compressed sequence replay and the often unknown speed. Recent studies have
provided convincing evidence for human memory replay during rest 76,77, and
subsequent studies have outlined corresponding experimental design and statistical
tools (e.g., Temporally delayed linear modelling (TDLM)) for future human memory
replay studies78,79 However, memory replay can also be studied through behavioral
experiments without the need for neural measures. A recent study explored the memory
replay of music and provided behavioral evidence that spontaneous mental replay of
music improves memory for incidentally associated event knowledge80. There exists an
intriguing phenomenon whereby memory replay during consolidation may not merely
mirror the original sequence. The sequence order might be reversed, the specificity of
information could decrease, and several sequences might be replayed simultaneously.
This suggests that the functions of memory replay extend beyond merely consolidating
received information. As such, prior theoretical models proposed that memory replay
plays a critical role in future planning81. Additionally, given empirical findings
demonstrating that sleep can facilitate insight82 and problem-solving83, Lewis and
colleagues proposed that memory replay during sleep enhances creativity by forming
novel and unexpected connections within existing cortically coded knowledge84.
Building on this concept and considering the connection between artworks and
creativity, we propose that memory replay underpins the suggested individualized
memory reconstruction. In order to investigate these relationships, it is necessary to not
only quantify the occurrence of memory replay but also assess its mathematical
properties (such as speed, sequences, accuracy, and interactions between multiple
sequences) through the use of computational modelling to decoding outcomes. By
elucidating how artworks are replayed during consolidation, we may leverage neural
measures to make predictions about the outcomes of memory reconstruction during
retrieval (as discussed in the subsequent section).
3.3 Memory Retrieval
Given the unique nature of art memories discussed above, characteristics of art
memories mentioned earlier, we suggest using innovative paradigms such as drawing,
memory-based creative writing, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based memory
sensitivity tests to measure memory retrieval. Traditional memory studies typically
rely on recognition and/or cue-based recall tests for assessing episodic memories. Free
recall tests are occasionally employed, but their use in neuroimaging experiments is
less frequent due to their limitations in time-locking and averaging neural responses
repetitions. These tests share the assumption that stored memory representations should
mirror the input sensory information, which can then be utilized during retrieval.
However, as we propose that neural representations of artworks undergo an
individualized reconstruction process, the introduction of novel retrieval paradigms
may be necessary. We will explore these promising paradigms and related
computational methods and explain why and how they can provide a more reasonable
measure of the individualized memory reconstruction.
Firstly, we propose that drawing serves as a retrieval test to measure art memories85.
While drawings typically serve to document current visual experiences, participants can
also be instructed to produce drawings based on their prior experiences, serving as a
novel test for memory retrieval. We highlight three distinct advantages of this approach:
(A) Beyond a simple remember/forget (i.e., all-or-none) outcome in other retrieval
paradigms, experimenters can assess the degree of visual detail participants have
actually encoded; (B) Drawings are subject to perceptual distortions and memory decay,
and influenced by participants' individual memory systems, thus providing a means to
measure how incoming information interact with pre-exist knowledge system to
support the individualized processes during memory reconstruction; (C) Beyond
recording visual experiences, drawing can also be used to measure knowledge, abstract
concepts, and logical progression. If the process of drawing is recorded, we can even
infer participants' cognitive structures by analyzing the sequence in which elements
appear during the drawing process.
Secondly, we propose the utilization of memory-based creative writing86. This
method involves initially recalling elements depicted in artworks, such as novels,
movies, or poetry (visual arts like paintings are possible but involves cross-modality
memory reconstruction, see below) and subsequently generating content that is absent
in the original art, based on participants' imagination. We assume that this imaginative
process is supported by the dynamic interplay between art-related memories and
participants' personal memory and knowledge systems. The retrieval component
closely resembles the free-recall method employed in prior research to measure movie
memories 50,87, while the creative writing aspect is commonly used in creativity
assessments88. By analyzing the parallels in participants' responses during retrieval-
based writing and creative writing, we can discern the behavioral implications of
individualized memory reconstruction. Importantly, experimenters have the capacity to
manipulate the nature of instructions participants receive prior to memory encoding,
preparing them for either a free recall test or a creative writing task rooted in memory.
We postulate that emphasizing memory-based creative writing in pre-encoding
instructions could provoke a greater extent of individualized memory reconstruction.
Should we discover that the introduction of creative writing instructions prior to
encoding induces more varied neural response patterns amongst participants during
encoding, we may surmise that the timing of individualized memory reconstruction
could precede even consolidation and could be noticeable during the encoding stage.
Thirdly, we propose the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-based memory sensitivity
tests during retrieval. In the context of recognition texts, one key confounding factor is
familiarity89. Familiarity appears to be an unavoidable factor in memory studies, even
in traditional experiments featuring objects like faces, buildings, and words, and is
amplified when dealing with artworks. However, we argue that familiarity with
artworks is subject to greater control. Factors such as cultural background and
geographical location heavily influence an individual's exposure to various artworks.
For instance, a typical college student from a Western country is unlikely to have
enough exposure to Chinese paintings to evoke familiarity during memory experiments.
Moreover, the development of AI-based algorithms for art creation facilitates the
generation of unlimited unique stimuli for memory studies. For example, a
magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiment employed Chinese poetry created by the
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as experimental materials53 Diffusion models have
been utilized to create "paintings" based on a user's text input90,91. Notably, this type of
images in a certain artist's signature style, offering materials for recognition memory
tests and/or the false memory paradigm. Vessel et al., used deep neural networks to
generate personalized, synthetic artworks, which were found to be rated as more
aesthetically appealing than controls66. These synthetic artworks, generated by the
aforementioned algorithms, can be utilized in the encoding phase to explore whether
the memory advantages of artworks are exclusive to real artworks and cannot be
generalized to synthetic ones. During the retrieval phase, these synthetic artworks can
serve as lures in recognition tests. As these algorithms can be programmed to produce
highly similar artworks, they can be employed to investigate memory sensitivity (i.e.,
the ability of participants to correctly select true old items and reject highly similar
ones). We posit that individualized memory reconstruction may act as a double-edged
sword: while artworks showcase general memory advantages, they may result in
reduced sensitivity. During reconstruction, while gist information is largely retained,
detailed information is lost, leading to low memory sensitivity during retrieval. Without
the aid of AI, it is nearly impossible to find item-specific artworks highly similar to the
original artwork, hence, the memory disadvantages of artworks may be overlooked. We
offer a concise overview of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms discussed in this
reference for readers interested in further exploration.

As previously introduced, promising retrieval paradigms may measure art memories
more accurately and AI-based method have been used to extract features from artworks
during memory encoding. This section expands on the discussion on integrating these
experimental and computational approaches to quantify individualized memory
gauged the dynamic transformation of memory representations by the encoding-
retrieval similarity, i.e., the correlation between the neural response patterns during
encoding and retrieval. A significant limitation of this strategy is the absence of a
corresponding behavioral measure of memory reconstruction. Hence, we cannot
provide trial-specific evidence to demonstrate how neural pattern transformations
influence memory trace alterations. For simple episodic memories, if recognition or
free recall tests are employed during retrieval, it is commonly observed that encoding-
retrieval similarities are higher for remembered than forgotten trials33–35. However, this
finding, while supporting the concept of pattern reinstatement, fails to map the
relationships between behavioral and neural measures of individualized memory
reconstruction for art memories.
We propose that considering the properties of artworks and the aim to behaviorally
measure the memory reconstruction, drawing and writing can replace the traditional
remember or forget framework as retrieval outcomes. Drawing can measure the
memory not only for visual art, such as painting, sculpture, and movie but also art
formats without visual stimuli, including but not limited to music, poetry, and novels.
This function is particularly valuable to measure the cross-modality memory
reconstruction, i.e., from auditory and language to a visual model through
individualized imagination. In contrast, writing can measure cross-modality memory
reconstruction in the opposite direction, where information from the auditory or visual
modalities is stored in the memory system and then retrieved in the format of language.
A technical challenge lies in measuring encoding-retrieval similarity between, for
instance, original paintings and participants’ responses, or between presented visual-
auditory movies and participants’ writings. We suggest using AI-based methods for
comparison, deeming human-based ratings from additional experimenters as
suboptimal. Among various AI-based methods to analyze visual images and texts, we
focus on the value Deep Neural Networks (DNN), as their outputs can largely mimic
the hierarchical structure of the human mind (i.e., from perception to semantic and
abstract level). Previous studies on perception and memory quantified presented images
using the DNN method and compare layer-specific information representations across
different memory stages92,93, between perception and imagination94, between infants
and adults95. By simultaneously applying the DNN to presented artworks and
participants’ drawings, it is possible to investigate which level of information
underwent the most significant changes during memory reconstruction. Crucially, a
similar DNN approach can be applied to neural response patterns during encoding and
retrieval, decomposing raw neural patterns into combinations of multiple meaningful
patterns. The integration of drawing/writing and DNN can explore whether the gist of
an artwork persists from encoding to retrieval, with corresponding neural patterns
remaining consistent, while detailed visual features transform in a personalized manner
accompanied by unstable neural patterns.
behavioral and neural levels. (A) Drawing as a retrieval task: For static art forms
such as painting and sculpture, we propose that drawing, as opposed to recognition tests,
may provide a more detailed measure of individualized memory reconstruction. (B)
Writing as a retrieval task. For dynamic art forms like films and novels, beyond free
recall, we suggest that memory-based creative writing could be further adapted to
observe the interactions between the participants' existing memory structures and new
information. (C) Use of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to measure encoding-
retrieval similarity to reflect the memory reconstruction: At the behavioral level,
the DNN can extract unseen features from both the original paintings and participants'
drawings to calculate the similarity measures at different layers of the network (e.g.,
visual, semantic, and concept). Comparable analyses can also be conducted for dynamic
art, transforming written responses into meaningful vectors using natural language
processing. At the neural level, we can identify specific time windows and/or brain
regions that represent information in similar ways, decompose neural response patterns,
and correlate these with different memory measures.
4. Summary
This perspective article seeks to synergize two distinct yet overlapping research
domains: neuroaesthetics96 and the study of human memory. Despite their unique
theoretical objectives, both fields significantly benefit from the implementation of non-
invasive human brain imaging methodologies. By emphasizing the distinctive
contributions of studying human memory systems through the lens of artworks, we aim
to stimulate fresh insights into the cognitive and neural mechanisms of human memory.
This ambitious task necessitates interdisciplinary collaboration from psychologists,
neuroscientists, computer scientists, and notably, artists. Concrete strategies such as
organizing cross-disciplinary workshops and conferences, establishing
interdisciplinary research grants, developing digital platforms for exchange of ideas,
stimuli, data, and software, could significantly facilitate this collaboration. We
anticipate that studying the memory of artworks may ultimately shed light on the
fundamental principles underlying how artists convey their ideas, emotions, and
imaginations to audiences, and how these contents are stored as shared memories
between artists and audiences.
