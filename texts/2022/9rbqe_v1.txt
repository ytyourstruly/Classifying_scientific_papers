WHO BENEFITS MOST? PERSONALITY, YOGA AND MEDITATION 3
Abstract
Mind-Body Medicine (MBM) includes a broad range of interventions of proven preven-
tive and clinical value, such as yoga and meditation. However, people differ in their preferences
and response to different MBM treatments, and it remains unclear who benefits most from
what type of practice. Thus, finding moderators of treatment outcome seems to be a promising
approach. This was the aim of the present study. We conducted a single-case multiple-baseline
study investigating the outcomes and moderators of four different MBM treatments. Fifty-
seven healthy participants with no prior experience were randomly assigned to three baselines
(7, 14, and 21 days) and four eight-week treatments: mantra meditation alone, meditation plus
physical yoga, meditation plus ethical education, and meditation plus yoga and ethical educa-
tion. We analysed the data using effect size estimation, multiple regression and cluster anal-
yses. High anxiety, high absorption, low spirituality, low openness and younger age were asso-
ciated with a range of positive outcomes, such as increased well-being or decentering and de-
creased mind-wandering. Receiving ethical education consistently improved well-being, while
engaging in physical yoga reduced mind-wandering. In the cluster analysis, we found that par-
ticipants with a more maladaptive personality structure enhanced their emotion regulation
skills more. Consequently, people do differ in their response to MBM interventions and more
vulnerable people, or those high in absorption, seem to benefit more. These findings could
guide the development of custom-tailored MBM interventions and help clinicians to make sci-
entifically sound recommendations for their patients.

Introduction
Mind-Body Medicine (MBM) as part of Complementary and Integrative Medicine
(CIM), especially yoga and meditation, are becoming increasingly popular in the therapeutic
setting, but also as self-medication in prevention and for stress management. These methods
are widely used as an adjunct to conventional therapy, and evidence of efficacy exists for
chronic somatic disorders (Hartley et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2016), in rehabilitation (Lawrence
et al., 2017), and in mental disorders (Broderick et al., 2017; Klatte et al., 2016), amongst oth-
ers. However, it remains unclear who benefits most from what type of practice. Moreover, it is
unclear how different components of MBM interventions influence their overall effects. Tradi-
tional yoga, for example, entails meditation, postures, breathing practices and ethical guide-
lines (Feuerstein, 2013; Telles & Singh, 2013). A recent meta-synthesis exemplified how differ-
ent combinations of these practices have differential and incremental effects on diverse varia-
bles and populations (Matko, Bringmann, et al., 2021). Furthermore, customised treatments
were often found to be more effective than standard MBM treatments (Bragard et al., 2017;
Simon et al., 2021). Thus, it seems advisable to identify potential moderators or effective com-
ponents for specific populations, conditions and individual aims.
Personalised medicine, that is, the treatment of patients based on their individual (phe-
notypic and [epi-]genetic) predisposition, patient preferences and personality traits, promises
to fundamentally transform healthcare. It enables (clinical) research to find specific and more
effective strategies for prevention and therapy (Chapman et al., 2014; Edwards, 2012). MBM
research so far has shown that people differ in their preferences regarding different psycholog-
ical treatments (Williams et al., 2016), meditation techniques (Anderson & Farb, 2018; Burke,
2012), and practices of multi-component interventions that they use at home (Carmody et al.,
2009). In addition, earlier studies found substantial interindividual variation in response to
different contemplative treatments (Matko, Sedlmeier, et al., 2021a; May et al., 2014), and to
psychotherapy (Saunders et al., 2019; Stulz et al., 2007). Several researchers pointed out that
personality and other personality traits might tremendously influence the effects of meditation
and yoga in this regard (Hölzel et al., 2011; Schmalzl et al., 2015; Tang & Braver, 2020). Yet,
WHO BENEFITS MOST? PERSONALITY, YOGA AND MEDITATION 5
only few studies explicitly investigated how different personality traits influence the outcomes
of MBM interventions (de Vibe et al., 2015; Nyklíček & Irrmischer, 2017; van den Hurk et al.,
2011).
Similarly, in MBM research, there is only little research with respect to the questions
“which treatment is better for whom, when, and why?”¾ contrary to other areas of psycholog-
ical and clinical research (Caspi & Bell, 2004). Yet, matching individuals with fitting MBM
treatments based on their personality and preferences could be valuable. It could reduce the
likelihood of attrition, facilitate adherence and self-maintenance of practices, and, conse-
quently, improve the effectiveness and outcomes of the intervention (Anderson & Farb, 2018;
Tang & Braver, 2020).
Hence, this study investigates which personality traits moderate the outcomes of four
different MBM treatments. The treatments are based on the Meditation Based Lifestyle Modi-
fication intervention (MBLM; Bringmann et al., 2020, 2021), which combines mantra medita-
tion, physical yoga, and psychoeducation on the ethical roots of yoga. In this study, we examine
four different combinations of these three components using a single-case multiple baseline
design. At the same time, we collected a broad range of personality traits as possible modera-
tors of treatment outcome.
Experimental single-case designs (Barlow et al., 2009) overcome limitations of conven-
tional group designs as they take into account heterogeneity between individuals and are thus
able to depict interindividual changes in response to a treatment. Furthermore, the data are
collected continuously over extended periods of time during two phases (baseline and treat-
ment), creating a high time resolution and increasing the reliability of the measurements. Par-
ticipants in these designs serve as their own control as their baseline data is compared with
their treatment data. In multiple-baseline designs, the treatment introduction is staggered
across different participants providing experimental control and making horizontal and verti-
cal comparisons possible (Ferron et al., 2014). Recently, many sophisticated ways of analysing
the results of single-case studies have been established, including several suitable effect size
measures (Pustejovsky, 2019). Therefore, this design is highly suited to address an explorative
WHO BENEFITS MOST? PERSONALITY, YOGA AND MEDITATION 6
research question such as ours, namely, “Who benefits most from what type of treatment?”.
Answering this question might help to make scientifically informed recommendations for dif-
ferent MBM treatments, based on individual characteristics and preferences, in the future.
Methods
Procedure
The present study used a single-case multiple-baseline design to examine the effects of
four different eight-week MBM treatments, based on MBLM intervention (Bringmann et al.,
2020), on a variety of dependent variables. Furthermore, we assessed a multitude of
personality traits during pre-test to find possible moderators of the observed effects.
Participants received daily online questionnaires throughout their entire baseline and
treatment phases. The treatment conditions were mantra meditation alone (MA), mantra
meditation plus physical Hatha yoga (MY), mantra meditation plus ethical education (ME),
and mantra meditation plus physical yoga and ethical education (MYE). We randomised
participants across these four conditions and across three baseline lengths (7, 14 or 21 days)
using simple random sampling without replacement. A detailed breakdown of the study
methods and the four treatments can be found in Matko et al. (2021a).
Transparency and Openness
We report our methods, all data exclusions, and all measures of the study, and we follow
the Single-Case Reporting Guideline in BEhavioral Interventions (Tate et al., 2016). All
statistical analyses were performed using R 4.2.0 (R Core Team, 2022) and the statistical
packages ggpubr (Kassambara, 2020), lm.beta (Behrendt, 2014), rstatix (Kassambara, 2021),
and scan (Wilbert & Lueke, 2019). All scripts and data that support the results can be found at
Participants
Participants were recruited from the Dresden general community via flyers and mailing
lists. They had to be older than 18 years, have no regular yoga or meditation practice, and no

pre-existing psychiatric conditions or acute psychological issues. Participation was voluntary
and all participants provided written consent to participate in the study. Participants were fully
disclosed about the nature of the study prior to randomisation and data collection, but could
not choose or switch treatments. There was no financial or other compensation for
participation in the study, except for the opportunity to win one of ten €50 gift coupons. The
institutional review board of the Chemnitz University of Technology approved the
experimental protocol.
Treatment
All treatments were jointly led by HCB, an accredited psychiatrist and psychotherapist,
and KM, a psychologist and certified yoga instructor with 700 hrs of teacher training. The
length of the weekly sessions varied across conditions, but each condition included a group
discussion of experiences at the beginning and end of each session as well as a 25-min silent
mantra meditation practice. During the physical Hatha yoga practice, participants learned a
set of simple yoga postures, simple breathing techniques, the sun salutation, and relaxation
techniques. Ethical education followed the protocol developed for the MBLM mind–body
program (Bringmann et al., 2020), introducing and discussing a new topic of the yogic yamas
and niyamas each week. We asked all participants to practice their respective treatment
practices daily, that is, 20 min of mantra meditation, 20 min of yoga exercises, and/or engage
in mindful living activities related to the ethical topic of the week.
Measures
All measures were taken online using SoSci Survey (Leiner, 2019). We assessed
multiple personality traits during pre-test using various instruments. Trait absorption was
measured with the 34-item modified German version of the Tellegen Absorption Scale (Ritz &
Dahme, 1995). It reflects a person’s disposition for episodes of fully engaged attention. The
21-item Big Five Inventory-Short Form (BFI-K; Rammstedt & John, 2005) was utilised for
capturing the Big Five personality traits: extraversion, neuroticism, openness to experience,
conscientiousness, and agreeableness. Distress tolerance was assessed using the 15-item
WHO BENEFITS MOST? PERSONALITY, YOGA AND MEDITATION 8
Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS; Simons & Gaher, 2005). It measures the degree to which
individuals experience negative emotions as intolerable. We employed the 14-item German
translation of the Need for Cognition subscale of the Rational-Experiential Inventory (Keller
et al., 2000) to measure participants’ need for cognition or, in other words, their engagement
in a rational processing style. Self-compassion was measured with the 26-item German
version of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS-D; Hupfeld & Ruffieux, 2011), which assesses one’s
ability to be kind and forgiving to oneself in difficult circumstances. The 20-item Aspects of
Spirituality Questionnaire (ASP-20; Büssing et al., 2014) was employed to assess participants
spirituality. We measured trait anxiety (participants’ general tendency to worry) with the 20-
item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Laux et al., 1981). Participants’ life satisfaction was
measured with the 5-item German version of the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS; Glaesmer
et al., 2011).
In addition, we assessed the manifestation of the three gunas and the proportion of
sattvaguna in our participants using a 79-item version of the Tri-Guna Scales (TGS; Puta,
2015). According to the tri-guna concept from ancient Indian Samkhya philosophy,
eudaimonic wellbeing is influenced by three different qualities: the three gunas sattva
(purity), rajas (energy), and tamas (inertia). The combination of these three qualities
determines the personality of a given person (Puta & Sedlmeier, 2014).
Over the course of the baseline and treatment phases, we continuously collected several
dependent variables: Affective experience (valence and arousal) was measured daily with the
economic single-item measure Affective Grid (Russell et al., 1989). The multi-layered
construct of body awareness was assessed twice weekly with the help of a newly developed
questionnaire combining 11 items of established questionnaires (see Matko, Sedlmeier, et al.,
2021b). Decentering, which implies having a distanced perspective on one’s internal
experiences, was measured weekly with the 11-item Experiences Questionnaire-Decentering
Scale (EQ-D; Fresco et al., 2007). Emotion regulation was measured weekly with a shortened
version (see Matko, Sedlmeier, et al., 2021b) of the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale
(DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 2003). Mind-wandering was assessed twice weekly using the short,
five-item Mind-Wandering Questionnaire (MWQ; Mrazek et al., 2013). The Result-oriented
WHO BENEFITS MOST? PERSONALITY, YOGA AND MEDITATION 9
Problem- and Self-reflection Scale was developed for evaluating coaching outcomes related to
increased abilities of self-reflection and self-regulation (RoPS; Greif & Berg, 2011). We used
the subscale Reflection of Concrete Changes from this inventory to assess self-reflection once
a week. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10; Cohen & Williamson, 1988) was employed weekly
to measure participants’ stress. We measured participants’ well-being daily using the 5-item
World Health Organization Wellbeing Index (WHO-5; World Health Organization, 1998). All
questionnaires (except life satisfaction and the affective grid) were rated on a 5-point Likert
scale.
To measure sustained attention and vigilance, we employed the Sustained Attention to
Response Task (SART; Robertson et al., 1997) twice weekly. It is a classic go/no-go task. On
each trial, participants were presented with a digit from 1 to 9 for 250 ms which was then
masked for 900 ms. They were requested to press the space key on each trial (go condition)
except for those trials presenting the digit 3 (no-go condition). Altogether there were 207 trials
(11.1 % no-go, 88.9 % go) and the total duration of the task was approximately 5 minutes. We
Irvine et al., 2020). For this study, we only report changes in the number of incorrect no-go
trials (falsely pressing instead of inhibiting the response).
We inverted the effect sizes for attention (number of incorrect no-go trials) and emo-
tion regulation (difficulties) to increase readability. Thus, higher scores reflect positive in-
creases uniformly in all variables.
Data Analysis
Single-case data can be analysed in multiple ways (Machalicek & Horner, 2018;
Shadish, 2014) as we reported and outlined in previous publications (Matko, Sedlmeier, et al.,
2021a, 2021b). In the present study, we focus on the effect sizes that we estimated for each
dependent variable to assess the treatment effect. We employed Tau-U, which is a non-
parametric effect size estimate specifically developed for experimental single-case research
that allows for controlling trends observed in both phases (Parker et al., 2011). We corrected
trends in any phase when they were statistically significant or larger than .40. An effect size of
WHO BENEFITS MOST? PERSONALITY, YOGA AND MEDITATION 10
less than 0.28 indicated a small effect; 0.29–0.47 a moderate effect; 0.48–0.57 a large effect;
and 0.58 or above a very large effect (Solomon et al., 2015). Furthermore, we calculated the
total effect for each participant. First, we inverted all effect sizes where a negative effect size
represented an effect in the expected direction, that is, in regard to attention, emotion
regulation, mind-wandering, and stress. Then we obtained the average value across all
dependent variables.
We conducted multiple regression analyses to determine moderating factors that
influenced the observed changes in each dependent variable and the total effect. Therefore, we
entered the Tau-U effect sizes as criterion and all personality traits as predictors into the
regression model. Moreover, we statistically controlled individual practice time, age, gender,
occupation, and baseline length by including them in the model. Individual practice time
represents sum scores of the reported length of each practice participants engaged with at
home. In addition, we examined the incremental effects of the four conditions by entering two
dummy variables into the model that coded the inclusion of either the physical yoga or the
ethical education component. For these two dummy variables, we applied one-tailed tests of
significance as we expected combined interventions to have stronger effects than the simple
meditation intervention.
We performed cluster analysis to identify groups of participants that were similar in
their personality profile and explore how these groups generally responded to the treatments.
We first standardised all variables, then calculated euclidean distances between them and
submitted these to a Ward’s hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis. Then, we inspected
the resulting dendrogram to identify the number of clusters present in the data. Next, we
exploratively examined differences between the clusters by generating comparative box plots
and conducting multiple t-tests. We did not correct for multiple comparisons because of the
exploratory nature of our analysis. Thereby, we compared clusters regarding the different
dependent variables and with respect to the above-mentioned personality traits. In addition,
we investigated how the clusters were distributed across the different conditions.

and decreased for those high in life satisfaction at baseline. For decentering, low openness for
experiences predicted greater gains over time, as did high trait anxiety and high sattva propor-
tion at baseline. Moreover, being younger was associated with enhanced decentering. High ab-
sorption predicted decreases in mind-wandering, as did receiving physical yoga. Interestingly,
a longer baseline and high spirituality predicted increased mind-wandering. Negative changes
in well-being were significantly predicted by age, spirituality and total practice time – suggest-
ing that participants who were either younger, low in spirituality, or who practiced less (when
everything else was statistically controlled) improved their well-being more. Also, participants
high in absorption and those who received ethical education in their treatment reported higher
gains in well-being.
There were no significant predictors of changes in attention, body awareness, emotion
regulation, self-reflection, stress or valence. However, as our analysis is exploratory in nature,
we also inspected effect sizes that were relatively large and significant on a 10%-level. In this
respect, participants high in agreeableness and low in neuroticism and openness improved
their attention skills more. Similarly, arousal decreased more for participants who were
younger, high in need for cognition or low in sattva proportion. High absorption might be a
potentially meaningful predictor of enhanced body awareness. Other potentially relevant pre-
dictors of enhanced decentering skills were high absorption, low spirituality, low conscien-
tiousness and being female. High trait anxiety and low self-compassion predicted improve-
ments in emotion regulation. Low agreeableness and receiving ethical education were associ-
ated with higher valence. Finally, we examined whether personality could predict the total ef-
fect of the intervention, but found no significant predictors. The total variance explained by
each model ranged from .20 (stress) to .72 (emotion regulation).
In sum, high absorption, high anxiety, low spirituality, low openness and younger age
seemed to be positive predictors of multiple outcome variables. Regarding the treatment com-
ponents, ethical education reliably predicted enhanced well-being while physical yoga led to
reduced mind-wandering.

Discussion
This single-case, multiple baseline study examined the effects of four different eight-
week MBM interventions, based on MBLM, on a number of dependent variables to answer the
question of who benefits most from what type of treatment. Thereby, we investigated which
personality traits may moderate and predict the outcomes of these four MBM treatments.
While high anxiety, high absorption, low spirituality, low openness, and younger age predicted
stronger effects in a range of positive outcomes, other traits had a more differential impact.
Likewise, effects differed depending on the treatment components participants completed. Re-
ceiving ethical education improved well-being, and engaging in physical yoga reduced mind-
wandering – suggesting possible indications for future research and practice. Similarly, in the
cluster analysis, we found that participants with a more maladaptive personality structure
(among others: higher anxiety and lower life satisfaction) enhanced their emotion regulation

skills more. These results allowed us to address the question of “who benefits most” from three
different perspectives.

and decentering as well as decreased mind-wandering. Several studies indicate that high trait
absorption is related to both greater meditation depth (Hölzel & Ott, 2006) and intense spir-
itual experiences (Lifshitz et al., 2019). Likewise, experienced meditators score higher on trait
absorption (Berkovich-Ohana & Glicksohn, 2017). However, it remains unclear whether this is
the result of self-selection or whether practice of continuous meditation enhanced this trait, or
both. In our study, absorption correlated with reported mean meditation ease (r = .38) and
mean meditation duration (r = .50). This implies that participants high in absorption medi-
tated more frequently and with more effortlessness, which might have increased motivation
and effectivity.
Surprisingly, participants low in openness or spirituality experienced more positive ef-
fects, such as increased decentering, or increased well-being and decreased mind-wandering,
respectively. In contrast, in earlier studies, higher openness was associated with better out-
come of MBM interventions (Krick & Felfe, 2020), and greater engagement in MBM activities
at home (Barkan et al., 2016). Likewise, spirituality or spiritual experiences moderated positive
MBM intervention outcomes (Greeson et al., 2015; Ratcliff et al., 2021), and openness and
spirituality were positively related to psychological well-being (Unterrainer et al., 2010). Thus,
our findings seem somewhat counter-intuitive. One explanation might be a ceiling effect,
where there might have been little room for improvement for those already very high on those
traits. This might also explain why participants high in anxiety benefitted more regarding their
decentering abilities, or why those low in life satisfaction exhibited a greater reduction in
arousal. Furthermore, this corresponds with the results of our cluster analysis (see discussion
below). However, there might also be other possible explanations for these findings that we are
currently unaware of and that require further investigation.

Younger age was associated with higher decentering and well-being over the course of
the treatment, the former also being true for participants high in sattva (i.e., a more balanced
personality). These factors might have made it easier to accommodate changes throughout the
intervention and establish a practice routine. A large survey study reported that middle aged
and older adults had higher levels of decentering than younger ones (Naragon-Gainey et al.,
2020), suggesting younger adults might have more room for improvement in this respect. In-
terestingly, participants who practiced less enhanced their well-being more, supporting a pre-
viously reported lack of significant dose-response relationships in mindfulness-based pro-
grams (Strohmaier, 2020). Surprisingly, a longer baseline period predicted higher mind-wan-
dering. This might have been due to the extensive study period or might represent a methodo-
logical artefact. Moreover, high extraversion led to increased arousal over time. There have
been mixed findings regarding the moderating role of extraversion on MBM intervention out-
comes (Kobylińska et al., 2018; Nyklíček & Irrmischer, 2017). Extraversion is robustly associ-
ated with positive affect; however, Smillie et al. (2015) showed that this positive affect could
best be conceptualised as a combination of positive valence and high activation/arousal.
Hence, an increase in arousal might essentially represent a positive effect for extraverted par-
ticipants.
Certain components of MBM treatments can have differential effects and indica-
tions
Ethical education reliably predicted improved well-being – even after controlling for a
whole range of personality traits. This supports our previously reported findings on the bene-
ficial effects of ethical education (Matko, Sedlmeier, et al., 2021a). The ethical education com-
ponent invited participants to explore their personal values and habits, nudging them to make
adaptive choices and changes in personal lifestyle. Acting in accordance with personal values
has positive effects on well-being and quality of life (Franquesa et al., 2017). Furthermore, it is
increasingly being acknowledged in psychotherapy and psychiatry, for example, in acceptance
and commitment therapy (Hayes et al., 2011).

Physical yoga, on the other hand, led to reduced mind-wandering. Contemporary yoga
theories often attribute a reduction in mind-wandering to the meditation component of tradi-
tional yoga (Gard et al., 2014; Schmalzl et al., 2015). However, in our study, participants in all
conditions practiced meditation, and only the added physical yoga component markedly de-
creased mind-wandering. Surprisingly, there is little research on physical yoga’s impact on
mind-wandering, in contrast to meditation research (Brandmeyer & Delorme, 2020). A recent
study indicated that physical yoga reduced mind-wandering and this effect was amplified by
additional yoga breathing practice (Saoji et al., 2018). The physical yoga component of this
study integrated yoga postures and simple breathing practice, which might have enhanced its
effects. In addition, mind-wandering and mindfulness were shown to be inversely related, rep-
resenting opposite sides of the same coin (Mrazek et al., 2012). Fittingly, increased mindful-
ness has been proposed as a central mechanism of yoga’s effectiveness on stress and general
health (Riley & Park, 2015; Tellhed et al., 2019).
These findings could guide personalised recommendations regarding the targeted im-
plementation of MBM interventions. Physicians expressed a high interest in implementing and
recommending MBM interventions, but reported sizeable barriers, such as lack of training,
expertise or clinic time (Sierpina et al., 2007). Excessive mind-wandering, for example, has
been linked to several psychological disorders, such as depression or anxiety (Chaieb et al.,
2022). Our findings indicate that a combination of yoga postures, breathing practice and med-
itation might be particularly helpful in these circumstances. People or patients interested in
enhancing their well-being, on the other hand, could be advised to practice meditation and
engage in ethical education.
Vulnerable populations might benefit more than healthy populations
Our results imply a specifically large increase in emotion regulation skills for those par-
ticipants with a less favourable personality profile. Emerging evidence suggests that individu-
als who are more at risk benefit more from emotion regulation interventions (Smyth & Arigo,
2009). Furthermore, a recent study found that a mindfulness intervention was more effective
for those patients with an earlier onset of depression, higher levels of rumination and a lower
WHO BENEFITS MOST? PERSONALITY, YOGA AND MEDITATION 22
quality of life (Ter Avest et al., 2019). Similar results were obtained for healthy participants
with higher levels of neuroticism (de Vibe et al., 2015; Nyklíček & Irrmischer, 2017) or stress
(Braun et al., 2019). Hence, it seems that vulnerable participants might benefit more from di-
verse MBM interventions. Interestingly, this pattern was found in each MBM treatment. In an
earlier publication, we reported similarly positive effects for all four MBM treatments on emo-
tion regulation (Matko, Sedlmeier, et al., 2021b). Although almost all participants improved
their emotion regulation skills, those with higher anxiety and neuroticism and lower life satis-
faction and self-compassion improved more. The reasons for this might be a stronger motiva-
tion or a higher potential for improvement. Another potential explanation could be a regres-
sion to the mean or a spontaneous remission for those participants that experienced more dif-
ficulties. However, this might be unlikely, as in outpatients with clinical depression, MBLM
turned out to be more effective than treatment as usual (Bringmann et al., 2022).
From a clinical perspective, this might imply that MBM treatments should be recom-
mended for those seeking to enhance their emotion regulatory skills, especially those with
more maladaptive traits. Given that emotion regulation difficulties are at the core of various
forms of psychopathology (Gross & Muñoz, 1995), our findings might be of particular im-
portance in this regard.
Limitations
This study provides interesting and multi-layered insights into the question “Who ben-
efits most from what type of MBM treatment?”. It employed a rigorous experimental single-
case study design capturing a wide range of dependent and independent variables. Neverthe-
less, it has some limitations, too. In single-case research, a sample of 42 participants is consid-
ered exceptionally large. However, the sample size is somewhat small regarding personality
effects and subgroup comparisons. Therefore, we coerced the four conditions into larger anal-
ysis units and performed regression and cluster analysis across all participants. With up to 85
measurements per participant for daily measures, the effect size estimates of the dependent
variables should be very robust. Still, personality research usually acquires much larger sam-
ples to rule out incidental findings and increase reliability. If one only looks at the significant
WHO BENEFITS MOST? PERSONALITY, YOGA AND MEDITATION 23
results of the regression analyses, one might argue that their number is not much higher than
the one to be expected by Type-1 error. However, due to the relatively small sample size (which
was extremely large for single-case research), only relatively large effects reached the 5% limit.
Therefore, we reported some non-significant, but relatively high betas in our regression anal-
yses, which might reach significance in larger samples. It would, thus, be advisable to repeat
this study with a conventional design and a larger sample size.
In addition, it would be interesting to compare the responses of healthy participants to
those of at-risk or clinical populations. This could be done to further investigate the notion that
more vulnerable participants exhibit stronger effects. Furthermore, the conditions could be
further adjusted to create comparable session lengths or dismantle the effects of yoga compo-
nents in an even more detailed way. This could mean comparing treatments incorporating only
ethics, only physical postures, only breathing techniques, or only meditation to diverse combi-
nations of these. Moreover, future studies should include measures of motivation and individ-
ual preference as these can strongly impact a treatment’s outcome (Carlson et al., 2014). Like-
weise, they could conduct qualitative interviews regarding the experiences of the individual
participant to better understand how individuals respond to MBM treatments.
Future directions
While patient preference is at the forefront of the decision to carry out yoga or not,
individualised selection and adaptation to symptomatology and personality traits has hardly
been done so far, and the evidence is insufficient. The very heterogeneous and contradictory
results are possibly due to the so far undifferentiated indication. A look at the more recent
developments in psychotherapy shows that here, too, against the background of high propor-
tions of non-responders and a stagnation of effectiveness despite constant further develop-
ments, a shift to an individualised indication based on biopsychosocial patient characteristics
is called for (Brakemeier & Herpertz, 2019). Also, in the application of complementary medi-
cine, the identification of traits that better predict a therapy response and allow a targeted in-
dication is necessary. Our study contributes to this and provides evidence that allows an indi-
vidualised prescription of yoga and meditation. Overall, our results showed that participants

differ in their response to MBM interventions and that the personality structure and desired
skills/goals of people interested in MBM practices can be taken into account. This could sup-
port the development of tailored MBM interventions and, in the future, help clinicians to make
scientifically sound recommendations for their patients in terms of personalised medicine for
optimal healthcare.
