VACCINATION, BELIEF AND RISK 2
Abstract
To reduce transmission of COVID-19, public mandates recommended or required minimum
physical distancing between individuals, in addition to the use of vaccine rollouts as a
public health measure. When individuals are faced with multiple risk reducing behaviours,
they may engage in risk compensation. In an online natural experiment, risk compensation
was investigated during the COVID-19 pandemic to examine whether vaccination and
beliefs in vaccine eﬀicacy reduced physical distancing. Participants completed a distance
matching task, where they position avatars of themselves in hypothetical stylized images of
everyday scenarios in a 2 (location) x 3 (activity) factorial design. Consistent with risk
compensation; the idea that in the presence of multiple risk-reducing behavioural
interventions, individuals may choose less stringent behavioural change of one sort, if they
benefit of another form of risk-reduction; this study finds that individuals are more willing
to stand closer to strangers when fully vaccinated as vaccine beliefs grow. Furthermore,
such behaviours do not mitigate when controlling for perceived risk of a
COVID-19infection or hospitalisation. A similar finding is observed for vaccine intentions
as well as a difference between revealed and stated preferences of risk when comparing
across vaccine manufacturers. These results suggest that though vaccines can be effective
as a public health measure, the act of being vaccinated may lead to risk compensation that
could lead to additional waves from mutations of any such public health crisis.

Risk compensation: how vaccination impacts social distancing in an online natural
experiment
1 Introduction
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of the world implemented policies to
reduce transmission, to reduce the impact on health systems and vulnerable segments of
the population such as the elderly or immunocompromised (Kadambari, Klenerman, &
Pollard, 2020; Mikolai, Keenan, & Kulu, 2020; Rout, 2020). Though there were some
variations in policy implementation, the central tenant was to delay the impact of the virus
until a vaccine programme could be implemented under a mass immunisation approach
(Kissler, Tedijanto, Goldstein, Grad, & Lipsitch, 2020; Riel & Wit, 2020). The most
common policies to achieve this was through social distancing and mask usage. These
policies were based on empirical evidence that demonstrates how presenting new
information and by changing circumstances and perceptions of risk can lead to changes in
behaviour (Gaube, Lermer, & Fischer, 2019; Wise, Zbozinek, Michelini, Hagan, & Mobbs,
2020). Many governments around the world encouraged individuals to work from home and
to reduce social gatherings by closing pubs restaurants and suggesting a physical distance
between individuals (often at 2 meters), when interacting with others out of the home.
Mask usage became increasingly common throughout the world, much of east Asia the use
of face masks was widespread from early in the pandemic, due primarily to public policy,
cultural norms and experiences with similar epidemics such as SARS. However, in the
United Kingdom for instance, mask use was mandated from 15 June 2020 and primarily in
public settings such as public transport or when entering stores.
Much of the public policy space surrounding preventative measures, was enacted to
allow time for vaccine programs to implemented. When available countries opted to push
for mass immunisation as a public health measure to counter the spread of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus (Grabenstein & Nevin, 2006), public health oﬀicials believed once
available the public would take up the vaccine, however issues around vaccine hesitancy
VACCINATION, BELIEF AND RISK 4
reduced uptake rates (Murphy et al., 2021; Soares et al., 2021; Vergara, Sarmiento, &
Lagman, 2021). Issues around vaccine hesitancy led some countries to enforce a vaccine
mandate to the general public, such as Austria, Indonesia and Ecuador, with some
countries mandating specific populations such as healthcare employees in Australia, Great
Britain, France and Germany (Mumcuoglu, Mackos, & Vardon, 2021). Furthermore, some
countries mandated the use of a vaccine certificate to confirm vaccination status.
The vaccines were initially shown to be effective in reducing the risk of acquiring a
COVID-19 infection or being hospitalised as a result of infection for PfizerBioNTech,
Oxford/AstraZeneca, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine (Pilishvili et al., 2021;
Sadoff et al., 2021; Voysey et al., 2021). However, in the wake of mutant strains of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus, the vaccine eﬀicacy was called into question. For example, vaccine
eﬀicacy was shown drop in the arrival of the Delta variant, observed initially in India but
became the dominant global strain (Agency, 2022). Empirical research demonstrated that
vaccinated individuals with the Delta variant showed similar viral loads as unvaccinated
individuals (Riemersma et al., 2022). In late 2021 and early 2022, the emergence of the
Omnicron variant strain demonstrated a serious issue for the United Kingdom as a third
wave of COVID cases threatened the public health system (Burki, 2022). Vaccine eﬀicacy
for individuals who completed the original course was estimated to retain 36% effectiveness
up to 60 days, dropping to 1% after 180 days (Buchan et al., 2022).
As mutations to the COVID-19 virus reduced the vaccine eﬀicacy rates, this led to
pressures on alternative public health measures (including but not limited to social
distancing, isolation, contact tracing and mask usage). The interaction of a combination of
these measures may have lead people to demonstrate a concept known as risk
compensation (Hedlund, 2000; Peltzman, 1975; Underhill, 2013). Risk compensation occurs
when an individual changes their behaviour in response to a perceived lowering of risk that
occurred through other means. As a result, this new behavior increases the overall risk to
the individual and those they feels directly responsible for. There are multiple explanations
VACCINATION, BELIEF AND RISK 5
of risk compensation offered in the literature, for example from an economic perspective
safety is balanced against other needs, such as time or happiness (Peltzman, 1975). Other
alternative explanations stem from the social amplification of risk framework (SARF)
(Kasperson et al., 1988). SARF suggests that risk perception can be amplified or
attenuated through signals both processed and transmitted by individuals and social
entities. These signals create behavioural responses that can result in secondary impacts or
ripples (Kasperson, Webler, Ram, & Sutton, 2022). Risk compensation may arise as a
result of competing signals of risk, where one is attenuated and another amplified. As a
direct consequence of modulated risk perception, individuals may change their behaviour
as a consequence of the modulation of risk.
Risk compensation has been empirically investigated in numerous contexts such as
wearing seatbelts (Evans & Graham, 1991; Peltzman, 1975); road lighting (Assum,
Bjørnskau, Fosser, & Sagberg, 1999); helmets (Radun, Radun, Esmaeilikia, & Lajunen,
2018; Ruedl, Abart, Ledochowski, Burtscher, & Kopp, 2012); HIV prevention (Eaton &
Kalichman, 2007; Marcus et al., 2013; Underhill, 2013) as well as contraception (Shukla,
Pullabhotla, & Arends-Kuenning, 2021). Risk compensation has been empirically
investigated through a variety of methods, such as laboratory experiments (Phillips, Fyhri,
& Sagberg, 2011; Streff & Geller, 1988), natural experiment settings (Assum et al., 1999;
Radun et al., 2018); as well as regression analysis (Evans & Graham, 1991; Marlow,
Forster, Wardle, & Waller, 2009) and randomised controlled trials (Marcus et al., 2013).
The empirical research conducted on risk compensation show that it is not a universal
phenomenon, and may be dependent on various contextual factors such as the intervention
function and approach and the behaviours being measures.
In the case of risk compensation in the context of COVID-19, the literature has mixed
reviews and evidence. Risk compensation has been identified in mask use, for example,
Luckman et al. (2021) demonstrated evidence in favour of risk compensation for mask use
in social distancing in a lab experiment (Luckman et al., 2021); furthermore this finding
VACCINATION, BELIEF AND RISK 6
was corroborated by a Yan, Bayham, Richter, and Fenichel (2021) who examined Safegraph
data showed that people avoid staying at home in states with mask mandates compared to
more liberal states. There is some marginal evidence supporting risk compensation from
vaccination based on mathematical models, and the effects can be more pronounced if the
vaccine eﬀicacy is reduced (Ioannidis, 2021). Furthermore, many researchers have put
forward risk compensation as a factor in the waves of the COVID-19 pandemic (Iyengar,
Nune, & Botchu, 2022; Mantzari, Rubin, & Marteau, 2020). However empirical results
remain mixed, with one study in Taiwan suggesting that vaccinated healthworkers do not
engage in risk compensation (Sun et al., 2022), however they operationalise their behaviour
with regards to health behaviours (e.g. hand washing). However a study by Buckell et al.
(2021), demonstrated evidence of risk compensation across the UK when analysing the
Oﬀice for National Statistics (ONS) COVID-19 Infection Survey (CIS).
Theoretical understanding of risk are thought be domain and behaviour specific, such
that risk in one domain may not be perceived in another. For example, when faced with
the same probabilistic outcomes framed as a loss people exhibit risk seeking behaviour, but
when framed as a gain show risk-averse behaviour (Kahneman & Tversky, 2013). In the
context of COVID-19, the function of vaccinations is to reduce the risk of virility, this
reduction is risk may compete against the increased risk as a consequence of the degree
with compliance to social distancing. As vaccines do not prevent the individual from
carrying the virus, they may still be susceptible to the virus in close proximity.
To investigate this hypothesis, an online natural experiment was ran recruiting
individuals from the United States to take part in a distance preference task. In this study,
I examine social distancing in a distance preference task, evaluating population differences
between vaccine status in conjunction with demographic factors and strength of belief in
the vaccine as well as perceived risk. An online distance matching task was used as a
behavioural task to assess social distancing judgements, as this was a convenient method
being fairly inexpensive to utilise. Furthermore, estimates of distance in digital spaces have
VACCINATION, BELIEF AND RISK 7
been shown to scale as shown in distance tasks in virtual reality and online settings
Surtees, Apperly, & Samson (2013). Online tasks demonstrate validity of distance where
individuals scale distances as a representative of their field of view in exocentric views, in
which the participants are not immersed in the environment but viewing externally Morar,
Macredie, & Cribbin (2002). For example Feldstein et al. (2020) found no difference
between real and virtual distance judgements, with greater levels of feedback across
dimensions increased the accuracy of virtual judgements. Furthermore, these measures are
sensitive to detect differences between populations, such as by Welsch, Hecht, Kolar,
Witthöft, and Legenbauer (2020) investigated how participants distanced themselves in the
context of interpersonal distancing using online avatars.
This study aims to investigate the following pre-registered hypothesis in reference to
risk compensation as a consequence of the COVID-19 vaccines:
𝐻 : Vaccinated individuals will be willing to position themselves closer to others in social
situations.
𝐻 & 𝐻 : It is expected that partially vaccinated (𝐻 ) and fully vaccinated (𝐻 )

COVID-19 or risk of hospitalisation (respectively).
𝐻 : Furthermore, location may affect risk compensation behaviours, where individuals will

𝐻 : Unvaccinated individuals with a vaccine appointment are more likely to position
themselves closer to others in social situations than unvaccinated individuals without an

2 Method
2.1 Participants and Exclusions
were paid 0.70c to complete the experiment (at a rate of $8.40/hour). Inclusion criteria
were as follows:
• Citizen of the United States
• Over the age of 18
• Prolific user
• Normal or corrected-to-normal vision
Using vaccination uptake data from the Centre for Disease Control (Centre for
Disease Control, 2021), it was expexted that around 55.3% of participants would have
recieved at least one vaccine dose, and approximately 44% would be fully vaccinated.
Based on the above assumptions, it was estimated that the sample would contain
approximately 340 unvaccinated individuals, 86 partially vaccinated individuals and 334
fully vaccinated individuals. Participants were asked to self-report theirvaccine status as no
pre-screening criteria existed to stratify on Prolific at the time of data collection. Amongst
the sample population, 61 self reported as being unvaccinated, 178 as partially vaccinated
and 517 as fully vaccinated, this distribution was statistically significantly different from
what the CDC reported, 𝜒(2) = 92.86, p < .001.
Monte Carlo simulations were ran, using 1000 trials, to calculate statistical power for
recovered effect sizes, assuming the following parameters: fully vaccinated individuals
socially distance on average 1.75m (SD = 1.0m), partially vaccinated distance on average
1.88m (SD = 1.0m) with unvaccinated individuals distancing 2.0m (SD = 1.0m), which

would translate to an anticipated difference of 0.25 standardized units between fully
vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. For the expected distribution of vaccine statuses
the simulation obtained a mean effect size 𝜂 = 0.02 with statistical power of 82.70%;
however with the same assumptions, the observed distribution of vaccine statuses
demonstrated a mean effect size of 𝜂 = 0.01 and a statistical power of 73.60%. Estimates
of effect sizes and statistical power were calculated using the effectsize (Ben-Shachar,
Lüdecke, & Makowski, 2020) and the pwr packages (Champely, 2020).
2.2 Procedure
The primary task participants completed was a social distancing task using a subset of
trials from Luckman et al. (2021). This study differs from Luckman et al. (2021) by the
following parameters, only the non-masked stranger trials are used, and participants are not
informed of the stranger’s vaccination status. Furthermore, as this is a natural experiment,
participants are also not randomized to their given variable of interest, vaccine status.
Participants placed an avatar of themselves to indicate the closest distance they
would be willing to position themselves from another person (described as a stranger) in
six different scenarios. These scenarios differed in terms of their location (inside or outside)
and in the activity taking place (sitting, walking or standing). Each participant saw all
combinations of the 2 (location) x 3 (activity) variations but in a random order to
eliminate order effects, with each scenario being presented as a separate trial, with a
written description and stylized image for each unique setting. Participants indicated on
VACCINATION, BELIEF AND RISK 10
the image the closest they would be willing to sit, stand or walk to the stranger in each
respective scenario. A validation item was implemented by asking participants the purpose
of the distance matching task, participants who selected any other response than “the
closest they would be willing to sit, stand or walk to the other person” was considered
incorrect, these participants were removed from the main analysis.
In each scenario participants were shown an image of the activity and location, with
a stranger positioned in a unique setting. As the participant moved their mouse over the
placed in the setting. When the participant clicked on the image, a green box would
appear indicating their chosen social distancing preference which was submitted by clicking
the ‘Next’ arrow button. The avatar could be repositioned by clicking on the previous
selected box and then clicking elsewhere. In each trial, there were 17 different locations in
which the avatar could be placed, during the instructions and prior to the first scenario,
participants were informed that the figures represented adults of approximately 1.7m in
height. Based on the 17 available positions and the scaling of the avatars, each position
mapped to distances roughly between 0 and 4m in 0.25m intervals, however participants
were not informed of these units.
After participants complete the distance preference task, they are asked to answer a
short survey to understand more about participants (demographic) as well as their vaccine
status, and beliefs about the vaccines and COVID-19 virus. Ethical approval for this study
was granted by the University of Warwick’s Decision Research at Warwick committee
(HSSREC: 75/20-21).
2.3 Measures
The primary outcome measure is closest individuals would be willing to socially distance
themselves from a stranger in the above six scenarios. In addition, data is collected about
participant’s current vaccine status (fully, partially or unvaccinated), their belief of the

vaccine’s protective and preventative effects, as well as data on their belief of acquiring a
COVID-19 infection as well as hospitalisation as a result of a COVID-19 infection.
Furthermore, additional data is also collected on demographic information such as age,
gender, state residence, employment status and whether they work in the healthcare
setting. Participants are asked to provide subjective judgements of vaccine status
distributions (out of 10 people how many are unvaccinated, partially and fully vaccinated).
Further data on unvaccinated individuals s also collected on vaccine intention and any
upcoming vaccine appointments.
2.4 Analysis
This experiment tested how receiving a COVID-19 vaccine and the belief in the vaccine’s
protective characteristics, as well as the location of an encounter (inside or outside) might
affect the distance people would keep from a stranger for three different activities
(standing, sitting and walking). These activities were selected as representative of
VACCINATION, BELIEF AND RISK 12
situations individuals would likely encounter with a stranger. Mixed effects models were
fitted to evaluate social distancing across different activities, however there are some
additional non pre-registered speculations.
The analytical model was modified due to overfitting of the random-effects, as a
result, activity and location were only entered as fixed-effects as there are only one trial for
each combination of activity with location. To allow for interpretability, vaccine belief was
centred. The model specification used for the main analysis is as follows:
𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 , = 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 + 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑠 ∗ 𝐵𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑓 + 𝐿𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 , ∗𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦 , +(1|𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑗𝐼 𝐷 ) + 𝜖 + 𝜆

Where Control is a vector of control variables including age, sex, state residence,
employment status, healthcare worker status. Status denotes a self reported variable of
whether the individual has received no vaccinations (unvaccinated), one of two vaccine
dosages (partially vaccinated), one of one alternatively two of two vaccine dosages (fully
vaccinated). Belief denotes the computed aggregate belief score regarding the protection of
catching and spreading COVID-19, these are then computed to a single score by averaging
across both vectors. Location and Activity denote the trial contexts, in a 2 x 3 factorial

3.1 Sample breakdown
760 participants were recruited from the Prolific platform on the 3rd and 4th July 2021. In
line with the preregistered criteria, 92 participants were excluded from the analysis for
failing the check question (removal of these participants does not impact the overall
results). The final sample consisted of 668 (316 Females; 47.31%; 𝑀 = 34.29, 𝑆𝐷 =

To investigate risk compensation, the distance individuals position themselves relative
to the stranger is understood as the minimum they would be willing to socially distance, as
measured in meters (in discrete 0.25m units). This study examines how social distancing is
affected by whether an individual is vaccinated, and the degree to which they believe in the
COVID-19 vaccines, a primary function of risk compensation (Hedlund, 2000).

3.2 Location and activity
As preregistered, a mixed-effect linear model was conducted using the afex package
(Singmann, Bolker, Westfall, Aust, & Ben-Shachar, 2022) to evaluate the extent to which
people socially distanced across different activities and locations. There was a significant
effect of location (F(5, 559) = 3.05, p = 0.01), where people are more more willing to social
distance indoors (M = 1.79m, SE = 0.10m) than outside (M = 1.71m, SE = 0.10m)
regardless of activity, demonstrating evidence in favour of 𝐻 .
Furthermore differences between activities were explored by comparing sitting,
standing and walking using pairwise comparisons. In accordance with the literature, this
study seeks to determine differences between sitting, standing and walking replicating the
qualitative trends observed by Luckman et al. (2021), where individuals show a preference
for socially distance the most when sitting, socilly distance less when walking than sitting,
and finally willing to socially distance the least when standing. In this model, there is a
significant effect of activity (F(1, 559) = 2.64, p = 0.105), showing that individuals indeed
would prefer to position themselves significantly further when sitting (M = 2.09m, SE =
0.11m) as opposed to standing (M = 1.47m, SE = 0.11m) or walking (M = 1.69m, SE =
0.11m) next to a stranger, t(3100) = 16.32, p < .001. Pairwise comparisons revealed
significant differences between sitting compared to standing or walking (t(3099 = 16.32, p
< .001). Furthermore, this model found that individuals would socially distance more for
walking than they would for standing (t(3099) = -6.20, p < .001). These results are
It is likely that such differences may related to beliefs around tasks, where sitting next to a
stranger is likely a longer interaction than standing which is a longer interaction than
walking.

3.3 Vaccine status and vaccine belief
This model also investigated the effects of vaccine status on social distancing, as well as the
moderating effect of vaccine belief. The model demonstrated no effect of vaccine status
(F(2, 559) = 0.11, p = 0.894), with no significant difference between the average distancing
of fully vaccinated (M = 1.69m, SE = 0.14m), partially vaccinated individuals (M =
1.77m, SE = 0.20m) and unvaccinated individuals (M = 1.70m, SE = 0.15m). These
results do not support 𝐻 or 𝐻 , as fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated and

vaccinated individuals social distance further, however fully vaccinated individuals reduce
social distancing as their belief grows stronger (note: Error bars reflect S.E.M )
that belief in COVID-19 vaccines eﬀicacy moderates the effect of social distance in a
significant interaction between vaccine status and belief in vaccine (F(1, 3110) = 35.25, p <
.001). The results show a negative association between fully vaccinated individuals and
vaccine belief where fully vaccinated participants reduced socially distance less by -0.030m
for each unit increase in vaccine belief. However, partially vaccinated increase distancing
by 0.120m and unvaccinated distance further by 0.102m. Pairwise comparisons of
vaccinated against unvaccinated, revealed significant differences (t (651) = -0.13, p =
0.002), this evidence supports hypothesis 𝐻 .
To highlight such differences a linear plot of vaccine belief against predicted social
VACCINATION, BELIEF AND RISK 17
vaccinated individual with weak beliefs is estimated to stand 2.15m away (95% CI: 1.98m;
2.32m). Partially and unvaccinated individuals with weak beliefs stand closer, with an
partially vaccinated individual is estimated to stand considerably closer, at around 0.68m
(95% CI: 0.26m; 1.10m), and an unvaccinated individual is estimated to stand at 1.11m
(95% CI: 0.98m; 1.24m). However, when estimated social distancing for individuals with
the strongest beliefs in the vaccine a fully vaccinated individual is estimated to stand at
1.89m away (95% CI: 1.83m; 1.95m), where partially and unvaccinated individuals stand
further away, with an partially vaccinated individual is estimated to stand at 2.38m (95%
CI: 2.26m; 2.51m), and an unvaccinated individual is estimated to stand at 2.36m (95% CI:
2.25m; 2.47m).
The population differences may infer different sub-populations where those who hold
strong belief in vaccine eﬀicacy compared to those who hold weak beliefs in the vaccine.
For fully vaccinated individuals these may indicate population of those who received the
vaccine for intentional reasons if they hold high beliefs, whilst opting for the vaccine to
return to normalcy for weak to medium beliefs, which could explain the negative
association of belief and distancing. However for partially vaccinated who hold strong
beliefs may perceive risks of COVID-19 more saliently as their treatment course is not
complete and is due for completion with the next 3-4 weeks. Partially vaccinated who hold
weak to moderate beliefs may also be opting for vaccinations to return to normalcy and
may have held weak or even no intention to get vaccinated. Unvaccinated individuals who
hold strong beliefs in vaccine eﬀicacy may also show a high intentions to get vaccinated,
which may not be said for those with weak to moderate beliefs, who hold no intention to
get vaccinated.
3.4 Vaccine status, vaccine belief and COVID-19 ‘risk beliefs
Initial exploration of subjective risk of acquiring COVID-19 was shown to be non-normally
distributed (skewness = 2.00; kurtosis = 8.11) as was subjective risk of hospitalization from
VACCINATION, BELIEF AND RISK 18
COVID-19 (skewness = 1.81; kurtosis = 5.66). Logarithmic transformations were
conducted which substantially reduced the skewness for subjective risk of acquiring
COVID-19 (skewness = -0.42; kurtosis = 2.61) as was subjective risk of hospitalization
from COVID-19 (skewness = -0.02; kurtosis = 2.01).
To investigate 𝐻 , two additional models were ran which included perceived risk of
acquiring a COVID-19 infection, and the perceived risk of hospitalization from acquiring a
COVID-19 infection. Initial examination of these variables revealed a significant
medium-sized correlation (r = 0.43, p < .001), therefore these factors were entered
separately into two distinct models to account for multicollinearity. In addition, the models
included a fixed-effects factor of a previous COVID-19 infection was a boolean variable
(where 1 denoted known or suspected cases; 0 denoting no infection or was not suspected).
This model replicates the effect of location * activity interaction (F(2, 2930) = 5.25,
p = 0.005). There is no effect of previous COVID infections increasing social distancing
(F(1, 526) = 1.39, p = 0.238), suggesting that any previous cases of COVID-19 does not
increase social distancing.
There is a significant effect of perceived risk of a COVID-19 infection (F(1, 526) =
7.07, p = 0.008), suggesting that there is a positive association between the percentage
change in belief of acquiring a COVID-19 infection and the degree to which individuals are
willing to socially distance. In this model, the interaction for vaccine status and vaccine
belief is still significant identifying that the effect of risk compensation is not reduced when
controlling for perceived risk of COVID-19 (F(2, 526) = 4.17, p = 0.016). Comparisons of
slopes across groups demonstrated a significant difference between Fully Vaccinated and
Unvaccinated individuals (𝛽 = -0.10, p = 0.05), replicating the effects observed in the
that a fully vaccinated individual with weak beliefs would socially distance at around
2.17m away (95% CI: 2.00m; 2.34m), whilst an unvaccinated individual with weak beliefs is
estimated to stand at 1.20m away (95% CI: 1.06m; 1.33m). However when estimating

3.5 Vaccine status, vaccine belief and hospitalisation risk
The third model evaluates the risk compensation effect whilst controlling for the
percieved risk of hospitalisation from a COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 previous
infections. This model replicates the effect of location and activity interaction (F(2, 2930)
= 5.25, p = 0.005). The model does not demonstrate observe any effect of previous COVID
infections increasing social distancing (F(1, 526) = 0.50, p = 0.481), suggesting that any

previous cases of COVID-19 does not increase social distancing.
The results do highlight that individuals are more likely to socially distance if they
believe they are at risk of hospitalisation if they acquire a COVID-19 infection (F(1, 526)
= 16.91, p < .001). This would suggest that as an individuals belief of hospitalization
increases the degree to which they socially distance increases by 0.130m for each
percentage increase in strength of belief for hospitalisation from COVID-19. The model
exhibits however a significant interaction of vaccine status and vaccine belief (F(2, 526) =

3.6 Exploratory Analysis
3.6.1 Regressing vaccine status & social distancing on vaccine belief. To
explore possible explanations of how vaccine beliefs influence social distancing across
vaccine states, a fixed-effects linear regression was conducted, as specified below regressing
vaccine status (interacted with averaged social distancing across all trials) on vaccine
beliefs, with a vector of control variables. To correct for heteroskedasticity, White’s robust
standard errors are computed using the vcovHC function of the sandwich package (Zeileis,
2006).
𝐵𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑓 = 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 + 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑠 ∗ 𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 + 𝜖
𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖
𝜖 ∼ 𝑁 (𝜇, 𝜎)
The linear fixed-effects model demonstrates population differences vaccine belief,
unvaccinated individuals were shown to hold significantly weaker beliefs than fully
vaccinated individuals (𝛽 = 0.55, p < .001); partially vaccinated were also shown to hold
significantly weaker belifs than fully vaccinated individuals (𝛽 = 0.83, p = 0.067). Fully
vaccinated individuals were shown strongest belief in the vaccine (M = 7.20; SE = 0.21);
followed by partially vaccinated individuald (M = 7.03; SE = 0.36) and finally
unvaccinated individuals (M = 5.20; SE = 0.24). A post-hoc contrast demonstrated that
partially vaccinated individuals hold stronger beliefs than weaker vaccinated individuals (𝛽
= 1.83, p < .001). These results describe population differences in beliefs of vaccine eﬀicacy
which may play a further role in how vaccine beliefs influence risk compensatory
behaviours. As these are population differences it should be noted that these demonstrate
correlations and not causal relationships.
The interaction effects were also shown to be significant, where the relationship for
vaccine belief eﬀicacy and social distancing increased for unvaccinated (M = 0.96; SE =
0.16) and partially vaccinated individuals (M = 0.56; SE = 0.38). However a negative
association was shown between vaccine belief eﬀicacy and social distancing unvaccinated
VACCINATION, BELIEF AND RISK 22
(M = -0.14; SE = 0.11). These results would suggest that as individuals propensity for
social distancing increases, they are more likely to hold stronger vaccine beliefs if partially
or unvaccinated. However, fully vaccinated individuals demonstrate little change in their
vaccine belief as they vary in social distancing. These results show that the interaction is
significant for Unvaccinated individuals (𝛽 = 0.96, p < .001); however the interaction effect
was not significant for partially vaccinated (𝛽 = 0.56, p = 0.143) or fully vaccinated
individuals (𝛽 = -0.14, p = 0.18).
3.6.2 Regressing vaccine status & social distancing on COVID-19 risk
belief. To explore possible explanations of how COVID-19 risk beliefs influence social
distancing across vaccine states, a fixed-effects linear regression was conducted, as specified
below regressing vaccine status (interacted with averaged social distancing across all trials)
on log-transformed COVID-19 risk beliefs, with a vector of control variables. To correct for
heteroskedasticity, White’s robust standard errors are computed using the vcovHC function
of the sandwich package (Zeileis, 2006).

𝜖 ∼ 𝑁 (𝜇, 𝜎)
The fixed-effects model shows a significant effect of social distancing (𝛽 = 0.13, p =
0.022), where higher risk beliefs are associated with increased distancing. The model
demonstrates an effect of vaccine status on risk beliefs, there is a significant difference
between partial and fully vaccinated risk perceptions (𝛽 = 1.24, p = 0.009). However, there
is no difference between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals (𝛽 = -0.17, p =
0.534). Estimated marginal means shows that partially vaccinated individuals hold the
highest risk perception (M = 2.77%; SE = 0.20), followed by unvaccinated individuals (M
= 2.37%; SE = 0.13) and lastly fully vaccinated individuals (M = 2.25%; SE = 0.11).
Interaction effects of vaccine status and averaged social distancing are not significant which
would suggest there is no moderation effect for social distancing on risk perception for
different vaccine statuses (p < .05).
VACCINATION, BELIEF AND RISK 23
3.6.3 Intention to vaccinate. Further exploratory analysis is conducted to
explore subgroup analysis of unvaccinated individuals, to examine whether belief in the
vaccine is motivated through other rationale (political) which may be an extraneous factor.
To investigate this, exploratory analysis was conducted on whether vaccine intentions have
any effect of social distancing. An additional analysis was conducted on the effect of
upcoming vaccination appointments on social distancing.
To investigate, the following model was fitted to the subset of sample who self-report
as unvaccinated.

Where “Intent” refers to either intention to get vaccinated or an upcoming vaccine
appointment as a boolean variable; Control denotes a vector of control variables (age, sex,
hospital employment, state, ethnicity, employment).
When modelling the effects of vaccine intentions, there is a no effect of vaccine
intentions (F(1, 101) = 1.92, p = 0.168). The model demonstrated an effect from vaccine
belief, where individuals who hold stronger beliefs demonstrate a greater liklihood to
socially distance (F(1, 101) = 0.26, p = 0.61), where for every one unit increase in belief,
unvaccinated individuals are willing to stand 0.233m further.
There was a significant interaction effect between vaccine intentions and vaccine
beliefs, (F(1, 101) = 6.03, p = 0.016), where individuals intending to vaccinate socially
distance 0.0542m less for every one unit increase in belief (t(102) = -0.19, p = 0.016). To
visualise such effects predicted distance values were plotted across activities against the

vaccine (i.e. individuals who do not intend to get vaccinated do not percieve the vaccine as

individuals with no vaccine intention socially distance further, whilst indiviuals with an

To explore this assumption further an additional fixed-effects regression was ran
regressing COVID-19 risk beliefs of acquiring an infection on vaccine intention interacted
with vaccine belief, including the vector of control variables with location and activity as
fixed effect terms. This model reveals a significant difference between vaccine intentions (𝛽

to get vaccinated hold their probability judgements lower at 24.26% (95% CI: 21.75; 26.77).
There is only a marginal effect for the interaction of vaccine intentions and vaccine belief
VACCINATION, BELIEF AND RISK 25
(𝛽 = 0.92, p = 0.072).
3.6.4 Effect of vaccine appointment. When exploring the impact of vaccine
appointment on social distancing a fixed-effects linear model was conducted given the
limited sample size of unvaccinated participants and likelihood of a participant having an
upcoming appointment. The model revealed a significant effect of age (𝛽 = -0.02, p <
.001), with older participants less likely to socially distance.
Post-hoc comparisons revealed the same pattern of ordering os observed previously.
Sitting is associated with the greatest social distancing (M = 2.54m, SE = 0.259)
compared to walking (M = 2.09, SE = 0.259) or standing (M = 1.91, SE = 0.259) (p <
.001 respectively). With walking showing greater distancing than standing (t (835) =
-9.376, p < .001). There is also an effect of sex (𝛽 = -0.20, p = 0.012), with females
showing they are more likely to socially distance than males. There was an effect of vaccine
appointments (𝛽 = 0.47, p < .001), with individuals who hold appointments estimated to
position themselves at 2.39m (95% CI: 2.00m; 2.78m), whilst individuals who dont have
appointments stand closer 1.79m (95% CI: 1.63m; 1.94m). These results are in direct
contrast fo 𝐻 , this may be due to an association of having booked/accepted a vaccine
@ref{mod6}.
3.6.5 Judgements on vaccine status distributions. Exploratory analysis
examines the perceived distribution of vaccine status, i.e. the percentage of people
participants believe are unvaccinated, partially or fully vaccinated. To investigate, linear
fixed effect models were conducted with the following specification:
𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 + 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑠 ∗ 𝐵𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑓 + (1|𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑗𝐼 𝐷 ) + 𝜖 𝜖 ∼ 𝑁 (𝜇, 𝜎)

Where Outcome denotes subjective distribution of either fully vaccinated, partially
vaccinated or unvaccinated, with Vaccine Status denoting whether participant is fully
vaccinated, partially vaccinated or unvaccinated. To correct for heterskedasticity, White’s

robust standard errors are computed using the vcovHC function of the sandwich package
(Zeileis, 2006).
Across the three models there is a significant effect of healthcare worker status (p <
.001), where healthcare workers hold lower judgements for fully vaccinated (M = %; SE =
1.17) and higher judgements for partially (M = %; SE = 0.90) and unvaccinated (M = %;
SE = 1.13) compared to non-healthcare workers. The model also demonstrates find a
consistent effect of Asian and Black or African American ethnicities (p < .001), where
Asian participants hold greater estimates for fully vaccinated (M = 40.56%; SE = 0.94)
and partially vaccinated (M = 25.82%; SE = 0.94), with lower judgements for unvaccinated
populations (M = 40.56%; SE = 0.94)in comparison to White Americans; conversely Black
VACCINATION, BELIEF AND RISK 27
and African Americans tend to underestimate fully vaccinated (M = 31.54%; SE = 1.01),
but have greater estimates for partially (M = 27.88%; SE = 1.01) and unvaccinated
populations (M = 40.58%; SE = 1.01) in comparison to White Americans. White
Americans were shown to estimate M = 36.32% (SE = 0.73) of the population to be fully
vaccinated; M = 25.18% (SE = 0.56) of the population to be partially vaccinated; and
38.50% (SE = 0.70) of the population to be unvaccinated. The model also reveals a
significant effect of vaccine belief, where individuals who hold stronger beliefs estimate
greater fully vaccinated populations (𝛽 = 1.44, p = 1.437). Yet stronger held vaccine belief
negatively predicted the judgements for partially vaccinated (𝛽 = -0.54, p < .001) and
unvaccinated (𝛽 = -0.90, p < .001) populations.
When evaluating the effects of vaccine status on perceived distributions of vaccinates,
there is evidence in favour of egocentric mechanism influencing distribution judgements,
wherein individuals hold their own vaccine status as the most probable. This is best shown
vaccinated held the highest judgements (M = 42.61%; SE = 0.92), with partially
vaccinated individuals (M = 34.57%; SE = 1.33) and unvaccinated individuals (M =
33.47%; SE = 1.01) holding significantly lower estimates (p < .001). There are no
significant differences between estimates of fully vaccinated populations for partial and
unvaccinated individuals (𝛽 = 1.10, p = 1.103).
For estimates of partially vaccinated populations, individuals who were partially
vaccinated held the highest judgements (M = 32.08%; SE = 1.02), with fully vaccinated
individuals (M = 23.32%; SE = 0.71) and unvaccinated individuals (M = 23.71%; SE =
0.78) holding significantly lower estimates (p < .001). There are no significant differences
between estimates of partially vaccinated populations for fully and unvaccinated
individuals (𝛽 = 9.15, p = 9.147).
For estimates of unvaccinated populations, individuals who were unvaccinated held
the highest judgements (M = 33.35%; SE = 1.27), with fully vaccinated individuals (M =

significantly lower estimates (p < .001). The estimates mean judgements of fully and
partially vaccinated individuals were shown to be significant differences (𝛽 = 9.15, p <
.001).
3.6.6 Vaccine manufacturer and vaccine belief. Further analysis was
conducted to explore differences as a direct consequence of the strain of vaccinations
provided (whether from Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson), to this aim,
qualitative comparisons were conducted of stated and revealed preferences of social
distancing as expressed through vaccine belief statements and social distancing judgements
respectively.
To investigate the effect of vaccine manufacturer on vaccine belief, a fixed-effects
linear regression was conducted, regressing vaccine belief on the different vaccine
manufacturers with a vector of control variables. This model includes vaccine manufacturer
and not vaccine status, as not all vaccine manufacturers provide multiple doses for full
immunity, meaning comparisons cannot be held between against partially vaccinated
individuals. The most common vaccine manufacturer was used as the reference group
(Pfizer BioNTech) and heteroskedastic robust standard errors were estimated using the
sandwich package (Zeileis, 2006).
These results show a siginificant effect of age (𝛽 = 0.01, p < .001), where for each
increase in year, beliefs in the vaccine grow by 0.01. There is also find a significant effect of
employment (𝛽 = 0.25, p < .001), suggesting that employed individuals hold a stronger
belief than unemployed individuals. The model reveals a significant effect for vaccine
belief in vaccine eﬀicacy (M = 7.53; SE = 0.07), compared to Johnson & Johnson which
expressed the lowest held belief (M = 6.89; SE = 0.13; 𝛽 = -0.64, p < .001); as well as
Moderna (M = 7.19; SE = 0.08; 𝛽 = -0.34, p < .001) and even Oxford/AstraZeneca (with
an estimated mean of (M = 7.14; SE = 0.16; 𝛽 = -0.40, p < .001).

3.7 Vaccine manufacturer and social distancing
To investigate the effect of vaccine manufacturer on vaccine belief, a mixed-effects
linear regression was conducted regressing vaccine belief on the different vaccine
manufacturers, including the vector of control variables with a random effect for each
subject. This model also includes vaccine manufacturer and not vaccine status, as not all
vaccine manufacturers provide multiple doses for full immunity, meaning comparisons
cannot be held between fully and vaccinated individuals. The most common vaccine
manufacturer was used as the reference group (Pfizer BioNTech).
Investigating the effect of vaccine manufacturer on social distancing, as a form of
revealed preferences was able to replicate the effects for location (F(1, 2360) = 46.82, p <
.001) and activity (F(2, 2360) = 348.01, p < .001). The model also demonstrates that
individuals do not differ in their degree of social distancing as a function of vaccine
4 Discussion
This study investigated the use of social distancing task in an online setting to
estimate population differences between different vaccine states in social distancing across
different settings. The results demonstrate greater beliefs in vaccine eﬀicacy is met with
greater social distancing. However there is a moderated effect of vaccine belief for different
vaccine states on social distancing. Unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals
socially distance further as their belief in vaccine eﬀicacy grows. However it was observed
for fully vaccinated individuals that they would socially distance less as their belief in
vaccine eﬀicacy grows.
When exploring the underlying conditions, the results showed significant population
differences in average strength of beliefs, with fully vaccinated individuals holding the
strongest beliefs, closely followed by partially vaccinated and then unvaccinated
individuals. These population differences may represent possible underlying personality or

risk differences. For example, it may be likely that individuals who hold very high beliefs in
vaccine eﬀicacy are more likely to get vaccinated earlier and may be further along the
vaccination pathway than others (partially vaccinated). Whilst, the low vaccine belief held
by unvaccinated individuals may represent their underlying vaccine hesitancy. However, as
these are population differences these are correlational associations and no causal
inferences can be made.
These results are consistent with risk compensation demonstrating population
differences in perceived risk, beliefs in vaccine eﬀicacy and social distancing as a function of
vaccine status. This finding is likely the result of competing signals of risk (risk of
COVID-19, belief in vaccine eﬀicacy and the effects of social distancing), as a consequence
different populations can likely amplify different signals of risk and will adjust their
behaviour accordingly to moderate the overall risk exposure. Increase in vaccine belief for
those who are vaccinated is associated with reduced physical distancing, whilst partially
and unvaccinated populations increase social distancing as their belief in vaccine eﬀicacy
increases. These interactions are consistent with risk compensation, as the participants
who perceive the greatest reduction in risk because they believe masks provide protection
also engage in the greatest extent of risk compensation behaviour (Luckman et al., 2021;
Underhill, 2013).
These results do conflict with the findings of Sun et al. (2022), who found that
vaccinations were not associated with risk compensation. However, an important
distinction between these two studies were that the behaviour directly measured was in
handwashing whilst in this study was social distancing. The link between the two measures
in the present study is closer than by Sun et al. (2022). Furthermore, the context is
different with US citizens in the current study compared to Chinese citizens, and the study
design uses an online natural experiment, whilst Sun and colleagues employed a field
experiment measuring real-world behaviour. The results are consistent Buckell et al.
(2021), who demonstrated risk compensation in a field setting using survey methods.
VACCINATION, BELIEF AND RISK 34
In addition to the main finding of risk compensation, the results suggest that vaccine
intentions are also linked with risk compensatory behaviours, where individuals will
willingly reduce social distancing if they intend to get the vaccine. Exploratory analysis
also demonstrated a motivated reasoning of perceived vaccination distributions, where
individuals held significantly greater judgements for their estimates of the proportion of
their own vaccine status groups over others.
The implications of these findings for governmental policy on public health measures
surrounding social distancing. If the policy is for physical distancing across the board, then
vaccinations may lead to reduced social distancing once the vaccine rollouts reach a critical
mass. This is a crucial time in which mutated strains could post a threat to public health
(Hossain, Hassanzadeganroudsari, & Apostolopoulos, 2021; Madhi et al., 2021). It is
possible that policymakers are aware of the issue of risk compensation and that such policy
may even have a perverse effect of increasing the absolute risk of viral transmission.
This study does demonstrate evidence of risk compensation, but more information is
required to ascertain whether transmission is impacted by vaccinated individuals reducing
their social distancing. Future research should replicate the findings in a field setting, using
tracking data to monitor for location and distancing between strangers. Furthermore,
further research may be warranted to identify the construct validity of using avatar-based
online research as preferences of scaled distancing.
In future pandemic situations, where the goal of public health policy is to reduce
transmission rates, then people’s willingness to compensate vaccination eﬀicacy for social
distancing may be problematic if mutated strains emerge that the vaccine do not permit
significant protection against. In this situation, this study’s results would suggest that
transmission rates would increase as a result of vaccination. It would therefore be of value
for policy makers to produce guidelines of vaccination provide suﬀicient clarity regarding
their value and eﬀicacy in the specific contexts they apply. For instance, by placing
importance on vaccination compliments social distancing as opposed to being an alternative
VACCINATION, BELIEF AND RISK 35
interventional means, may improve public health compliance. Future research should test
such behavioural interventions (Bavel et al., 2020; West, Michie, Rubin, & Amlôt, 2020).
It should be noted that the experiment focused on a US sample, but that similar
results would likely be observed if using similar sample populations with similar public
health policies. These results could be particularly relevant especially given the delta and
omicron variants which were found to be 50-70% more transmissible (Hossain et al., 2021).
In the context of a mutation, countries would need to enforce greater social distancing to
allow for risk compensation and act as a potential anchor of physical distancing.
