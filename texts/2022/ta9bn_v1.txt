22 Abstract
23 A fundamental objective in Auditory Sciences is understanding how people learn to generalize
24 auditory category knowledge in new situations. How we generalize to novel scenarios speaks
25 to the nature of emergent category representations and generalization mechanisms in handling
26 perceptual variabilities and novelty. The dual learning system (DLS) models propose that
27 auditory category learning involves an explicit, hypothesis-testing learning system, which is
28 optimal for learning rule-based (RB) categories, and an implicit, procedural-based learning
29 system, which is optimal for learning categories requiring pre-decisional information
30 integration (II) across acoustic dimensions. Although DLS describes distinct mechanisms of
31 two types of category learning, it is yet clear the nature of acquired representations and how
32 we transfer them to new contexts. Here, we conducted three experiments to examine
33 differences between II and RB category representations by examining what acoustic and
34 perceptual variabilities affect learners’ generalization success. Learners can generalize to
35 different sets of untrained sounds after only eight training blocks for both II and RB categories.
36 The category structures and novel contexts differentially modulated the generalization success.
37 The II learners significantly decreased generalization performances when categorizing new
38 items derived from an untrained perceptual area and in a context with more distributed samples.
39 In contrast, RB learners’ generalizations are resistant to changes in perceptual regions but are
40 sensitive to changes in sound dispersity. Representational similarity modeling revealed that the
41 generalization in the more dispersed sampling context was accomplished differently by II and
42 RB learners. II learners increased representations of perceptual similarity and decision distance
43 to compensate for the decreased transfer of category representations, whereas the RB learners
44 used a more computational cost strategy by default, computing the decision-bound distance to
45 guide generalization decisions. These results suggest that distinct representations emerged after
46 learning the two types of category structures and using different strategies and flexible
47 mechanisms in resolving generalization challenges when facing novel perceptual variability in
48 new contexts. These findings provide new evidence for dissociated representations of auditory
49 categories and reveal novel generalization mechanisms in resolving different variabilities to
50 maintain perceptual constancy.

55 Introduction
56 Category learning ability allows us to learn to group items based on shared features or common
57 regularities across individual examples. The grouping knowledge acquired after learning is
58 considered abstract category representations guiding us to categorize items in new scenarios
59 (Kruschke, 1996; Smith and Minda, 1998, 2002; Love et al., 2004; Wills et al., 2006).
60 Successful generalization of learned category knowledge requires coping with various
61 variabilities of within- and between-category exemplars. Failure to do so would affect critical
62 decisions in our lives and even survival (e.g., under-generalization: missing detecting early
63 signatures of serious diseases, or over-generalization: categorizing poison mushrooms as
64 eatable). Therefore, category learning requires forming mental representations to support an
65 appropriate level of generalization. However, we are not yet fully understand the nature of
66 these category representations and the differences in representational characteristics when
67 learning different category structures.
68 Category representations are formed in the process of interacting with category
69 members, where the structure and distributional patterns of the category members affect how
70 we learn and the nature of acquired category representations (Ashby and Maddox, 2005, 2011;
71 Chandrasekaran et al., 2014a, 2014b). Previous behavioral and neuroimaging studies suggest
72 that at least two distinct learning systems are involved in category learning across visual (e.g.,
73 Ashby and Maddox, 2005, 2011; Smith and Grossman, 2008) and auditory modalities
74 (Chandrasekaran et al., 2014a, 2014b; Feng et al., 2021b). An explicit, hypothesis-testing
75 learning system is considered to be optimal for learning rule-based (RB) categories, where
76 those categories can be categorized based on verbalized rules. In contrast, an implicit,
77 procedural-learning-based system is hypothesized to be optimal for learning category
78 structures requiring information integration (II) across multiple dimensions before making a
79 categorization decision (Ashby and Maddox, 2005; Ashby and Valentin, 2005).
80 Previous studies have demonstrated various factors that differentially affect the learning
81 of II and RB category structures. For example, feedback types (instant vs. delayed; with vs.
82 without feedback) affect learning II categories more than RB’s (Maddox et al., 2003; Maddox
83 and Ing, 2005); category-response mapping is more critical and specific for II category learning
84 than that of RB (Ashby et al., 2003; Maddox et al., 2004b, 2007, 2010). In contrast, RB
85 category learning is more affected by executive-function-related factors, e.g., concurrent
86 working memory task (Waldron and Ashby, 2001; Filoteo et al., 2010), stress (Ell et al., 2011),
87 feedback processing interference (Maddox et al., 2004a), number of categories (i.e., limitation
88 of working memory) (Maddox et al., 2004c). These findings support the dual learning system
3 / 43
89 (DLS) model that distinct neural and cognitive systems are involved in learning II and RB
90 categories.
91 Different category learning tasks recruiting distinct learning systems provides a helpful
92 framework to reason that distinct natures of category representations emerged after learning
93 (due to engaging different learning processes), and distinct mechanisms support learners to
94 generalize acquired representations to categorize new items that are different from training
95 samples in various levels of similarity. However, these predictions have not been
96 systematically tested to date, as we know, and there is no detailed description of the
97 representation nature and generalization mechanisms. In the present study, we aim to test these
98 predictions and reveal the abstraction levels of category representations of II and RB categories
99 by modeling learners’ categorization responses with representational similarity models and
100 examining how well learners generalize the learned category knowledge to novel contexts.
101 Generalization and categorization require accessing our learned category knowledge to
102 guide the judgment of within- and between-category members. Types and degrees of sampling
103 variabilities affect how well we generalize the learned category knowledge. To resolve
104 generalization challenges imposed by stimulus novelty and variabilities, we must form
105 category representations abstracted from individual exemplars-specific features at appropriate
106 levels (Raviv et al., 2022). The abstract form of category representations was previously
107 considered prototypes or rules. Prototype-based theories propose that category membership is
108 determined by the distance or similarity between members and a category prototype that is
109 abstracted from individual training samples (Posner and Keele, 1968; Reed, 1972; Rosch, 1973;
110 Homa et al., 1981; Smith and Minda, 2000). Rule or regularity derived from the hypothesis-
111 testing-based learning process is another abstract form of category representations. A rule may
112 refer to a dimensional boundary (e.g., Category A consists of larger items, while Category B
113 consists of smaller ones; a decision is based on the dimension of size) or complex combinations
114 of features (simultaneous presentation of features a and b belongs to Category A, while the
115 presentation of features a and c belongs to Category B) (Erickson and Kruschke, 1998; for
116 other instantiations of RB models, please see Ashby and Maddox, 1992; Maddox and Ashby,
117 1993). RB and prototype-based hypotheses would predict that surface variations in a new
118 context are less likely to affect the generalization of these abstract representations.
119 Successful generalization may also depend on exemplar-specific representations
120 acquired from the perceptual properties of training samples (Erickson and Kruschke, 1998,
121 2002). Exemplar-based models assume that categorizing new stimuli are based on the
122 similarities between new items and previously-experienced individual exemplars in a
4 / 43
123 psychological space (Medin and Schaffer, 1978; Estes, 1986; Nosofsky, 1986, 2011).
124 Exemplar- or feature-specific category representations was emerged and considered dominant
125 in learning categories with a II structure. For example, in the visual domains, II category
126 learners performed significantly less accurately when categorizing new items sampled from
127 untrained locations in the stimulus space (Casale et al., 2012). Similarly, changes in stimulus
128 dimensions significantly affected generalization performances even though the dimensions are
129 irrelevant to categorization (Filoteo et al., 2010; Grimm and Maddox, 2013). Rosedahl et al.
130 (2018) reported a more striking finding: learners exposed to items presented in one visual field
131 failed to categorize the same items in another visual field, suggesting visual-field-dependent
132 representations emerged after learning II categories. However, other studies revealed a
133 different pattern that II category learners can generalize learned representations to categorize
134 items from untrained perceptual locations in the visual domain (Nosofsky et al., 2005; Seger et
135 al., 2015). These mixed findings suggest that the abstractness of II category representations are
136 required further investigation.
137 Here we designed novel generalization paradigms to examine the nature and
138 abstractness of representations that emerged after learning auditory categories with II and RB
139 structures. We generated well-controlled non-speech auditory category structures with the
140 same perceptual dimensions: spectral and temporal modulations. These dimensions are
141 fundamentals of complex acoustic signals like music and speech, where their representations
142 are robustly associated with the activations in the auditory cortex (Schönwiesner and Zatorre,
143 2009). We sampled sounds from two-category II and RB structures separately in the two-
144 dimensional space, where the RB structure prefers categorization using an explicit decisional
145 criterion on the spectral-modulation dimension (high vs. low), and the II structure that was
146 created by rotating the RB structure by 45° anticlockwise requires integrating information from
147 the two dimensions. Importantly, we devised four generalization tests (see Fig. 1 for a graphical
148 illustration) by sampling new sounds that were different from the training samples in different
149 degrees to probe the abstractness of the learned category knowledge. The four tests consist of
150 a baseline generalization test without inducing new variations, but the items were not exposed
151 in the training sessions; a “fundamental frequency (F0)” test where a change in acoustic
152 dimension (i.e., F0) irrelevant to the categorization was induced; a “new dispersity (ND)” test
153 where the dispersity of the generalization sounds increased compared to the training samples
154 while the sampling range in the perceptual space remains unchanged; and a “new location (NL)”
155 test where the generalization sounds were sampled from an untrained region of the perceptual
156 space. Successful generalization to the four tests requires learners to form and transfer
5 / 43
157 representations with different abstraction levels, ranging from generalizing category
158 knowledge across items with surface acoustic differences (F0 test) to items with different
159 distributional patterns (i.e., ND test: sound dispersity; NL test: perceptual areas).
160 According to the DLS model, learning RB categories is dominated by an explicit
161 learning system associated with working memory and executive hypothesis-testing functions
162 (Chandrasekaran et al., 2014a, 2014b; Feng et al., 2021b). Thus, DLS predicts that RB category
163 representations are abstracted from individual training samples and the associated features. RB
164 learners can generalize the learned category knowledge to untrained items with different
165 variabilities. If this is the case, we would predict that RB learners perform equally well across
166 the four generalization tests. In contrast, II auditory category learning is hypothesized to be
167 dominated by an implicit learning system that maps sounds onto categories via corticostriatal
168 systems (Chandrasekaran et al., 2014a, 2014b; Feng et al., 2021b). This implicit sound-to-
169 category mapping learning is not consciously penetrable and requires accessing and integrating
170 information from multiple dimensions (Ashby et al., 2003; Maddox et al., 2007; Smith et al.,
171 2015; Rosedahl et al., 2018). Therefore, the DLS model predicts that II category knowledge
172 tightly pertains to sample-specific features and the weighting of the features in perceptual space.
173 If this hypothesis is correct, we would predict that II learners will decrease generalization
174 performances in F0, ND, and NL tests compared to the baseline test. The degree of
175 generalization decrease depends on the abstractness of II representations. If the emergent II
176 representations are strictly specific to exemplar features, any acoustic changes will affect
177 generalization performance equally. However, if the representations are not strictly exemplar-
178 specific, II learners can resist certain degrees of acoustic and perceptual changes. Thus, the
179 generalization performance will be as a function of the four tests (e.g., baseline > F0 > ND >
180 NL).
181 We conducted three auditory category learning experiments to test the DLS model and
182 the above predictions, focusing on the nature of II and RB category representations and
183 generalization mechanisms. Across three experiments, we also examined whether
184 categorization-based training (in Exp. 2.1 vs. observation-based training in Exp. 1) and
185 providing feedback (Exp. 2.2) could facilitate category learning and generalization and alter
186 the nature of emergent representations. Numerous studies showed that category training
187 procedures modulate learning outcomes (e.g., Ashby et al., 1999, 2002; Goudbeek et al., 2008,
188 2009; Levering and Kurtz, 2015). Compared to observational training, categorization training
189 could facilitate category learning by learning to attend to discriminative features among
190 categories while ignoring within-category item variabilities (Hsu and Griffiths, 2010; Levering
6 / 43
191 and Kurtz, 2015). In addition, providing immediate feedback was considered a prerequisite for
192 learning II categories (Maddox et al., 2003; Maddox and Ing, 2005). Specifically, feedback
193 facilitates performances in learning auditory and speech categories (Goudbeek et al., 2009).
194 Participants were constrained to use a sub-optimal strategy to learn categories without feedback
195 (Ashby et al., 1999). We examined to which extent the two factors augment the differences
196 between II and RB category representations. In addition to categorization accuracies averaged
197 across trials, we modeled trial-by-trial categorization responses with representational similarity
198 analysis (RSA) (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008) for each generalization test to reveal the nature of
199 emergent representations of each category structure. With pre-defined representational models,
200 RSA enables us to reveal how different informational content besides category knowledge
201 emerged in generalization when facing different changes.
Materials and Methods
204 Participants
205 A total of 104 adults (88 females, age range = 18-27 years) were recruited from South China
206 Normal University communities for three auditory-category learning and generalization
207 experiments. For each experiment, participants were assigned to one of the training groups
208 according to the category structures (i.e., II or RB). In Experiment 1, two participants’ data
209 were removed from further analyses because they misunderstood the task instruction (i.e.,
210 performed categorization in Exp. 1). There were 35 participants left (II group: mean age =
211 21.12, SD = 2.74, N = 17; RB group: mean age = 19.39, SD = 1.69, N = 18). In Experiment 2,
212 two participants’ data were removed because they missed more than one-third of test trials in
213 at least three generalization tests. There are 32 participants in Exp. 2.1 (II group: mean age =
214 19.50, SD = 1.37, N = 16; RB group: mean age = 20.31, SD = 1.58, N = 16), and 33 participants
215 in Exp. 2.2 (II group: mean age = 19.75, SD = 1.98, N = 16; RB group: mean age = 20, SD =
216 2.15, N = 17). These six groups of participants across the three experiments were matched in
217 age (chi-square = 7.570, p = 0.182) and gender (F = 1.770, p = 0.127). All participants
(5,94)
218 reported normal hearing and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. No participant reported
219 a history of neurological disorders or reading disabilities. All materials and protocols were
220 approved by the ethics review board of the School of Psychology at South China Normal
221 University and the Joint Chinese University of Hong Kong – New Territories East Cluster
222 Clinical Research Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained before the
223 experiment.

225 Stimulus Construction
226 Ripple sounds were generated by modulating a white noise stimulus, varying along spectral
227 and temporal modulation dimensions (duration = 500 ms, digital sampling rate = 44.1 kHz).
228 The spectral-modulation dimension ranges from 0.1 to 2 cyc/oct. The temporal-modulation
229 dimension ranges from 4 to 10 Hz (Fig. 1). We selected these modulation ranges since they are
230 strongly represented in the human auditory cortex (Schönwiesner and Zatorre, 2009) and reflect
231 the complexity of natural spectro-temporal variations in speech (Elliott and Theunissen, 2009).
232 All sounds were synthesized with in-house scripts with MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA,
233 USA), and the RMS amplitude was normalized to 80 dB.
234 Two sets of ripple sounds were generated for category training based on predefined
235 two-categories II and RB structures, respectively. We created two bivariate distributions in a
236 normalized two-dimensional space along the positive diagonal to generate sounds of the II
237 categories. This normalized space ranges from 0 to 1 along spectral and temporal modulation
238 dimensions. The centers of two II categories are in the locations of [temp. = 0.39, spec. = 0.61]
239 and [temp. = 0.61, spec. = 0.39]. The standard deviation (SD) is 0.15 for the longer axis and
240 0.05 for the shorter axis with an orthogonal design. The optimal category bound is along the
241 positive diagonal (Fig. 1A upper panel, red dashed lines). We randomly sampled 480 ripple
242 sounds for the II category structure. Values along each dimension were logarithmically mapped
243 onto temporal and spectral modulation dimensions. The RB category sounds were generated
244 by rotating the II samples by 45° anticlockwise, and the centers of the two categories were
245 shifted to [temp. = 0.55, spec. = 0.35] and [temp. = 0.55, spec. = 0.65] (Fig. 1A lower panel).

250 Fig. 1. Ripple sounds of II and RB category structures used for training (A) and generalization
251 tests (B). Two categories of sounds are plotted in different colors (Category 1: red, Category 2:
252 blue) in a two-dimensional (i.e., spectral and temporal modulation dimensions) space. The red
253 dashed lines represent the optimal boundaries separating the two categories. Dashed ellipses
254 represent the coverage regions of the training samples. Sampling parameters (i.e., F0 and
255 dispersity) are listed at the top of each graph. F0 = fundamental frequency; SD = standard
256 deviation of each within-category sampling distribution.
258 To uncover the nature of emergent representations of auditory II and RB categories, we
259 examined the extent to which the learners generalized the learned category knowledge to four
260 different sets of generalization sounds that deviated from the training samples in acoustic and
261 distributional properties (see Fig. 1B for a graphical illustration). In the control test (CT), the
262 new sounds were sampled from the same distribution as the training samples but not exposed
263 during training. The CT serves as a baseline of generalization. Any generalization
264 performances increase or decrease in other tests compared to CT could be due to the changes
265 in acoustic or contextual factors in those tests. In the “fundamental frequency (F0)” test, we
266 introduced a new acoustic dimension irrelevant to the categorization. The F0 of these new
267 sounds was changed from 150 Hz (used in all experiments and generalization tests except the
268 F0 test) to 250 Hz. This manipulation is similar to the change from a male to a female speaker
269 to produce sounds. In the “new dispersity (ND)” test, we increased within-category sound
270 dispersity in this generalization context (i.e., more sampling variations for each category than
9 / 43
271 the training sounds). Dispersity of the ND sounds increased in both the long and short axes
272 (from [SD = 0.15, SD = 0.05] to [SD = 0.22, SD = 0.07]), while the coverage areas
long short long short
273 in the stimulus space (i.e., Fig. 2, dashed ellipse) remain unchanged. In the “new location (NL)”
274 test, we sampled novel sounds from a location outside the coverage range of the training
275 samples in the stimulus space. The category distributions were moved away along the optimal
276 decision bound to the left edge of the training samples, resulting in new centers of the two
277 categories (i.e., coordinate of the centers; II category 1: [temp. = 0.11, spec. = 0.32], category
278 2: [temp. = 0.32, spec. = 0.11]; RB category 1: [temp. = 0.15, spec. = 0.35], category 2: [temp.
279 = 0.15, spec. = 0.65]). The new centers are 2.67 SDs away from the centers of the training
280 samples. These four types of manipulation were applied equally to II and RB categories to
281 generate four generalization tests (Fig. 1B). We generated 240 ripple sounds for each
282 generalization test.
284 Training and generalization procedures
285 We conducted three experiments by manipulating the training procedure to examine whether
286 categorization and providing feedback could facilitate category learning and generalization. In
287 Exp. 1, participants were asked to learn to associate category labels with sounds via
288 observational training (OT) procedure (Fig. 2A, left panel). For each training trial, a fixation
289 cross was presented for 200 ms, followed by a category label (i.e., “类别 1” or “类别 2”)
290 displayed on the screen. One second after the category label appeared, a sound was presented
291 for 500 ms. Participants were instructed to learn the associations between sounds and category
292 labels without making any categorization response. After each trial, a jittered inter-trial interval
293 (randomly sampling between 1 and 2 seconds) was added to minimize the effects of temporal
294 prediction. Each participant completed eight blocks of OT. Each training block consists of 60
295 trials.
296 Participants were asked to complete the four generalization tests twice, one
297 immediately following training and another one week after (Fig. 2B). The CT was always
298 performed first to minimize the influence of the other tests. The order of the other three tests
299 (i.e., F0, ND, and NL) was counterbalanced across participants. Each generalization test
300 consists of two blocks (60 trials/block). The training and testing were conducted in a sound-
301 attenuated booth using E-Prime software (Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Sharpsburg, PA,
302 USA). The sounds were presented over headphones (Sennheiser HD280 pro) at a comfortable
303 listening level.

307 experiments to train participants to learn auditory categories. A, three category training
308 paradigms. The time frames for categorization response and feedback presentation are

311 In Exp. 2.1, participants first completed four blocks of OT (session 1) and performed
312 another four blocks of categorization training with no feedback (CT-NF) in session 2 (Fig. 2B).
313 The OT procedure was the same as Exp. 1. In the CT-NF sessions, for each trial, a fixation
314 cross was presented for 200 ms, followed by a ripple sound for 500 ms. Participants were
315 instructed to categorize sounds into one of the two categories without feedback (Fig. 2A,
316 middle panel). In Exp. 2.2, the same training paradigm was used as the Exp. 2.1 except for
317 providing corrective feedback for each categorization response (i.e., CT-WF, see Fig. 2A right
318 panel) in the training session 2. Visual feedback (i.e., “Right” or “Wrong”) was displayed for
319 500 ms after each response. If participants failed to respond within 2 seconds following the
320 sound onset, cautionary feedback was presented (i.e., “No response”). A jittered inter-trial
321 interval was added after each trial. The generalization test is a categorization task without
322 providing feedback, the same as the CT-NF. The test procedure was the same across the three
323 experiments.

325 Data analysis
326 Representation modeling
327 Although categorization accuracy provides an overall performance for each generalization test,
328 it does not tell us how sound-by-sound variabilities in response patterns and category
329 confusions link with category knowledge acquired in training. Therefore, we employed a
330 representational similarity analysis (RSA) approach (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008; Feng et al.,
331 2021c) to examine the degree of category representations applied to each test and whether there
332 are additional sampling-related information emerged in aid of generalization. We calculated
333 representation similarities between three pre-defined representation models and categorization
334 response confusions across learner groups and experiments.

339 models were pre-defined based on category labels, bound-based decision distance, and center-
340 based perceptual similarity. B, illustration of a response confusion matrix and representative
341 examples of response confusion matrices for the four generalization tests.
12 / 43
343 We constructed three representation models (see Fig. 3A) based on binary category
344 labels, bound-based decision distance, and center-based perceptual similarity from the training
345 samples to uncover the nature of emergent representations in generalization. These models
346 reflect three types of category-related information that the learners could acquire during
347 learning. These models are operationally defined by representational dissimilarity matrices
348 (RDMs) to fit the behavioral response RDMs derived from trial-by-trial categorization
349 response patterns (Fig. 3B).
350 The category model (and the corresponding RDM) represents abstract category labels
351 and is designed to have only two values: 0 if two sounds are from the same category or 1 if
352 they are from different categories. The bound-based decision distance model was created based
353 on the Euclidean distance between each sound and the optimal category bound in the
354 normalized spectral-temporal-modulation space (Fig. 3A). The center-based perceptual
355 similarity model was created based on the Euclidean distance between the center of each
356 category and every sound in the 2-dimensional space. The following equation was used to
357 convert the Euclidean distance to the within-category and between-category perceptual
358 similarity (PS) for each sound:
"#
359 𝑃𝑆 = 𝑒 !,# .
"#
360 𝐷 denotes Euclidean distance between sound i and the center of category C1 or C2; 𝑒 !,#
!,%
361 denotes the PS of sound i to category C1 or C2. These PSs were first normalized by scaling
362 between 0 and 1, then converted to dissimilarities (i.e., one minus similarities) to generate the
363 model RDM. These model RDMs were constructed based on training samples and applied to
364 fit response RDMs for each generalization test. High model fittings indicate the robust transfer
365 of the category and sound-related knowledge acquired in training to the generalization tests.
366 To calculate the model fit of each model in each generalization test, we first computed
367 a response RDM based on trial-by-trial responses for each block of the tests. Suppose two
368 sounds are responded with the same key, their dissimilarity equal 0, otherwise 1. We sorted
369 items in the response RDM based on their category labels and location in the stimulus space
370 (see Fig. 3B for representative response RDMs). To fit the response RDMs, we generated the
371 pre-defined model RDMs based on the sampling distributions of II and RB structures used in
372 training sessions separately. To avoid sampling bias due to a limited number of sounds in each
373 block, we conducted sampling simulations with 10,000 iterations for each model RDM. A
374 model RDM was generated for each simulation and correlated with the response RDMs with
13 / 43
375 Spearman correlation. Average correlation rho was computed for each test and subject. We
376 also examined the unique contribution of each model with a partial correlation approach to
377 control for the variance of the other two models.
379 Mixed effects modeling
380 We analyzed participants’ categorization accuracy (ACC), response time, and RSA model fits
381 using linear mixed-effects regression (LMER) analysis. We aim to examine the effects of the
382 generalization test and category structure (II vs. RB learners) on generalization accuracy and
383 model fit for each experiment. We also directly compared the effects of generalization tests
384 (i.e., F0 vs. CT; ND vs. CT; NL vs. CT) across the three experiments to examine whether the
385 training procedure modulates generalization performances. The fixed effects of interest were
386 the category structure and four generalization tests. The LMER analyses were performed with
387 the software R (version 4.1.0). We analyzed the variances of the LMER models to reveal the
388 statistical significance of the fixed factors and the interaction effects. Effect sizes were

392 Experiment 1
393 Both II and RB learners performed significantly above chance (0.5) in the four generalization
394 tests conducted immediately after training (Bonferroni-corrected ps < 0.01, see Fig. 4A). We
395 consider CT as the baseline test of generalization because the sounds in this test were generated
396 from the same sampling distribution as the training samples. Thus, any differences in
397 performance between CT and the other three tests are presumable due to the differences
398 between training and generalization samples in sound properties. For II learners, planned
399 comparisons revealed that the categorization accuracy in the NL test was significantly lower
400 than CT test (t = -6.103, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -1.142), while no significant difference was
(16)
401 found in the F0 vs. CT (t = 0.460, p = 1, Cohen d = 0.048) or ND vs. CT comparison (t =
(16) (16)
402 -2.334, p = 0.099, Cohen d = -0.369). On the contrary, for RB learners, the categorization
403 accuracy was significantly lower in F0 (t = -2.976, p = 0.025, Cohen d = -0.512), but not in
(17)
404 ND (t = -2.178, p = 0.131, Cohen d = -0.289) or NL tests (t = -0.703, p = 1, Cohen d = -

407 The representation modeling of the category model showed similar patterns as the
409 chance (i.e., rho = 0) across the four tests and two learner groups (Bonferroni-corrected ps <
410 0.01), indicating category representations were transferred in the generalization tests
411 immediately after training. Planned comparisons showed the same significance patterns as that
412 of the categorization accuracy: II learners, NL vs. CT (t = -4.856, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -

424 We conducted the same generalization tests one week after training to examine whether
425 the representation properties change over time. Overall, generalization patterns were similar to
426 those found in the immediate tests (Fig. 4C&D). For categorization accuracy (Fig. 4C),
427 generalization performances were significantly lower in ND and NL tests than that in CT for
428 II learners (ND vs. CT: t = -2.775, p = 0.041, Cohen d = -0.429; NL vs. CT: t = -2.935, p
(16) (16)
429 = 0.029, Cohen d = -0.582; F0 vs. CT: t = -1.435, p = 0.512, Cohen d = -0.137), similar to
(16)
15 / 43
430 the immediate tests. However, no planned comparison was significant for RB learners (see Fig.
433 showed that the model fits were significantly lower in ND and NL tests than that in CT for II
434 learners (ND vs. CT: t = -2.998, p = 0.026, Cohen d = -0.459; NL vs. CT: t = -3.004, p =

(16)
436 reduced category representations in the two tests. For RB learners, the pattern of model fits
437 was different from the immediate tests. Compared to CT, the category model fits in ND were
438 significantly decreased (t = -3.367, p = 0.011, Cohen d = -0.637), but increased model fits
(17)
439 were found in NL (t = 3.425, p = 0.010, Cohen d = 0.778), indicating a dissociated pattern
(17)
440 in the two tests for RB learners. No significant difference was found between F0 and CT test
441 (t = 1.235, p = 0.701, Cohen d = 0.206).
(17)
443 Experiment 2
444 Overall performance in training
445 During categorization training, participants from both learner groups performed significantly
446 better than chance in training session 2 (see Fig. S1 in Supplementary). Specifically, the
447 categorization accuracy in the last training block (i.e., block 8) was significantly higher than
448 the chance for both II (Exp. 2.1: t = 17.081, p < 0.001, Cohen d = 6.039; Exp. 2.2: t =
(15) (15)
449 32.023, p < 0.001, Cohen d = 11.322) and RB learners (Exp. 2.1: t = 8.330, p < 0.001, Cohen
(15)
450 d = 2.945; Exp. 2.2: t = 7.263, p < 0.001, Cohen d = 2.491). II and RB learners were
(16)
451 performed similarly at the end of training (Exp. 2.1: t = 1.063, p = 0.592, Cohen d = 0.376;
(30)
452 Exp. 2.2: t = 1.900, p = 0.134, Cohen d = 0.662).
(31)
453 For Exp. 2.1 (CT without feedback), LMER revealed a significant main effect of
454 category structure (F = 17.185, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.12) and a category-structure-
(1, 127.35)
455 by-training-block interaction (F = 7.266, p = 0.008, partial η2 = 0.07), while the main effect
(1, 96)
456 of training block was not significant (F = 0.708, p = 0.402, partial η2 < 0.01). Simple effect
(1, 96)
457 analyses revealed a significant main effect of the training block for RB learners (F = 5.872,
(1,48)
458 p = 0.019, partial η2 = 0.11) but not for II learners (F = 1.838, p = 0.182, partial η2 = 0.04),
(1,48)
459 which may indicate that RB learners increased performances in training session 2 whereas II
460 learners’ performance reaches a plateau. For Exp. 2.2, LMER revealed a significant main effect
461 of training block (F = 6.321, p = 0.014, partial η2 = 0.06). No other effect was found
(1, 99)
462 significant.

464 Generalization performances in Exp. 2.1
465 This experiment examines whether categorization training without feedback could facilitate
466 category learning and modulate generalization patterns across the four tests. As shown in Fig.
467 5A, both learner groups performed significantly above chance in the four tests conducted
468 immediately after training. For the II learners, planned comparisons showed significantly
469 decreased categorization accuracy in ND (t = -7.189, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -0.977) and NL
(15)
470 tests (t = -5.749, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -1.582) compared to CT. Changes in F0 did not affect
(15)
471 generalization (F0 vs. CT: t = -0.120, p = 1, Cohen d = 0.027). Changes in sound dispersity
(15)
472 also affected generalization performances for RB learners (ND vs. CT: t = -3.538, p = 0.009,
(15)
473 Cohen d = -0.384), whereas the other two factors did not affect generalization (F0 vs. CT: t
(15)
474 = 0.201, p = 1, Cohen d = 0.025; NL vs. CT: t = 0.049, p = 1, Cohen d = 0.007). These
(15)
475 generalization patterns are similar to those found in Exp. 1.
476 Model fits of the category model were all significantly better than chance across tests
477 and learner groups (Fig. 5B and Fig. S3). For II learners, similar to the accuracy data, we found
478 significantly decreased category model fits in ND and NL tests compared to CT (ND vs. CT:
479 t = -7.146, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -1.071; NL vs. CT: t = -6.309, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -
(15) (15)
480 1.890). Increased sound dispersity also significantly affected category representations in ND
481 for RB learners (ND vs. CT: t = -3.719, p = 0.006, Cohen d = -0.451). No other contrasts

493 Generalization tests performed one week after training were all significantly above
494 chance across learner groups (Fig. 5C). Similar to the immediate tests, for II learners, changes
495 in sound dispersity and locations in the perceptual space significantly affected generalization
496 performances (ND vs. CT: t = -3.037, p = 0.025, Cohen d = -0.667; NL vs. CT: t = -4.971,
(15) (15)
497 p < 0.001, Cohen d = -1.313), but not for the F0 changes (F0 vs. CT: t = 0.253, p = 1, Cohen
(15)
498 d = 0.072). In contrast, RB learners’ generalizations were not affected by these factors (F0 vs.
499 CT: t = -0.263, p = 1, Cohen d = 0.045; ND vs. CT: t = -2.342, p = 0.100, Cohen d = -
(15) (15)
500 0.383; NL vs. CT: t = 0.370, p = 1, Cohen d = 0.066), which may indicate a certain degree
(15)
501 of representation transformation over time. The representation modeling results are consistent
503 (t = -3.646, p = 0.007, Cohen d = -0.780); NL vs. CT (t = -5.952, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -
(15) (15)
504 1.302). No other comparison was found significant.
506 Generalization performances in Exp 2.2
507 In this experiment, we aim to examine to which extent categorization training with feedback
508 facilitates learning and generalization performances. However, we did not find a significant
509 difference in categorization performances between Exp. 2.1 and Exp. 2.2 at the end of training
510 (II learners: t = 1.741, p = 0.184, Cohen d = 0.616; RB learners: t = 0.011, p = 1, Cohen
(30) (31)
511 d = 0.004) and in the immediate CT (II learners: t = 0.019, p = 1, Cohen d = 0.007; RB
(30)
512 learners: t = 1.107, p = 0.554, Cohen d = 0.386).
(31)
513 In the immediate tests, similar to the Exp. 2.1, II and RB learners performed
514 significantly above chance in the four tests (Fig. 6A, all Bonferroni-corrected ps < 0.001). For
515 II learners, categorization accuracy and category model fits were both significantly decreased
516 in the ND (accuracy: t = -3.659, p = 0.007, Cohen d = -0.570; model fit: t = -4.515 p =
(15) (15)
517 0.001, Cohen d = -0.611) and NL tests (accuracy: t = -7.375, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -1.515;
(15)
518 model fit: t = -7.078, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -1.490) compared to CT. No other planned
(15)
519 comparison reached significance after correction (see Tables 1 and 2 for details).

526 indicate significant differences between CT and the other three tests. Asterisks denote
527 significantly above chance (Bonferroni-corrected p-values < 0.05).
529 For the generalization tests performed one week after training, categorization
530 accuracies and model fits of the category model were all significantly above chance across
531 learner groups (Fig. 6C&D). Similar to the immediate test, II learner’s categorization
532 accuracies and model fits were significantly decreased in the ND (accuracy: t = -5.546, p <
(15)
533 0.001, Cohen d = -0.929; model fit: t = -6.103, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -1.026) and NL tests
(15)
534 (accuracy: t = -6.009, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -1.523; model fit: t = -8.983, p < 0.001, Cohen
(15) (15)
535 d = -1.774) compared to CT. For RB learners, categorization accuracy was affected by the
536 changes in sound dispersity (ND vs. CT: t = -3.327, p = 0.013, Cohen d = -0.380), which is
(16)
537 different from the immediate generalization. Also, we found that model fits were significantly
538 higher in NL than in CT (t = 3.957, p = 0.003, Cohen d = 0.758), indicating better category
(16)
539 knowledge transferred in NL. No other planned comparison reached significance after
540 correction (see Tables 1 and 2 for details).
542 Statistical summaries across the three experiments
19 / 43
543 The above results highlighted the effects of generalization (i.e., F0/ND/NL vs. CT) and distinct
544 patterns in these effects for II and RB learners in each experiment. To directly compare
545 generalization effects across learner groups, experiments (i.e., training procedures), and types
546 of generalization, we used CT as a baseline to estimate the generalization effects induced by
547 changes in F0, sound dispersity (i.e., ND) and location in the perceptual space (i.e., NL).
548 Therefore, three types of generalization effects (i.e., F0 – CT; ND – CT; NL – CT) were
549 calculated for each learner, experiment, and testing session. A three-factor LMER was
550 conducted to reveal the main effects of learner group (II vs. RB), generalization type (F0-CT
551 vs. ND-CT vs. NL-CT), and training procedure (OT vs. CT-NF vs. CT-WF) as well as their
552 interaction effects.
553 For the immediate generalization performances (Fig. 7A), we found significant main
554 effects of learner group (F = 12.865, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.11) and generalization type
(1, 100)
555 (F = 33.069, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.25), and a significant learner-group-by-
(2, 200)
556 generalization-type interaction effect (F = 66.407, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.40) indicating
(2, 200)
557 different patterns of the generalization effects between II and RB learners. No other effect was
558 found significant. Similarly, for category model fit (Fig. 7B), we found significant main effects
559 of learner group (F = 25.376, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.20) and generalization type (F
(1, 100) (2, 200)
560 = 23.166, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.19), and a significant learner-group-by-generalization-test
561 interaction effect (F = 89.905, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.47). Since neither the main effect
(2, 200)
562 of training procedure nor any interaction effect related to training procedure was significant,
563 we conducted ad hoc comparisons with data collapsed across the three experiments.
564 Consistent with the results reported in each experiment, changes in sound dispersity
565 and location in the perceptual space significantly affected generalization performances for II
566 learners (accuracy: ND vs. CT, t = -6.577, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -1.329; NL vs. CT, t = -
(48) (48)
567 11.029, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -2.228; category model fit: ND vs. CT, t = -7.281, p < 0.001,
(48)
568 Cohen d = -1.471; NL vs. CT, t = -10.411, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -2.103). However, changes
(48)
569 in F0 did not affect generalization (accuracy: t = 0.182, p = 1, Cohen d = 0.037; category
(48)
570 model fit: t = 0.905, p = 1, Cohen d = 0.183). For RB learners, changes in F0 (accuracy: t
(48) (50)
571 = -2.850, p = 0.019, Cohen d = -0.564; category model fit: t = -3.195, p = 0.007, Cohen d =
(50)
572 -0.633) and sound dispersity (i.e., ND) (accuracy: t = -4.504, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -0.892;
(50)
573 category model fit: t = -3.870, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -0.766) significantly affect
(50)
574 categorization accuracy and the robustness of category representations in generalization.
575 Furthermore, the generalization effect of NL in categorization accuracy (Fig. 7A) was
576 more robust for II than RB learners (t = -7.912, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -1.583). For category
(98)
20 / 43
577 model fits (Fig. 7B), generalization effects of sound dispersity (i.e., ND) (t = -3.019, p =
(98)
578 0.009, Cohen d = -0.604) and location of perceptual space (i.e., NL) (t = -9.753, p < 0.001,
(98)
579 Cohen d = -1.951) were both more robust for II learners than that of RB. However, the
580 generalization effect of F0 was more robust for RB than II learners (t = 2.721, p = 0.023,
(98)
581 Cohen d = 0.544).
584 Fig. 7. Changes in generalization accuracy (A&C) and category model fit (B&D) for the
585 generalization tests performed immediately (A&B) or one week after training (C&D) for the
586 three experiments. Red asterisks under the curly brackets denote significant differences
587 between CT and the other three tests, with data collapsed across the three experiments. Red
588 lines denote significant differences between II and RB learners, with data collapsed across all
589 experiments. Asterisks at the bottom of each graph denote significant differences between CT
590 and the other three tests for each experiment. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; **, p < 0.001; p-values
591 were corrected.
593 Generalization effects for tests conducted one week after training was largely similar
594 to the immediate tests (Fig. 7C&D). Two intriguing differences were found between the
595 immediate tests and tests performed one week after training. Firstly, the generalization effect
596 of F0 was not significant for RB learners, neither for accuracy (t = -0.236, p = 1, Cohen d =
(50)
21 / 43
597 -0.047) nor category model fits (t = 1.426, p = 0.480, Cohen d = 0.282), which may indicate
(50)
598 of a category representation transformation or abstraction after training. The second difference
599 is that category model fits in NL for the RB learners were significantly higher than that in CT
600 (t = 5.707, p < 0.001, Cohen d = 1.130), indicating more category representations emerged
(50)
601 in the NL test conducted one week after training.
604 Fig. 8. Representation modeling of trial-by-trial response confusion matrices with three
605 predefined models using data collapsed across the three experiments. The unique contribution
606 of each model was calculated and subtracted from CT. Colored asterisks on the bottom of each
607 graph denote significant differences between CT and the other three tests. Arrow lines denote
608 significant differences between II and RB learners in modeling fit (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01;
609 **, p < 0.001; p-values were corrected).
611 We further examined what sound- or category-related knowledge was represented and
612 utilized in generalization and to which extent these representations changed due to the changes
613 in F0, sound dispersity, and locations of perceptual space. Thus, we used the three predefined
614 representation models to fit learners’ response RDMs and compared the model fits between CT
615 and the other three tests to reveal the representation changes. For all the generalization tests,
616 each of the three representation models was significantly correlated with learners’ response
617 RDMs (Fig. S3), indicating that these models all contribute to explaining learners’
618 categorization response patterns. The category model explained the most variances among the
619 three models across all tests except for ND. We further calculated the unique contribution of
620 each model in explaining the response confusion patterns by controlling the variances of the
621 other two models with the partial correlation approach and compared these model fits between
622 tests and learners (Fig. 8).
22 / 43
623 For generalization performed immediately after training, the F0 change only affected
624 category model fits for RB learners (Fig. 8A, left panel; F0 vs. CT: t = -2.555, p = 0.041,
(50)
625 Cohen d = -0.506). However, RB learners’ category representations increased one week after
626 training in the F0 test (Fig. 8A, right panel) and were significantly higher than CT (t = 3.421,
(50)
627 p = 0.003, Cohen d = 0.678). This increase in category representations was accompanied by a
628 decrease in the representation of decision distance (t = -2.929, p = 0.015, Cohen d = -0.580).
(50)
629 Compared to CT, increased sound dispersity in the ND test affected category
630 representations for both II and RB learners in generalization tests conducted immediately and
631 one week after training (Fig. 8B; II learners: immediate test, t = -6.825, p < 0.001, Cohen d
(48)
632 = -1.379; one week after training, t = -6.754, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -1.364; RB learners:
(48)
633 immediate test, t = -2.856, p = 0.019, Cohen d = -0.566; one week after training, t = -
(50) (50)
634 4.401, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -0.871). More decrease in category representations were found for
635 II than RB learners (t = -4.580, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -0.916). The decrease in category
(98)
636 representations was accompanied by an increase in representations of decision distance only
637 for II learners (immediate test: t = 3.945, p < 0.001, Cohen d = 0.797; one week after training:
(48)

643 Changes in locations of perceptual space in the NL test modulated the degrees of
644 category representations for both II and RB learners, but in opposite directions (Fig. 8C; II,

(50)
648 decreased category representations were accompanied by decreased representations of decision
649 distance (immediate test: t = -4.010, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -0.810; one week after training:

653 representations of decision distance (t = -6.050, p < 0.001, Cohen d = -1.222) and perceptual
(50)
654 similarity (t = -2.848, p = 0.019, Cohen d = -0.575) only for the tests performed one week

658 Regarding the categorization response time (RT), we found a significant main effect of
659 training procedure (F = 8.415, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.14). Faster categorization responses
(2,100)
660 were shown in Exp. 2.2 (CT-WF vs. OT: F = 10.528, p = 0.004, partial η2 = 0.13; CT-WF
(1, 68)
661 vs. CT-NF: F = 13.673, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.17). This training procedure effect is
(1, 65)
662 learner group general, suggesting that categorization training with feedback facilitates
663 categorization decisions in generalization. We also found a significant main effect of
664 generalization test (F = 3.532, p = 0.015, partial η2 = 0.01) where learners required a
(3, 700)
665 longer time to categorize in the ND test (ND vs. CT: F = 6.545, p = 0.033, partial η2 =
(1, 300)
666 0.02; F0 vs. CT: F = 0.078, p = 1, partial η2 < 0.001; NL vs. CT: F = 0.013, p = 1,
(1, 300) (1, 300)
667 partial η2 < 0.001). We did not find a significant main effect of leaner group (F = 1.123, p
(1,100)
668 = 0.292, partial η2 = 0.01) but found a significant learner-by-test interaction effect (F =
(3,700)
669 9.149, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.04). For II learners, the main effect of generalization test was
670 significant (F = 7.465, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.06), where the ND and NL tests responded
(3, 343)
671 significantly longer than other tests (F0 vs. CT: F = 1.034, p = 0.940, partial η2 = 0.007;
(1, 147)
672 ND vs. CT: F = 8.613, p = 0.012, partial η2 = 0.06; NL vs. CT: F = 6.600, p = 0.034,
(1, 147) (1, 147)
673 partial η2 = 0.04). In contrast, for RB learners, although the effect of generalization test was
674 also significant (F = 4.583, p = 0.007, partial η2 = 0.04), learners categorized sounds
(3, 357)
675 significantly faster in the NL test than in other tests (F0 vs. CT: F = 0.331, p = 1, partial
(1, 153)
676 η2 = 0.002; ND vs. CT: F = 0.463, p = 1, partial η2 = 0.003; NL vs. CT: F = 5.871, p
(1,153) (1,153)
677 = 0.050, partial η2 = 0.04).
679 Discussion
680 Learners’ ability to generalize to novel testing situations directly speaks to the nature of
681 representations acquired in previous category training and the mechanisms supporting cross-
682 situation transfer of category knowledge. Here, with this experimental logic, we designed four
683 generalization tests with different types of novel items and conducted three category learning
684 experiments with different training procedures to probe the differences in representation nature
685 between II and RB categories. Across three experiments, we found distinct characteristics of
686 the newly-acquired II and RB category representations indicated by generalization patterns and
687 representation modeling. II and RB learners transferred category knowledge to the four tests to
688 different extents. The II learners significantly decreased generalization performances and
689 category representations in the ND and NL tests but not in the F0 test compared to the baseline
24 / 43
690 test, which suggests that the generalization of II category knowledge is not affected by surface
691 acoustic changes in an irrelevant F0 dimension but less successful in categorizing new items
692 sampled from an untrained perceptual area (i.e., the NL test) and in a context with more
693 disperse samples (i.e., the ND test). In contrast, RB learners’ generalizations are resistant to
694 changes in perceptual regions (i.e., the NL test) and interference of the F0 change (especially
695 for the representations after stabilization, i.e., one week after training), but they are sensitive to
696 changes in increasing dispersity of exemplars (i.e., the ND test). Representational similarity
697 modeling further revealed that generalization in the ND test was accomplished by II and RB
698 learners with different strategies. II learners enhanced representations of perceptual similarity
699 and decision distance to compensate for the decreased transfer of category representations,
700 whereas RB learners used a more computational cost strategy by default, computing the
701 decision-bound distance to guide categorization decisions. These findings provide new insights
702 into understanding the relationships between category learning, the nature of category
703 representations, and how different learning and representation systems operate differently to
704 achieve successful generalization.
705 We aim to examine the representation nature of II and RB categories, especially the
706 abstractness of the category representations utilized in generalization. We manipulated three
707 factors in generalization, ranging from low-level surface acoustics to higher-level exemplar
708 dispersity and untrained perceptual location. Based on DLS models, especially in the visual
709 domains, II representations are tightly linked to the exemplar-dependent or feature-specific
710 information (e.g., visual field), and any changes in the low-level information affect
711 generalization performances (Ashby et al., 2003; Maddox et al., 2004b, 2005, 2007; Rosedahl
712 et al., 2018). However, across the three experiments, we demonstrate that II learners can resist
713 changes in F0 for generalization tests performed immediately and one week after training,
714 suggesting that auditory II category representations are not tightly linked to low-level
715 dimensions irrelevant to discriminating category members. Changes in F0 analog changes in
716 talker (e.g., Bradlow and Bent, 2008; Xie et al., 2021). This finding is consistent with previous
717 auditory and speech category learning studies that showed talker-independent category
718 representations emerged at both behavioral and neural levels during training (Bradlow and Bent,
719 2008; Feng et al., 2019, 2021c; Johnson and Sjerps, 2021; Xie et al., 2021). In speech
720 perception, native listeners can maintain perceptual constancy while facing various types of
721 acoustic and perceptual variabilities (Bradlow and Bent, 2008; Feng et al., 2018, 2021a),
722 suggesting exceptional generalization ability to overcome the “lack-of-invariance” challenge.
25 / 43
723 In comparison, RB learners’ generalization performances were not consistently affected
724 by F0 changes. The generalization performances in the immediate F0 test were significantly
725 less accurate than the control test, especially for Exp. 1 with observational training. However,
726 the generalization was insensitive to F0 changes one week after training across the three
727 experiments. These findings suggest that RB learners may undergo a transformation or
728 abstraction process within a week after training to stabilize the category representations to
729 overcome the variability induced by an irrelevant acoustic dimension. One speculation is that
730 this post-training abstraction or stabilization process is specific for RB categories, where the
731 F0 information could be fastly integrated into the previously-acquired categorization rules so
732 that the irrelevant acoustic information is eliminated before the decision (e.g., application of
733 new filtering rules). Adopting a new rule to filter irrelevant information while maintaining
734 attention to the relevant dimensions or features may require time and the support of executive
735 systems (Diekelmann and Born, 2010; Genzel et al., 2014). The distinct patterns between II
736 and RB learners in the F0 test suggest that the category structure we learn plays an important
737 role in how the auditory perception system copes with acoustic variabilities.
738 One of the critical tests for the abstractness of emerged representations is to test the
739 generalization to new sounds sampled from an untrained area of the stimulus space. We found
740 that significantly reduced generalization performances and decreased category model fittings
741 to new sounds outside the range of training samples (i.e., in the new location test) for II learners
742 across the three experiments. In contrast, increased generalization performances and enhanced
743 category representations for the RB learners were found in the same test. This dissociated
744 pattern suggests that II representations are tightly restricted to the perceptual areas where the
745 training samples are covered. The trained locations in the stimulus space may be weighted
746 differently than untrained areas, so the categorization performances are compromised when the
747 category knowledge is transferred from trained locations to untrained locations. These results
748 are consistent with previous findings from studies of visual category learning. For example,
749 Smith and colleagues (2015) asked two groups of participants to learn RB and II categories,
750 respectively, and required them to categorize new stimuli sampled from an untrained region of
751 the stimulus space. They found that RB learners’ generalization was nearly seamless, whereas
752 II learners failed to categorize the new items. Moreover, II representations are often linked with
753 exemplar-associated sensorimotor features. Changes in the visual field have significant
754 interferences of II categorization but not RB (Rosedahl et al., 2018), suggesting visual-field-
755 dependent representations of II categories. Similarly, changing the response key to categorize
756 items only affects the II categorization but not RB (Ashby et al., 2003), suggesting that visual
26 / 43
757 II categories are tightly associated with their motor correspondences. Comparing these findings
758 from visual domains, our findings in auditory category learning indicate that II auditory
759 category representations are only tightly linked to the perceptual properties of the dimensions
760 relevant to categorization instead of any other irrelevant dimensions (e.g., F0) inherent from
761 the training samples. This representation mechanism of II auditory categories may help
762 listeners precisely generalize category knowledge to novel items and scenarios with redundant
763 and irrelevant acoustic information.
764 Another critical test of the representation nature is to examine the generalization
765 performances to new sounds with distinct distributional patterns from the training samples. We
766 found that reduced categorization accuracy and decreased category representations when
767 learners generalized to a set of new sounds with a more dispersed distribution (i.e., the ND test)
768 compared to the training samples for both II and RB learners. These findings indicate that both
769 II and RB category representations are sensitive to the within-category sound distributional
770 pattern. DLS models predict that learning II and RB categories recruit distinct learning
771 strategies and neurocognitive systems (Ashby and Maddox, 2005, 2011; Chandrasekaran et al.,
772 2014a, 2014b). However, DLS models do not have detailed descriptions and predictions about
773 whether the category representations are associated with the within-category distributional
774 statists of the training samples. DLS model may predict that the generalization of II category
775 representations is affected by changes in sound dispersity because II category representations
776 are hypothesized to link with sample-specific features. This reasoning is supported by recent
777 findings that II but not RB categories with a probabilistic distribution are learned worse than
778 categories with a deterministic distribution (Roark and Holt, 2018), suggesting II category
779 representations are formed based on or along with distributional information. Any changes in
780 the stimulus distributional pattern would affect generalization performances. Even though the
781 overall coverage in the perceptual space is the same for the training and generalization samples,
782 the distributional patterns within each category are different. The training samples are normally
783 distributed in the space (more samples in the middle of the distribution), whereas the
784 generalization samples in the ND test are more distributed. Thus, our results suggest that
785 forming II category representations is a learning process that considers all types of variabilities
786 in the perceptual space. Any changes in sample distribution or the locations in the perceptual
787 space, whether within or outside the coverage of training samples, would affect the transfer of
788 the II category knowledge.
789 A perceptual weighting mechanism may explain the II generalization decreases in the
790 ND and NL tests (Niv et al., 2015). Successful learning of II auditory categories requires
27 / 43
791 integrating information from the spectral- and temporal-modulation dimensions. The
792 integration ratio of the two dimensions is subject to the distributions of training samples. The
793 distribution of the training samples provides statistical information about the category
794 probabilities for the learners to weigh the two dimensions. Learners may gradually adjust the
795 integration ratio or weights of the two dimensions as they expose to more samples. Higher
796 perceptual weights would be assigned to the perceptual areas more frequently encountering
797 samples. Transferring this weighting knowledge from trained areas to untrained areas (e.g., in
798 the NL test) or from more trained areas to less trained areas (e.g., in the ND test) in the stimulus
799 space would be less successful because these weighting representations are acquired with the
800 procedure-based learning system and tapped into the auditory cortex. In addition, sounds from
801 untrained perceptual areas may not be weighted the same way in the stimulus space as the
802 trained sounds, which may lead to incorrect categorization. This speculation is consistent with
803 our recent neuroimaging findings. Feng and colleagues (2021) examined the neural encodings
804 of II and RB auditory categories during categorization training. They found that auditory and
805 speech perception-related regions in the superior temporal cortex gradually increased the
806 weightings of perceptual information for II sounds. In contrast, the same regions gradually
807 decreased the perceptual representations for RB sounds. This putative perceptual weighting
808 mechanism of II representations requires further examination.
809 For the RB categories, DLS models may predict that changes in perceptual locations or
810 sample distributions in generalization would not affect categorization performances. However,
811 we found that categorizing RB sounds in generalization was affected by changes in
812 distributional patterns but not in locations of the perceptual space. These unexpected findings
813 are inconsistent with the prediction of DLS models and findings from recent studies (Maddox
814 et al., 2005; Roark and Holt, 2018). RB category representations have been considered an
815 abstract form of rules associated with executive functions and working memory capacity
816 (Waldron and Ashby, 2001; Zeithamova and Maddox, 2006; DeCaro et al., 2008; Reetzke et
817 al., 2016). Sample dispersity is not directly related to the execution of these functions. One
818 possibility of our findings is that the categorization rules are derived from the statistical
819 distribution of the training samples. Learners abstract the regularities of acoustic and perceptual
820 information from the distributional patterns of the samples via hypothesis-testing processes.
821 Transferring the sample-specific regularities to a new sample set with a significantly different
822 dispersity in the perceptual space would affect the categorization performances. Another
823 possibility may relate to the RB generalization mechanism. Dispersity of the samples relates to
824 the accuracy in computing the sound-to-boundary decision distance. More distributed sounds
28 / 43
825 within each category (i.e., the ND test) may cause a less accurate estimation of the decision
826 distance between each sound and a putative category bound. Therefore, the less accurate
827 bound-distance estimation may affect the categorization decision in the ND test compared to
828 the control test. This possibility assumes that the decision-distance estimation based on a
829 category bound is a necessary categorization process during generalization. This assumption is
830 supported by our representational similarity modeling results showing that the decision-
831 distance model significantly correlates with trial-by-trial category response confusions (see Fig.
832 S2 in supplementary). The model fits did not significantly change between generalization tests
833 (see Fig. 8), suggesting that the estimation of decision distance is a default step in
834 generalization. Future studies are needed to investigate the two possibilities systematically.
835 Regarding the training procedure, we did not find any significant differences in
836 generalization accuracy or representational model fit across the three experiments. In addition,
837 the training procedure did not affect the differences between II and RB in generalization
838 performances. These findings suggest that categorization tasks and providing immediate
839 feedback compared to the observation training may not additionally facilitate learning and
840 generalization accuracies for both category structures. In contrast to the generalization
841 accuracy and representation modeling, we found that categorization training with feedback (i.e.,
842 Exp. 2.2) facilitated learners’ categorization response time across generalization tests (Fig. S3
843 in supplementary), while this facilitation is not a tradeoff of categorization accuracies. These
844 findings indicate that categorization training with feedback may facilitate learners’
845 categorization decision processes, such as more efficiency in accumulating information for
846 category decisions compared to the observation training. Providing feedback and presenting
847 category labels may play a similar role for RB’s hypothesis-testing and II’s associative learning
848 processes, except that feedback-based training recruits reinforcement learning mechanisms to
849 learn sound-to-category mappings (Ashby and Maddox, 2005). The feedback-dependent
850 reinforcement learning may facilitate the formation of many-to-one corticostriatal projections
851 from the auditory and prefrontal cortex to the striatum regions (Chandrasekaran et al., 2014a,
852 2014b; Maddox and Chandrasekaran, 2014; Feng et al., 2021b). The reinforcement-based
853 mechanism may facilitate the retrieval of the category knowledge acquired during feedback-
854 based categorization training, thus enhancing the decision processing in categorization. More
855 investigations are needed to test this possibility.
857 Summary and conclusion
29 / 43
858 We examined the nature of II and RB auditory category representations by accessing the ability
859 of learners to generalize new category knowledge to novel testing situations. Four
860 generalization tests with various novel items were designed, and three category learning
861 experiments with different training procedures were conducted to compare the characteristics
862 of newly acquired II and RB category knowledge. II learners demonstrated decreased
863 generalization performance and category representation when generalizing to untrained
864 perceptual areas and in contexts with more dispersed samples; on the other hand, RB learners
865 showed resistance to changes in perceptual regions but sensitivity to increasing dispersity of
866 sounds. II and RB learners used different strategies for generalization when facing the more
867 variable context, with II learners enhancing representations of perceptual similarity and
868 decision distance while RB learners employed a more computational cost strategy to guide
869 categorization decisions. These findings shed light on the relationship between category
870 learning and representation nature and the varying strategies used by different learning and
871 representation systems to achieve successful generalization.
