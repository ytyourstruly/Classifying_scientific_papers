Abstract
47 Misinformation can negatively impact people’s lives in domains ranging from health to
48 politics. An important research goal is to understand how misinformation spreads in order to
49 curb it. Here, we test whether and how a single repetition of misinformation fuels its spread.
50 Over two experiments (N = 260) participants indicated which statements they would like to
51 share with other participants on social media. Half of the statements were repeated and half
52 were new. The results reveal that participants were more likely to share statements they had
53 previously been exposed to. Importantly, the relationship between repetition and sharing was
54 mediated by perceived accuracy. That is, repetition of misinformation biased people’s
55 judgement of accuracy and as a result fuelled the spread of misinformation. The effect was
56 observed in the domain of health (Exp 1) and general knowledge (Exp 2), suggesting it is
57 domain general.

Introduction
93 Engagement with misinformation online has doubled in recent years. Misinformation about
94 COVID-19, for example, proliferated over the last year with 1.1 million articles containing
95 misinformation about COVID-19 shared on social media (Evanega et al., 2020). Such growth
96 has concerning consequences including the increase of vaccines hesitancy, polarization, violent
97 extremism and racism (Rapp & Salovich, 2018; Tsfati et al., 2020; Barreto et al., 2021; Swire-
98 Thompson & Lazer, 2019; Newman et al., 2022). For instance, misleading information on how
99 to treat COVID-19 can lead to delays in properly treating patients. To halt the spread of
100 misinformation it is crucial to identify the mechanisms facilitating its spread. Here, we ask
101 whether and how a single previous exposure to misinformation alters the likelihood that it will
102 be shared.
103 A vast literature suggests that repeated statements are perceived as more accurate (Arkes et al.,
104 1991, 1989; Bacon, 1979; Begg et al., 1992; Hasher et al., 1977; Hawkins & Hoch, 1992; Law
105 et al., 1998; Roggeveen & Johar, 2002; Johar & Roggeveen, 2007; Begg at al., 1985; Begg &
106 Armourm, 1991; Brown & Nix, 1996; Doland, 1999; Gigerenzer, 1994; Hawkins, 2001; Law
107 & Hawkins, 1997; Schwart, 1982; Fazio et al., 2015; Swire et al., 2017; for a review Dechêne
108 et al., 2010) even when statements are from non-credible sources (Begg et al., 1992; Fazio et
109 al., 2019; Murray et al., 2020; Pennycook et al., 2018). This phenomenon is known as “The
110 Illusory Truth Effect” (Arkes et al., 1989; Murray et al., 2020; Fazio et al., 2019) and has been
111 shown in domains ranging from marketing (Hawkins & Hoch, 1992; Law et al., 1998;
112 Roggeveen & Johar, 2002; Johar & Roggeveen, 2007) to news (Murray et al., 2020; Pennycook
113 et al., 2018). A single previous exposure to missinformation can increase perceived accuracy
114 even when the information is inconsistent with the participant’s ideology (Pennycook et al.,
115 2018; Murray et al., 2020). Importantly, previous studies show that people tend to share more
116 accurate information than misinformation (Pennycook et al., 2021; Epstein et al., 2021;
117 Pennycook, McPhetres et al., 2020; Pennycook and Rand, 2022) and explicitly say they prefer
118 to do so (Pennycook et al., 2021; Epstein et al., 2021). Other factors can, and certainly do,
119 drive information-sharing (Pennycook et al., 2021; Chen, Pennycook, and Rand 2021; Van
120 Bavel and Pereira, 2018), for example - motivation. Nonetheless, accuracy is one driving
121 factor.
123 We pose that if (i) people on average tend to share information they believe is true more than
124 information they believe is false and (ii) repetition increases perceived accuracy, then repeated
125 information will be shared more than new information because people will believe it is accurate
126 (for similar theoretical prediction see Van Bavel et al., 2020 and Effron & Helgason, 2022).
128 We test this hypothesis within the domain of health and general knowledge. Misinformation in
129 these domains is commonplace and can have significant societal consequences. A few such
130 examples include the belief that the earth is flat (geography), that evolution is false (science),
131 that the holocaust never happened (history), that climate change is not men-made (science) and
132 that COVID vaccines are dangerous (health). Generalizing across a variety of domains is
133 important in showing the domain-generality of the effect. This is critical for both theory and
134 practice.
136 Previous attempts to test similar hypothesis focused specifically on sharing of political
137 information (Fazio, 2020; Effron & Raj, 2020). Political beliefs are known to be especially
138 influenced by motivation, and they are strongly tied to self-identity and are polarizing. These
139 factors will have a strong influence on information sharing, which may overshadow the effect
140 of repetition. In other words, within the political domain the effect size of repetition on sharing
141 may be smaller, which may explain why within this domain mixed results have been observed
142 (Fazio, 2020; Effron & Raj, 2020).
144 Here, we run an information-sharing task in which participants indicated whether they would
145 like to share health-related statements (Exp 1) and general knowledge statements (Exp 2) with
146 other participants on social media. Half of the statements were repeated, and half were new. In
147 addition, participants indicated whether they perceived each statement as true of false. This
148 allowed us to test whether repetition increases belief in accuracy, even when statements are
149 false, leading to increased sharing of misinformation.
Methods
153 Participants
155 £7.50 per hour for their participation. The task was created using Gorilla Experiment Builder
157 The sample size for was determined based on previous studies on the truth effect (Dechêne et
158 al., 2010). The study was approved by the departmental ethics committee at UCL. 162 subjects
159 participated in Exp 1. Data from one subject was eliminated as they completed one phase of
160 the experiment twice and data from one subject failed to save correctly. Thus, data from 160
161 participants was analyzed in Exp 1 (44 males, 115 females, 1 prefer not to say/other; mean age
162 = 35.26 years ± 11.05 (SD)). 102 subjects participated in Exp 2. Data from two subjects was
163 eliminated as they completed one phase of the experiment. Thus, data from 100 subject was
164 analyzed (53 males, 45 females, 2 other; mean age = 32.81 years ± 8.99 (SD)).
165 A post hoc Power Analysis performed on the main effect of repetition (Partial Eta Squared:
166 Exp1: 0.071; Exp2: 0.099, Sample size: Exp1: 160; Exp2: 100; Numerator df = 1; Number of
167 groups = 2) on sharing intentions revealed (using G*Power) an achieved power of 0.93 for Exp
168 1 and 0.90 in Exp 2 (α=0.05).
169 Procedure – Exp 1
170 In block 1, participants observed 30 health-related statements (selected from the Internet – see
171 supplement material for more information) in random order, each for 6 seconds. Statements
172 were randomly selected for each participant from a list of 60 (see supplement material for all
173 statements). Half of the statements were true and half were false.
175 In either the second or third block (counterbalanced across participants) participants observed
176 60 statements (half were new, half repeated) one at a time, in a random order. For each, they
177 indicated whether they wanted to share the statement with participants who might complete a
178 similar task the following day. They did so using a continuous scale ranging from 1 “Not at
179 all” to 100 “Very much”, self-paced.
181 In either the second block or third block (counter balanced across participants), participants
182 indicated whether they thought each statement was true or false on a continuous scale ranging
183 from 1 “Definitely False” to 100 “Definitely True” (Accuracy Judgment Block). Sentences
184 were presented in a random order. This was self-paced.
186 In Exp 1, 77 participants completed the Accuracy Judgment Block first, and 83 completed the
187 Information-Sharing Block first.
189 Attention Check: In block 1 four attention check were included. In two of these trials
190 participants observed a statement (which was not drawn from the 60 statements list) and
191 subsequently were presented with a list of three statements which included the one they
192 previously saw. Their task was to indicate the previously seen statement. In the other two trials,
193 after the presentation of the statement (which was not drawn from the 60 statements list),
194 participants were asked to answer a question about the statement they had just seen.
196 In block 2 and 3, six attention check trials were inserted. Four of these trials were identical to
197 check trials in block 1. In the other two trials, instead of indicating their sharing decision or
198 accuracy judgment, subjects were instructed to select a specific rating (for example: Select
199 Definitely False). In Exp 1, selecting one to ten was considered correct on this attention check.
200 Participants answered correctly on 89.22% of the attention checks in Exp 1.
202 Between block 1 and the block 2, participants filled questions about their social-media use.
203 After completing the study, participants filled the BES (Basic Empathy Scale).
206 Procedure – Exp 2
207 The task was identical to the task used in Exp 1, with three exceptions
208 (i) Information was ‘general knowledge’.
209 (ii) Participants indicated their answers on a six-point Likert scale.
210 (iii) The sharing scenario was hypothetical. Participants were told they had to manage a
211 Twitter account that specialize in general knowledge. In the information-sharing
212 block, they indicated whether they wanted to share the statement on their
213 hypothetical Twitter account.
215 57 participants completed the Accuracy Judgment Block first, and 43 completed the
216 Information-Sharing Block first. Participants answered correctly on 80.75% of the attention
217 checks.
219 Most of the work on The Illusory Truth Effect has been done previously on general knowledge
220 statements (for example: Arkes et al., 1989; Fazio et al., 2015; Brashier et al., 2020; Newman
221 et al., 2020; Bacon, 1979; Begg et al., 1992; Hasher et al., 1977; Doland, 1999; Swire et al.,
222 2017). In Exp 1, we used the same exact statements used in these previous studies (Arkes et
223 al., 1989; Fazio et al., 2015; Brashier et al., 2020; Newman et al., 2020). General knowledge
224 statements in Exp 1 included a broad range of facts about science (19 statements), geography
225 (14 statements), sport (10 statements), food (7 statements), culture (5 statements), literature (3
226 statements) and history (2 statements) (see the Supplementary Materials).
228 The reason we asked participants to imagine they have an account related to health (Exp 1) or
229 general knowledge (Exp 2) was that if we asked them to imagine their own account they may
230 not share any statements at all, thus it would be impossible to examine the hypotheses. The
231 reason they might not share anything at all is that people usually have accounts in which they
232 share information from specific domains. For example, academics tend to posts about academia
233 and science.
236 Analysis
238 We run two linear mixed model for each experiment, one predicting sharing decisions and the
239 other predicting perceived accuracy. Repetition (repeated/new) and ground truth
240 (true/misinformation) and their interactions were modelled as fixed and random effect.
241 Random and fixed intercepts were also included.
243 We also run linear mixed effect models separately for true information and misinformation
244 predicting perceived accuracy and sharing from repetition (repeated/new) only. When running
245 the analysis on true information only, data of one subject in Exp1 (for the perceived accuracy
246 model) and seven subjects in Exp2 (for the sharing model) caused the final Hessian matrix not
247 to be positive definite, producing inflated degrees of freedom, due to lack of variability in their
248 data. These subjects were thus removed from those specific analyses. Note that not removing
249 the subjects leads to the same exact results but with inflated degrees of freedom.
251 To test the robustness of these results, for each subject we computed the average rating on the
252 sharing scale and the average rating on the perceived accuracy scale, separately for repeated
253 and new statements, and for true and false statements. A repeated measures ANOVA was
254 conducted with repetition (new/ repeated) and ground truth (true/ misinformation) as within
255 subject variables, and perceived accuracy as the dependent variable. The same ANOVA was
256 conducted also with sharing ratings as the dependent variable.
258 We then performed a mediation analysis for each participant, using the R package Process 4.0
259 with 10000 permutations, to test whether perceived accuracy mediated the effect of repetition
260 on sharing decision. Significance of the mediation was determined by the Index of indirect
261 effect. We could not estimate the mediation model for 1 subject in Exp 1 and 7 in Exp 2 due to
262 non-sufficient variability in responses (that is subjects either made the exact same sharing
263 response on all trials and/or used only two numbers on the accuracy scale). Therefore, the
264 mediation model was estimated for 159 participants in Exp 1 and for 93 in Exp. The total effect
265 cannot be estimated when subjects used only two numbers on the sharing scale, this was true
266 for 6 subjects in Exp 2. Estimates were compared to 0 across participants using a T-test.
Results
271 Task. Exp 1: To investigate whether, and why, repeated information is shared more than new
273 of trials, they indicated whether they would like to share health-related statements (e.g., ‘For
274 better health, one needs to remove sugar entirely from one’s diet’) with participants who may
275 be completing a similar task on the following day. Half of the statements were true and half
276 were false (see supplementary material for full instructions).
278 Half of the statements (randomly assigned) were previously presented to the participants and
279 half were new. On another block of trials, participants rated whether they believed each
280 statement was true or false (accuracy judgment). The order of the sharing block and the
281 accuracy judgment block was counterbalanced across individuals.
286 from a list of 60. On the second or third block (counterbalanced) participants observed each of the 60
287 statements and indicated whether they would have liked to share the information with participants who
288 may be conducting a similar task the following day. They replied on a continuous scale ranging from 1
289 “Not at all” to 100 “Very much”. In the second or third block (counterbalanced), participants indicated
290 whether they believed each statement was true or false using a continuous scale ranging from 1
291 “Definitely False” to 100 “Definitely True”. Red color is used for illustrative purposes only.
293 Repeated information is perceived as more true. We first tested for the “Illusory truth effect”
294 - that is whether participants are more likely to perceive repeated information as true. To that
295 end we performed a linear mixed model predicting perceived accuracy. Ground truth
296 (true/misinformation) and repetition (repeated/new) and their interactions were modelled as
297 fixed and random effects. Random and fixed intercepts were also included. In accordance with
298 the literature on the “Illusory truth effect”, we found a main effect of repetition, such that
299 repeated statements were perceived as more accurate than new statements (β = -3.12, t(315.98)
301 misinformation (β = -33, t(251.78) =-29.88, p < 0.001). No other effects were significant. We
302 then run a linear mixed effect model predicting perceived accuracy from repetition, separately
303 for true information and misinformation. Random and fixed intercepts were also included.
304 Results suggest that repetition increases perceived accuracy both for true information (β = -
305 3.16, t(158.36) = -5.34 , p < 0.001) and misinformation (β = -4.39, t(159.503) = -4.46 , p <
306 0.001).

313 bars indicate SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
315 The above results are also observed when submitting average accuracy ratings for each
316 participant into a 2x2 repeated measures Anova with ground truth (true/misinformation) and
317 repetition (repeated/new) as within subject variables and perceived accuracy as the dependent
318 variable. Once again, we found a main effect of repetition - repeated statements (M = 60.51,
319 SD = 10.04) were rated as more true than new statements (M = 56.77, SD = 8.91; F(1,159) =
320 39.92, p < 0.001, = 0.201). This was found for both true statements (Repeated: M = 76.98,
321 SD = 8.96, New: M = 73.80, SD = 9.14, t(159) = 5.419, p < 0.001) and misinformation
322 (Repeated: M = 44.00, SD = 14.52, New: M = 39.62 SD = 12.36, t(159) = 4.482, p < 0.001).
323 Moreover, we found a main effect of ground truth - true information (M = 75.46, SD = 8.25)
324 was judged as more true than misinformation (M = 41.82, SD = 12.06; F(1,159) = 1222.202, p
325 < 0.001, = 0.885). No other effects were significant.
327 Repeated information is shared more than new information. Next, we tested whether
328 repeated statements were shared more than new statements. A linear mixed model predicting
329 sharing decisions was run with repetition (repeated, new), ground truth (true, misinformation)
330 and their interactions modelled as fixed and random effect. Random and fixed intercepts were
331 also included. The results revealed that repeated statements were shared more than new
334 other effects were significant. We then run linear mixed effect models predicting sharing from
335 repetition, separately for true information and misinformation. Random and fixed intercepts
336 were also included. Results suggest that repetition increases sharing both for true information
337 (β = -2.06, t(158.75) = -2.46 , p = 0.015) and misinformation (β = -2,00, t(158.51) = -2.46 , p
338 = 0.015).
344 to and are also more likely to share true information. Plotted are the Estimated Marginal Means from
345 the Linear Mixed Models Predicting Perceived Accuracy. Error bars indicate SEM. * p < 0.05, ** p <
346 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
349 We observe the same findings when performing a 2x2 repeated measures ANOVA with ground
350 truth (true/misinformation) and repetition (repeated/new) as within subject variables and
351 sharing decision as the dependent variable. Once again, we found a main effect of repetition:
352 people shared repeated statements (M = 41.03, SD = 20.16) more than new statement (M =
353 38.81, SD = 18.45; F(1,159) = 12.066, p = 0.001, = 0.071). This was observed both for true
354 statements (Repeated: M = 53.92, SD = 23.90, New: M = 51.88, SD = 22.34, t(159) = 2.437, p
355 = 0.016) and misinformation (Repeated: M = 27.78, SD = 19.27, New: M = 25.78 SD = 17.38,
356 t(159) = 2.478, p = 0.014). There was also a main effect of ground truth; people share true
357 statements (M = 53.02, SD = 22.58) more than misinformation (M = 26.83, SD = 17.78;
358 F(1,159) = 475.925, p < 0.001 , = 0.750). No other effects were significant.
360 The effect of repetition on sharing is fully mediated by perceived accuracy. So far, we
361 found that repeated information is more likely to be shared by participants than new
362 information. A possible underlying mechanism is that repetition boosts perceived accuracy,
363 which in turn leads to greater sharing. To test this possibility, we performed a mediation
364 analysis for each participant and tested the obtained estimates against zero. We found that
365 repetition was related to greater sharing (Total effect = 2.23, SD = 8.71, t(158) = 3.235, p =
367 by perceived accuracy (Index of indirect effect = 2.45, SD = 6.42, t(158) = 4.814, p < 0.001).
368 Specifically, repetition of information was associated with higher perceived accuracy (β = 3.71,
369 SD = 9.02, t(158) = 5.188, p < 0.001) and perceived accuracy was associated with greater
370 sharing (β = 0.62, SD = 0.32, t(158) = 24.25, p < 0.001). After accounting for perceived
371 accuracy the relation between repetition and sharing was not significant (β = -0.22, SD = 5.64,
372 t(158) = 0.485, p = 0.629).
379 represents the mediation model and the Beta Coefficients obtained. *** p < 0.001.
381 Exp 2: Results are domain general. So far, we found that repetition leads to increased
382 information sharing of health-related information. Next, we examined whether the results
383 would generalize to information related to different domains. To that end, 100 participants
384 completed the same task as in Exp 1 except that the information was ‘general knowledge’ (e.g.,
385 ‘The Cyclops is the legendary one-eyed giant in Greek mythology’). Statements included were
386 from the following domains: science (19 statements), geography (14 statements), sport (10
387 statements), food (7 statements), culture (5 statements), literature (3 statements), and history (2
388 statements). All statements were extract from past studies on the illusory truth effect (Arkes et
389 al., 1989; Fazio et al., 2015; Brashier et al., 2020; Newman et al., 2020).
391 There were two other differences between Exp 2 and Exp 1: (i) instead of being told that they
392 would be deciding which information to share with participants that may be completing the
393 task the next day, participants were told that they were managing a social media page about
394 general knowledge, and they had to decide which information they would like to post. (ii) We
395 used a 6-point Likert scale for all ratings.
397 The analysis was exactly as in Exp 1. Replicating previous results, the mixed linear model
398 revealed that repeated statements were perceived as more accurate (β = -0.19, t (247.941) = -
401 other effects were significant. Separate mixed linear models on true and misinformation
402 separately showed that repetition increases perceived accuracy both for true information (β = -
403 0.19, t(98.59) = -2.94 , p = 0.004) and misinformation (β = -0.24, t(99.208) = -3.58 , p = 0.001).
405 As in Exp1, results of the ANOVA were in accord with the mixed model - repeated statements
406 (M = 3.97, SD = 0.57) were rated as more true than new statements (M = 3.75, SD = 0.37;
407 F(1,99) = 15.949 p < 0.001, = 0.139). This was observed for both true statements (Repeated:
408 M = 4.59, SD = 0.58, New: M = 4.40, SD = 0.46, t(99) = 2.842, p = 0.005) and misinformation
409 (Repeated: M = 3.34, SD = 0.72, New: M = 3.11 SD = 0.52, t(99) = 3.498, p = 0.001).
410 Moreover, true information (M = 4.49, SD = 0.40) was judged as more true than misinformation
411 (M = 3.22, SD = 0.53; F(1,99) = 541.264, p < 0.001, = 0.845). No other effects were
412 significant.
414 As for sharing, again the mixed model revealed that repeated statements were shared more than
416 information was shared more than misinformation (β = -0.68, t (154.46) = -8.99, p < 0.001;
418 from repetition, separately for true information and misinformation show that repetition
419 increased sharing both for true information (β = -0.15, t(91.92) = -2.83 , p = 0.006) and
420 misinformation (β = -0.12, t(99.44) = -2.26 , p = 0.026).
422 A repeated measures ANOVA confirmed the results. People shared repeated statements (M =
423 2.43, SD = 0.95) more than new statements (M = 2.30, SD = 0.86; F(1,99) = 10.886, p = 0.001,
424 = 0.099). This was observed for both true statements (Repeated: M = 2.77, SD = 1.16, New:
425 M = 2.62, SD = 1.06, t(99) = 3.139, p = 0.002) and misinformation (Repeated: M = 2.10, SD
426 = 0.87, New: M = 1.97 SD = 0.78, t(99) = 2.233, p = 0.028).They also shared true statements
427 (M = 2.70, SD = 1.08) more than misinformation (M = 2.03, SD = 0.78; F(1,99) = 94.482, p <
428 0.001, = 0.488). No other effects were significant.
430 As in Exp 1, repetition was related to increase sharing (Total effect = 0.16, SD = 0.47, t(86) =
432 (Index of indirect effect = 0.12, SD = 0.37, t(92) = 3.070, p = 0.003). Specifically, repetition
433 was related to higher perceived accuracy (β = 0.23, SD =0.57, t(92) = 3.820, p < 0.001) which
434 in turn was associated with greater sharing (β = 0.46, SD =0.36, t(92) = 12.393, p < 0.001).
435 Once again, after accounting for perceived accuracy the relation between repetition and sharing
436 was not significant (β = 0.16, SD = 1.47, t(92) = 1.056, p = 0.294).
443 predicting perceived accuracy show that repeated information is perceived as more accurate than new
444 information. (b) Estimated marginal means from the linear mixed models predicting sharing show that
445 people share repeated information more than new. Error bars indicate SEM. (c) Perceived accuracy

Discussion
452 Here, we provide evidence for a mechanism which facilitates the spread of misinformation. In
453 particular, we demonstrate that the well-known ‘illusory truth effect’ fuels the spread of
454 misinformation. It has been suggested that a single exposure to repeated information boosts its
455 accuracy perception (for a review Dechêne et al., 2010) – here we show that by doing so it also
456 boosts the spread of said information.
458 Specifically, our data reveal that people are more likely to share information they have been
459 previously exposed to. We show that the relationship between repetition and sharing is
460 mediated by perceived accuracy. That is, repeated information seems to be shared more
461 because people judge repeated information as more accurate. Our results help explain why fake
462 news spread so easily among the population. Fake-new is often constructed to be appealing to
463 the reader and consequently is more likely to be repeated by different sources (Vosoughi et al.,
464 2918). Results of our study suggest that repeated exposure to misinformation will create a
465 vicious circle in which misinformation will be perceived as true and therefore shared more.
466 These results stress the importance of quickly tagging misinformation as such. If repeated
467 exposure biases people to share news more, the longer information circulates, the higher the
468 probability that it will be considered as true and further shared with others.
470 Importantly, repetition increased sharing intentions in different domains. We show that the
471 results replicate for health-related information as well as ‘general knowledge’, suggesting that
472 the effect of repetition on information-sharing is domain general.
474 In sum, we show that even a single previous exposure to information will increase the
475 likelihood of sharing by enhancing perceived accuracy. This will create a viscous cycle of
476 exposure – increase belief – sharing – exposure - increase belief - which in turn can influence
477 actions. For example, misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines can increases vaccine
478 hesitancy and as a result reduce the likelihood of vaccine uptake.
