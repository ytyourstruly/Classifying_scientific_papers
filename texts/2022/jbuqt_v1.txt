1 Abstract
Unavoidable stress elicits perceived lack of controllability and learned helplessness, which is a
risk-factor for depression. Stress, anxiety, and depression can all alter reward learning. In a
preregistered study during the first-wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, we used self-reported
measures of depression, anxiety, uncontrollable stress, and COVID-19 risk from 427 online
participants to predict performance in a three-armed-bandit probabilistic reward learning task.
As hypothesised, uncontrollable stress predicted impaired learning of optimal choices.
Uncontrollable stress also predicted a greater proportion of probabilistic errors following
negative feedback for correct choices, which reflected interpretation of ambiguous negative
feedback as a change in task reward contingencies. Moreover, this effect of uncontrollable stress
on probabilistic errors was mediated by state anxiety. A parameter from the best-fitting hidden
Markov model that estimates expected beliefs that the identity of the optimal choice will shift
across images, mediated effects of state anxiety on probabilistic errors and learning deficits. Our
findings show that following uncontrollable stress, anxiety promotes an overly volatile
representation of the reward structure of uncertain environments, impairing reward attainment,
which is a potential path to anhedonia in depression.
To obtain rewards successfully from their complex, ever-changing environments, people flexibly
learn to adapt behaviour based on prior experience (Daw et al., 2005; O’Doherty et al., 2017;
Sutton & Barto, 2018). Better than expected outcomes elicit positive prediction errors, while
worse than expected outcomes elicit negative prediction errors, thus updating estimated action
values to support optimal choices (Rigoli et al., 2016; Schultz, 2016; Schultz et al., 1997). Stress
can interfere with this learning process, damaging reward maximization (Berghorst et al., 2013;
Carvalheiro et al., 2021a; 2021b; de Berker et al., 2016; Morgado et al., 2015; Pizzagalli, 2014;
Starcke & Brand, 2012; Voulgaropoulou et al., 2021) and impairing avoidance of aversive
outcomes (Raio et al., 2017). For example, anticipating threat of shock impairs performance in
probabilistic reward learning tasks (Bogdan et al., 2011; Bogdan & Pizzagalli, 2006; Paret &
Bublatzky, 2020), and acute stress dampens neural activation associated with reward sensitivity
in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsal striatum (Porcelli et al., 2012). However,
whether stress is perceived to be controllable (i.e., avoidable upon one's action; Ligneul, 2021)
may determine the extent of these cognitive consequences (Ly et al., 2019; Maier & Seligman,
2016). Here, we ask whether self-reported stress uncontrollability impairs learning to make
17 choices to optimise reward.
When actions result in desired outcomes, a subjective sense of controllability or agency over the
environment leads to exploration and goal-directed action (Karsh & Eitam, 2015; Ly et al., 2019;
Moscarello & Hartley, 2017). It is thought that expectations regarding controllability are
predicted by generalising from experiences in similar contexts (Hiroto & Seligman, 1975; Huys &
Dayan, 2009; Leider et al., 2013). Expected controllability elicits a shift from spectator models —
that make inferences about the environment by linking passive past and future states — to
active models that include one’s own actions as predictors of outcomes (Ligneul et al., 2022).
Actively avoiding aversive stimuli fosters resilience and protects against later unavoidable
aversive stimulation, which is thought to arise via vmPFC inhibiting subcortical stress and pain
circuits (e.g., amygdala, striatum, and insula) in both animals (Amat et al., 2005; 2010; Baratta et
al., 2008; 2009; Maier et al., 2006; Maier & Watkins, 2005; Maier & Seligman, 2016) and humans
(Cohodes et al., 2022; Cremers et al., 2021; Limbachia et al., 2021; Kerr et al., 2012; Meine et al.,
2021; Salomons et al., 2004; Wade-Bohleber et al., 2021; Wang & Delgado, 2021; Wood et al.,
2015). Moreover, in humans, actively avoiding stressors promotes Stroop conflict resolution
(Henderson et al., 2012), greater fear attenuation, quicker fear extinction (Hartley et al., 2014;
Wanke & Schwabe, 2020), and less subjective pain than experiencing uncontrollable aversive
stimuli of the same intensity (Wiech et al., 2006). When actions do not lead to desired
35 controllable
consequences, a sense of uncontrollability leads to reflexive, passive behaviour and learned
helplessness (a failure to attempt to avoid stressors in new contexts; Hiroto &
Seligman, 1975; Maier & Seligman, 2016; Moscarello & Hartley, 2017). Animals experiencing
uncontrollable stress show deactivation of vmPFC, and activation of the stress-related neural
structures listed above (Maier & Seligman, 2016; Datta & Arnsten, 2019). Moreover, in humans,
deactivation of vmPFC during uncontrollable stress predicts greater subjective helplessness
(Meine et al., 2021), which is thought to be a risk factor for development and maintenance of
42 depression (Pryce et al., 2011; Maier & Seligman, 2016).
Here, we seek to examine in more detail the effect of uncontrollable stress on learning from
rewards. Given the contribution of stress (Hammen, 2005; 2015; Pizzagalli, 2014) and
uncontrollability (MacAulay et al., 2014), to aspects of depression, an obvious parallel for this
study are the substantial observations about the effects on learning from rewards in depression,
where it is sometimes (Bishop & Gagne, 2018; Chen et al., 2015; Pizzagalli, 2014; Robinson et al.,
2012), but not always (Huys et al. 2013; Moutoussis et al., 2018; Rutledge et al., 2017) found to
be impaired. For the case of depression, there have been substantial efforts to dissociate
different sources of problems with reward learning, namely issues with reward processing;
biases or deficits in the learned associations between stimuli and/or actions and rewards; the
consequences of such associations for motivated decision-making; or, more subtly, an inability
to adapt behaviour appropriately to the statistical demands of the environment. For an example
of the complexities, anhedonia, which refers to a blunted emotional response to usually
pleasurable events, is a cardinal symptom of depression. However, rather than an inability to
experience pleasure from primary reinforcers (e.g., sweet tastes; Dichter et al., 2010), which
would constitute a problem with reward processing, anhedonia is associated with lowered
expected values of actions, pessimistic prior beliefs, and reduced motivation and effort (the last
of which can predict depression relapse in patients who are remitted; Berwian et al., 2020). One
of the more robust findings in both depression and state and trait anxiety is a disruption to
reward learning coming from dysfunctional behavioural adjustments to environmental statistics
(e.g., Aylward et al., 2019; Bishop & Gagne, 2018; Browning et al., 2015; Hein et al., 2021; Gagne
et al., 2020; Pike & Robinson, 2022; Xia et al., 2021). Statistics such as the volatility of beneficial
or malignant circumstances play a critical role in determining learning. Problems arise from
such things as an expectation that reward, even if currently available, will likely be short-lived,
or that a punishment represents a systematic and stable characteristic of the environment,
21 rather than just an unlucky sample.
In this preregistered study, we ask whether uncontrollable stress is associated with impaired
reward learning and examine possible computational mechanisms by which this might arise.
The COVID-19 pandemic presented a context of environmental volatility, with naturally varying
subjective responses across individuals (e.g., Salari et al., 2020; Shah et al., 2021). During the
first-wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, 427 online participants self-reported levels
of stress (perceived uncontrollable stress and lack of self-efficacy; Cohen et al., 1983);
depressive symptoms (Kroenke et al., 2001); state and trait anxiety (Spielberger, 1980; 2010);
and perceived risk of COVID-19 (Wise et al., 2020). We initially used Exploratory Factor Analysis
(EFA) to derive latent factor scores within and across the questionnaires to examine how these
31 n
factors predicted reward learning task performance. However, these factor scores were not
reliable within a subset of participants ( = 49, measured across two sessions approximately
three days apart). Therefore, we deviated from the preregistration and instead used
confirmatory latent factor models based on previously established subscales to obtain reliable
35 weighted factor scores.
All participants performed two versions of a probabilistic reward learning three-armed bandit
reward. On each trial, participants chose one of three vertical columns comprising three images.
Images in each horizontal row were from the same class (landscape; mode of transport; animal);
but the pictures in these rows shuffled randomly on each trial, leaving constant the vertical
order of the image classes. On any given trial, just one of the images (e.g., a cat) was the target.
Participants had to learn by accumulating evidence from their composite choices. Participants
first completed the “signalled” task in which they were informed that each new game of 25 trials
indicated that the target image had changed. If they chose the composite stimulus that included
the target, they had a 75% chance of receiving a point (1 penny in Great British Pounds/GBP). If
they chose a non-target composite, reward probability was 25%. Participants then completed
the reversal task, which was similar to the signalled task except that it comprised one
continuous game in which the target changed without warning every 20-30 trials (a fact that
was communicated to participants). The same images were used for both tasks. The reversal
task was more difficult, because receiving no reward could indicate either probabilistic negative
feedback, or a target reversal. We therefore increased reward probability upon choosing the
target to 80% (20% for non-targets). Participants were informed about reward probabilities for
7 both tasks.
We expected that uncontrollable stress would predict impaired learning in both tasks. To
examine possible cognitive mechanisms by which uncontrollable stress might impact reward
learning, we compared different computational models that were fit to the participants’ choices.
The models included preregistered variations of reinforcement learning models (RLMs), which
estimate the values of choices on each trial, and update these values based on whether the
outcome is better or worse than expected (i.e., reward prediction errors). We compared the fit of
simulated choices from each model to the actual data, and then examined whether our factors
that predicted impaired learning in the task also predicted estimated parameters from the
winning model. We expected that uncontrollable stress would decrease learning rate for positive
prediction errors in both tasks, while not affecting reward sensitivity. We expected that
uncontrollable stress would increase the learning rate for negative prediction errors in the
reversal task (in which negative feedback is more ambiguous), but not in the signalled task. The
RLM models turned out to fit choices in the reversal task rather poorly. Thus, we also included
an exploratory (not preregistered) hidden Markov model (HMM) in which the hidden state is the
identity of the target image. Inference in the HMM involves tracking the probability of each
possible target (i.e., each possible hidden state) based on rewards obtained after each choice. As
the exploratory HMM was a markedly better fit to the data than the RLMs, we explored
relationships between our factors and the HMM parameters (i.e., the probability that a reward is
observed when the target is chosen; the probability that a non-reward outcome is observed
when a non-target is chosen; and the probability that the target identity will shift to another
28 image on the next trial).
30 Participants saw a fixation cross for 500 ms, followed by the image stimuli until a response was made,
31 or for 2000 ms if they failed to respond in time. Participants selected one of the three vertical
32 composite stimuli (comprising one landscape, one animal, and one mode of transport) on each trial
33 using the arrow keys (left, down, right). Reward feedback followed for 1000 ms, showing a star on
34 reward trials, and a cross on no reward trials, along with the chosen composite stimulus. If no
35 response was made, an image of a clock was shown to remind participants to respond more quickly.
2 Results
The 427 participants completed 69 items across four questionnaires (see Materials and
Methods): the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS, Cohen et al., 1983; 1994); the State Trait Anxiety
Inventory (STAI, Spielberger, 1980; 2010) the Risk of COVID-19 Scale (Wise et al., 2020); and the
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression scale (PHQ-9, Kroenke et al., 2001). Because we
expected considerable overlap in the measured constructs, we used exploratory factor analysis
(EFA) to identify latent factors present within and across the scales to include as fixed-effects in
our analyses. EFA is a data-driven approach that reduces dimensionality and produces weighted
scores comprising items which can come from different scales (e.g., Costello & Osborne, 2005).
The clearest, most meaningful, yet parsimonious structure was a seven-factor model (see
Materials and Methods for model selection details) comprising: Uncontrollable Stress;
Depression; State Anxiety; Trait Anxiety; Anxiety (reverse-coded positively-framed items from
both State and Trait scales); Perceived Likelihood of COVID-19 Risk; and Perceived Severity of
18 COVID-19 Risk.
However, assessing test-retest reliability for the 49 participants who completed the scales again
three days later showed that these EFA scores were not reliable within individuals (Intraclass
Fleiss, 1979). This lack of reliability was surprising considering that the sum scores for each
established scale and subscale showed good test-retest reliability (ICC range: 0.75 to 0.95).
However, using sum scores is not recommended, so we deviated from the preregistration and
used congeneric factor analysis, a confirmatory factor model (McNeish & Wolf, 2020), to
produce weighted scores based on the structure of previously established scales and subscales.

determined the following factor structure: Uncontrollable Stress; Lack of Self-efficacy;
Depression; Perceived of COVID-19 Risk; Perceived of COVID-19 Risk; State
Anxiety (negatively-framed items), State Anxiety (positively-framed items), Trait Anxiety
(negatively-framed items), and Trait Anxiety (positively-framed items). Unlike the EFA factor
scores, these congeneric scores were test-retest reliable across the two sessions (ICC range: 0.75

For the 49 participants who completed the probabilistic reward learning tasks twice, test-retest
reliability for overall task performance (mean proportion correct) was low, which is not
unexpected based on recent examinations of test-retest reliability for tasks that produce robust
and replicable effects (Enkavi et al., 2019; Hedge et al., 2018). These cognitive tasks typically have
low between-subject variability, which goes hand-in-hand with low reliability for individual
10 ICC p CI
differences (Hedge et al., 2018). Using intraclass correlation (ICC) models, test-retest mean overall
11 ICC p CI
accuracy performance was (48, 48) = 0.26, = .032, = 0.31-0.47 for the reversal task, and
(48, 48) = 0.18, = .093, = -0.42-0.38 for the signalled task. Although low test-retest
reliability suggests that our task may be less suited to study individual variability and may result
in underestimation of effect sizes, our ability to detect significant effects is enhanced by our

To examine which factors affected learning, separately for the signalled and reversal tasks, we
ran preregistered generalised logistic mixed-models (GLMMs) on accuracy (0, 1), with Trial
(centred around 0) as a fixed-effect, and by-subject random intercepts and slopes for Trial, thus
allowing for between-subject learning variability. We systematically added Factor Score x Trial
interactions as fixed-effects and then as random-effects in separate models for each of the nine
factors. Adding random-effect interaction terms did not significantly improve fit of any of the
models. We note that in the preregistration we planned to use factor scores from the EFA, but
24 because of low reliability we use factor scores from the confirmatory factor models.

Importantly, as predicted in our preregistration, an Uncontrollable Stress x Trial interaction
supported our key hypothesis that perceived lack of stress controllability would be associated
with impaired reward learning. We found no significant effects of positively-framed State
Anxiety on learning, so we now refer to negatively-framed State Anxiety simply as State Anxiety.
State Anxiety significantly predicted lower accuracy, and impaired learning (a State Anxiety x
Trial interaction). With a correction for multiple comparisons (Holm, 1979) only the State
Trial interaction did not survive the Holm correction, it supported our key preregistered and

For both tasks, we performed preregistered multiple linear regressions examining how the nine
factors predicted learning speed (number of trials to learning defined by a preregistered
criterion of 5 consecutive correct trials). We expected that Uncontrollable Stress would be
associated with slower learning. However, none of the factors predicted slower learning in

We performed preregistered linear regressions examining how the nine factors predicted the
proportion of probabilistic errors. The proportion of probabilistic errors was the ratio of the
number of times participants made an erroneous shift away from a correctly chosen learned
target after receiving probabilistic negative feedback, to the total number of times they received
probabilistic negative feedback. In other words, probabilistic errors are the proportion of times
participants shift away from choosing a learned target following negative feedback for a correct
response, suggesting pre-emptive anticipation of a target reversal. This measure is evidently not
meaningful for the signalled task. Not all participants had the opportunity to commit
probabilistic errors as some never experienced probabilistic negative feedback after meeting the
learning criterion of five consecutive correct trials. This reduced the sample size for this analysis
to 393. The 34 excluded participants were less accurate overall (mean proportion correct =
0.329, compared to 0.535 for the included participants), and so the sample included in the
8 probabilistic error analyses is skewed towards more accurate participants.
We found that Uncontrollable Stress, State Anxiety (negatively-framed), and State Anxiety
(positively-framed) all significantly positively predicted a greater proportion of probabilistic

2 C omputational Modelling
To examine possible cognitive mechanisms underlying effects of Uncontrollable Stress and State
Anxiety on choices, we assessed the ability of a range of models from two families to capture
trial-by-trial data (see Materials and Methods). The first family of models includes preregistered
variations of classical reinforcement learning models (RLMs) in which actions are learned
through reward prediction errors and the Rescorla Wagner updating rule. However, because the
RLMs were rather incompetent at explaining the observed choices, we deviated from the

hidden state because it cannot be observed directly, but only indirectly through reward feedback
after each choice. On each trial, the HMM estimates the probability that each of the nine images
is the target given the choices and the outcome of the trial and uses this to calculate the
posterior distribution over the hidden state. This likelihood is calculated differently for chosen
10 q
and unchosen images and is dependent on two free parameters representing: the model's
expected probability that a reward is observed when the chosen stimulus includes the target ( );
12 p p
and the model's expected probability that a non-reward outcome is observed when the chosen
stimulus does not include the target ( ). We note that the distribution of was highly skewed
14 q
towards 1, which is too high given that notional expected probability of not obtaining a reward
when non-target stimuli are chosen was 0.8. By contrast, the distribution of was relatively
normal but underestimated the true probability of obtaining a reward after selecting a target.
After updating, the hidden states are multiplied by a transition matrix characterizing the
subjective probabilistic relationship between the hidden state on the current trial and that on
the next trial. This transition matrix is parameterized by a third free parameter, assuming that
20 tr
any new target is chosen uniformly amongst the eight other images. More formally, the off-
diagonal entries of this transition matrix are set to be the transition parameter ( ) divided by 8.
The diagonal entries are defined as 1 minus that free parameter and describe the probability
that the target image remains the same on the next trial.

and was =.124, =.010 ( value uncorrected for multiple comparisons). No other correlations
were significant. These results suggest that anxiety is associated with an increased tendency to
believe that the target identity will change, shifting interpretation of negative feedback towards
a change in reward contingencies rather than being due to chance. This is in line with higher
4 tr
anxiety being associated with a higher proportion of probabilistic errors. To test this hypothesis,
we ran two exploratory mediation analyses with State Anxiety as the treatment variable and

8 n p

( =393, =.013). The above findings show that anxiety is associated with impaired reward
learning via a propensity to anticipate changes to reward contingencies, an effect which depends
11 on expected beliefs about environmental voDliastciluitsys. i on
Self-reported uncontrollable stress and state anxiety together predicted impaired performance
in a probabilistic reversal reward learning task in which participants learned from the outcomes
of their choices to maximise rewards. Both uncontrollable stress and anxiety were associated
with a propensity to commit probabilistic errors, reflecting pre-emptive anticipation of target
reversals. Comparing simulated choices from different Reinforcement Learning Models (RLMs)
18 tr
to that of a hidden Markov model (HMM) showed that the HMM was a markedly better fit to
participants’ choices. The parameter from the HMM estimates expected beliefs that the
20 tr
identity of the target image will shift from trial-to-trial, hence parametrizing a belief regarding
environmental volatility. The parameter mediated effects of state anxiety on reward learning
and probabilistic error proportions. Together, our findings suggest that experiencing
uncontrollable stress and anxiety are associated with an overly volatile representation of the
reward structure of the environment, shifting interpretation of probabilistic negative feedback
towards a change in reward contingencies rather than being due to chance. This shift impairs
reward learning in the relatively ambiguous context of the reversal task but not the signalled
27 task.
We did not expect the lack of effects in the signalled task, but it is concordant with the
importance of probabilistic errors in driving the observed effects on reward learning.
Probabilistic errors only play a role in the reversal task as negative feedback is not ambiguous in
the signalled task. In both tasks, an element of first-order uncertainty arises from the
probabilistic nature of the reward structure (80/75% chance of reward for choosing the target,
20/25% otherwise in the reversal and signalled tasks, respectively). A second-order source of
uncertainty is related to the volatility of the environment and differs between tasks. In both
tasks there were frequent changes to the reward contingencies (i.e., target reversals) but while
their timing was known in the signalled task, they occurred silently in the reversal task. This
rendered negative feedback as ambiguous in the reversal task, as it could be the result of the
first-order uncertainty present in both tasks or could be a sign that the target image had
changed. Accordingly, it is commonly observed that non-signalled and rapidly-changing reward
contingencies reduce confidence in one’s value estimations, giving more weight to unexpected
outcomes and increasing learning rates (Behrens et al. 2007, Browning et al. 2015). Thus, rather
than simply impairing the ability of learning the value of actions from positive feedback,
perceived uncontrollable stress and subsequent anxiety may interfere with the ability to flexibly
unlearn and relearn the values of actions in the more volatile and ambiguous context of the
reversal task.
We used computational modelling to examine possible cognitive mechanisms that might
underpin these effects. Our preregistered RLMs did not adequately capture participants’ choices
in the reversal task. Although we expected that RLMs with fixed learning rates would not
recapitulate participants’ choices in the relatively ambiguous reversal task (Behrens et al., 2007;
Bartolo & Averbeck 2020; Mathys et al., 2014), we were surprised by the poor performance of
the RLM that uses estimates of confidence to update learning rates (e.g., Vinckier et al., 2016).
This suggests that the adapting the learning rate is not sufficient to capture how participants
adapted to the change in reward contingencies. For example, an additional consideration could
be narrowing down the focus of attention to the relevant category to learn a new target (Leong
et al. 2017). In sharp contrast, our HMM provided a generally excellent fit to participants’
choices in the reversal task, even though the recovered parameters do not reflect the statistics of
the experiment. This demonstrates the potential for HMMs to shed light on mechanisms
underlying reward learning in unstable environments and suggest a computationally simple
mechanism by which the human brain infers the probability of hidden states. Our HMM uses
only three parameters to estimate beliefs that each of the images is the target on each trial. State
anxiety positively correlated with the parameter governing the transition matrix that
determines the diffusion of hidden states between images from trial-to-trial. In participants with
high state anxiety, the hidden states tend to diffuse more freely among the stimuli than in
participants with low state anxiety, suggesting that anxiety promotes imprecision in the
representation of the reward structure of the environment, implying an expectation that
previously established reward contingencies are likely to shift. In the reversal task, this belief
appears to increase the tendency to interpret the relatively ambiguous negative feedback as a
target reversal rather than due to chance. Supporting this notion, the transition parameter
mediated effects of state anxiety on probabilistic error proportions and reward learning,
suggesting that an overly volatile reward structure representation can be detrimental for
27 optimising behaviour to gain reward in unstable environments.
Our findings extend previous evidence for protective effects of perceived environmental
controllability, and maladaptive effects of experiencing lack of control. For example, a sense of
control in stressful environments attenuates later behavioural and neural responses to aversive
stimuli, possibly via vmPFC activation inhibiting pain, stress, and fear responses (Cremers et al.,
2021; Hartley et al., 2014; Kerr et al., 2012; Limbachia et al., 2021; Meine et al., 2021; Salomons
et al., 2004; Wade-Bohleber et al., 2021; Wanke & Schwabe, 2020; Wiech et al., 2006; Wood et al.,
34 (
2015). Conversely, perceived stress uncontrollability can enhance feelings of helplessness
Meine et al., 2021), increase stress responses, and promote passive behaviour in the face of
later stressors (Hiroto & Seligman, 1975; Moscarello & Hartley, 2017), possibly via decreased
vmPFC inhibition of stress-related neural structures (Maier & Seligman, 2016; Datta & Arnsten,
2019). In addition to its role in learning to avoid stressors, vmPFC is also implicated in learning
action values to gain rewards (Vassena et al., 2014), and in inferring hidden states (Niv, 2019).
Our findings suggest that, similarly to how uncontrollable stress impairs acting to avoid stress, it
also can impair acting to gain rewards in ambiguous contexts. Thus, perceived uncontrollable
stress may affect processes that encompass learning from both positive and aversive outcomes
43 to make optimal choices to avoid stress or gain rewards in uncertain contexts.
Anxiety has previously been linked to inaccurate and less certain estimates of environmental
volatility (e.g., Hein et al., 2021). Such misrepresentations of reward contingencies can lead to
impaired learning and decision-making. For example, trait anxiety, state anxiety, and acute
stress have all been linked to deficits in adjusting learning rates to match current environmental
volatility (Bishop & Gagne, 2018; Browning et al. 2015; Hein et al., 2021; Raio et al., 2017).
Moreover, failures to adaptively adjust learning rates in volatile contexts has been linked to a
more general trait negative affect factor that includes both anxiety and depressive symptoms,
and this deficit generalises across learning from rewarding and aversive outcomes (Gagne et al.,
2020). But there are mixed findings regarding the mechanisms underlying this altered flexibility.
For example, trait anxiety has been seemingly paradoxically linked to quicker behavioural
adjustments in response to punishments (Aylward et al., 2019) and to less sensitivity to negative
feedback (Xia et al., 2021). Our findings suggest that, under ambiguous conditions of second-
order uncertainty, state anxiety is specifically associated with greater anticipation of
environmental volatility, reflected by an overactive tendency to believe reward contingencies
will change (reflected by the parameter tr), thus increasing probabilistic errors and impairing
13 reward learning.
Our exploratory mediation analysis suggested that variability in state anxiety partially explained
the effect of uncontrollable stress on reward learning, but the mediation did not quite reach
significance. Although these results should be interpreted with caution, they raise the possibility
that the extent to which people feel anxious after experiencing perceived uncontrollable stress
may determine how reward learning is affected. Studies experimentally manipulating perceived
lack of control, using subsequent anxiety as a mediator, could shed light on whether this is a
plausible causal path to impaired reward learning. Moreover, longitudinal studies could
determine whether this hypothesised path results in anhedonic depressive symptoms in some
individuals. An alternative possibility is that perceived uncontrollable stress and state anxiety are
tapping into different aspects of the same latent construct that affects reward learning, for
24 example intolerance of second-order uncertainty, or fear of the unknown (Carleton, 2016).
One limitation is that within-subject test-retest reliability for task performance was low.
Cognitive tasks that produce robust and replicable experimental effects tend to have low
between-subject variability, which necessarily produces less reliable individual differences
(which benefit from high between-subject variability; see Hedge et al., 2018 for a detailed
explanation). Low test-retest reliability does not indicate that a task is not a replicable, valid, or a
robust measure of a construct, but it does make it more difficult to detect relationships between
task performance and individual differences (Hedge et al., 2018). Thus, although this issue is
mitigated by our relatively large sample of 427 participants, our effect sizes may be
underestimated. In future studies, using multiple tasks to obtain a more reliable composite index
that reflects performance of a common latent construct (e.g., reward learning) may be fruitful for
increasing sensitivity to detect relationships with individual differences (e.g., Moutoussis et al.,
2021). Another limitation is that our preregistered exploratory factor analysis did not produce
reliable factor scores, and so we instead used confirmatory factor models to obtain weighted
scores based on previously established scales and subscales. A promising avenue for future work
is using Computational Factor Modelling to identify and validate symptom dimensions against
40 computationally well-defined neurocognitive processes (Wise et al., 2022).
To conclude, our results show that perceived uncontrollable stress and state anxiety collectively
predicted worse reward learning in the reversal task involving ambiguous volatility. The
computational modelling suggests that state anxiety promotes a misrepresentation of the
reward structure of the environment, enhancing expectations of environmental volatility. As a
result, participants with higher state anxiety tend to interpret ambiguous negative feedback as a
change in reward contingencies, impairing exploitation of known reward regimes in uncertain
3 contexts.

As preregistered, 500 participants were recruited via the online platform Prolific
Participants were paid a base of £3.00 GPB for an estimated 25 minutes of their time and could
earn a bonus of up to £2.30 GBP based on task performance. Participants earned on average £4.39,
for an average session duration of 28.5 minutes. Eleven participants’ data could not be recovered
from Pavlovia. Nine participants were excluded based on the preregistered criterion (mean
response time/RT <300 ms). In error, the reversal task was first launched with the possibility of
the target consecutively repeating (i.e., some target reversals occurred after 40-60 trials, instead
of 20-30 trials); so these 53 participants were excluded from analyses. This left a total of 427
participants (189 identified as female, 237 as male, and one as non-binary) from 47 different
countries, with a mean age of 30 years (range 18-74). The sample size should provide sufficient
statistical power for an EFA on the 69 item scores (e.g., Zygmont & Smith, 2014). Fifty (49 after
one exclusion for <300 ms mean RT) of the same participants completed an identical session
approximately three days later, to assess within-subject test-retest reliability of their factor scores

Participants were given information about the task and questionnaires before giving informed
consent by pressing a button. They read task instructions and completed three practice games of
the signalled task. All participants completed the signalled task first followed by the reversal
task. Both tasks were versions of a three-armed bandit probabilistic reward learning task
adapted from Leong et al. (2017). The code and stimuli to run the task can be found at
1 The signalled task
comprised six games of 25 trials each. Each trial began with a 500 ms central
fixation cross. Then, nine images were presented in a 3x3 grid for 2000 ms or until a response was
made. Each image category was arranged horizontally, with animals across the bottom, modes of
transport across the middle, and landscapes across the top. This arrangement created three
vertical composite stimuli, each comprising one animal, one mode of transport, and one landscape.
Participants chose one of the three composite stimuli on each trial using the left, down (for the
middle), and right arrow keys. Participants were correctly told that the target (e.g., a forest)
randomly changed at the start of each game. If the chosen composite stimulus included the target,
the probability of gaining reward (a point, representing 1 GBP penny) was 75%. If the chosen
stimulus did not include the target, reward probability was 25%. The goal was to maximise
reward by learning the identity of the target based on reward feedback (presented for 1000 ms
immediately following a response, along with the chosen stimulus). Rewards were indicated by a
yellow star that appeared below the centre image location. On no-reward trials, a red cross
appeared instead. If no response was made within 2000 ms, an image of a clock reminded them
to respond faster. After each game, they were told which image was the target, their points earned

was like the signalled task except for the following alterations. Instead of a series
of games, participants completed all 150 trials continuously with no breaks. The target changed
without warning 5 times in total. A target reversal occurred between every 20-30 trials.
Specifically, from trial 20 after the previous reversal, on each trial there was a 10% chance of the
next reversal, and a reversal always occurred at the latest after 30 trials. Because these target
reversals made the task more difficult, to make the task more manageable we increased reward
probability to 80% upon choosing the target (20% otherwise). Because the target reversals
occurred at different trial numbers across participants, and there was a fixed number of trials in
total to match the signalled task, some participants had only a small number of trials after the final
target reversal, which were insufficient to examine learning. We therefore discarded trials after
28 the fifth reversal for all participants for both tasks for consistency.
After the task, participants were given their reversal task points total, overall points tally, and total

Participants completed 69 items across four questionnaires, assessing their state, traits, and mood
over the previous two weeks. All questionnaires except the new Perceived Risk of COVID-19 scale
(Wise et al., 2020), are well-validated and established measures of their respective constructs. The
COVID-19 scale included 10 items assessing perceived potential impact of COVID-19 on oneself
and others (Wise et al., 2020). The PHQ-9 included 9 items assessing depressive symptoms rated
on a 4-point Likert scale from “never” to “almost every day” (Kroenke et al., 2001). The PSS (Cohen
et al., 1983; 1994) included 10 items assessing perceived ability to cope with stress rated on a 5-
point Likert scale from “never” to “very often”. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STA1I9;
Spielberger, 1980; 2010) included 40 items rated on a 4-point Likert scale from “not at all” to “very
much so” assessing how they felt right at that moment, and how they feel generally. Positively
worded items (e.g., “I feel comfortable”) were reverse-coded so that higher scores indicated
5 z
greater stress, state and trait anxiety, depression, and perceived risk of COVID-19. We then
6 centred ( scored) each item to be on the same scale.
Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was performed using the “fa” function in the “psych” R package
8 KMO
(Revelle, 2022) to find latent factors present within and across these questionnaires. The Kaiser,
Meyer, Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was close to 1 ( = 0.96) suggesting that
the sum of partial correlations was not large relative to the sum of correlations, meaning that the
11 df p
data should result in distinct and reliable factors (Kaiser, 1970). Moreover, Bartlett’s test (Bartlett,
1951) was significant (χ2 = 18801, = 2346, < .001), indicating that the residual correlations
13 mvw p
were all zero, also suggesting that the data was appropriate for EFA. Because the data were not
normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk = 0.98, < .001) we used the ordinary least squares
method to find the minimum residual solution ("minres" method) which provides results similar
to the maximum likelihood method, without assuming multivariate normal distribution (Schmitt,
17 2011). We used oblique ("oblimin") rotation because we expected our factors to be correlated.
There are many possible ways to determine the appropriate number of factors in an EFA (see
Costello & Osborne, 2005; Schmitt, 2011). As we did not preregister this detail, we tested different
approaches. We first ran an EFA with eight-factors, then seven, then six, and lastly five-factors. All
four solutions provided a similarly good fit to the data (e.g., Finch, 2020) with root mean square
error of approximation (RSMEA) of 0.057 (five- and six-factors); 0.058 (seven-factors) and 0.061
(eight-factors). The clearest, meaningful, yet parsimonious structure was a seven-factor model,
which was consistent with the parallel analysis (Horn, 1965) which compares the scree of factors
of the observed data with a random data matrix of the same size to estimate the appropriate
number of factors (Schmitt, 2011). Factor scores were obtained using the Thurstone regression
27 method (DiStefano et al., 2009; Thurstone, 1935).
As the factor scores from the EFA were not test-retest reliable within the 49 individuals who
calculated congeneric factor scores, using confirmatory latent factor models to produce weighted
scores based on the structure of previously established and validated subscales (see McNeish &
Wolf, 2020). In a congeneric model, each item contributes to the score with a weight that is
dependent on how related the item is to the construct. If one item is more closely related to the
construct than a second item, the first item score contributes more weight to the factor score. Each
item is allowed to have unique error variance (i.e., the latent construct accounts for a different
amount of variance in each item), and the latent construct is given scale by constraining the
fit to the data than parallel models (which are equivalent to sum scores, with each item
contributing to the score with equal weight), indicating that the weighted congeneric scores were
40 preferred over sum scores to be used as fixed-factors in subsequent analyses.
To determine whether each scale (e.g., Perceived Stress Scale) should be subset into previously
established subscales (e.g., Uncontrollable Stress and Lack of Self-efficacy), we fitted the data for
each scale to one-factor (all items), and two-factor (items from each subscale) congeneric models
using the lavaan package in R (Rosseel, 2012). Model comparison was done using the “nonnest2”
package in R (Vuong, 1989). For the Perceived Stress Scale, a two-factor model was a better fit to
our data than a one-factor model, in line with previous findings (Andreou et al., 2011; Golde2n0-
Kreutz et al., 2004; Khalili et al., 2017; Nielsen et al., 2016; Roberti, et al., 2006). Uncontrollable
Stress (also referred to as Perceived Helplessness in the previous literature) includes six
negatively-framed items regarding the impact of perceived uncontrollable stress (e.g., “In the last
month, how often have you been angered because of things that were outside of your control?”).
Lack of Self-efficacy includes four positively-framed items regarding perceived ability to cope with
7 r p
stressors (e.g., “In the last month, how often have you been able to control irritations in your life?”.

of COVID-19 Risk) was a better fit than a one-factor model. The two COVID-19 factors significantly
correlated with one another, (425) = 0.506, < .001. Although the PHQ-9 is often considered to
be a one-factor construct, a two-factor structure with a cognitive and affective factor, and a
13 r p
somatic factor can also be a good fit (e.g., Boothroyd et al., 2019), and was a better fit to our data
than a one-factor model. But because the two factors were so highly correlated, (425) = 0.772,
15 < .001, for the sake of parsimony, we treated Depression as one factor.
The State and Trait Anxiety Inventory scales can be further divided into negatively-framed items
indexing the presence of anxiety symptoms (e.g., “I feel upset”), and positively-framed items
indexing the absence of anxiety symptoms (e.g., “I feel calm”) which were reverse-coded so higher
scores indicate, for example, less calm. Consistent with previous work (Spielberger, 1980; Vigneau
& Cormier, 2008), a four-factor model with State Anxiety (negatively-framed items), State Anxiety
(positively-framed items), Trait Anxiety (negatively-framed items), and Trait Anxiety (positively-
22 r
framed items) was a better fit than a two-factor Trait and State Anxiety model. The State Anxiety
23 p r
negatively-framed and positively-framed factors significantly correlated with one another, (425)

= 0.645, < .001; as did the Trait Anxiety negatively-framed and positively-framed factors, (425)

Test-retest reliability for factor scores, mean task performance, and the estimated parameters
from the winning HMM were indexed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) using two-way
29 Impact of uncontrollable stress and state anxiety on reward learning
random-effects models (McGraw & Wong, 1996; Shrout & Fleiss, 1979).
To examine the effect of each Factor on learning we performed generalised logistic mixed-models
(GLMMs, using the lmer R package; Bates et al., 2015) with accuracy (0, 1) as the dependent
variable, Trial (centred around 0) as a fixed-effect, and by-subject random intercepts and slopes
34 linear logistic
for Trial thus allowing for between-subject variability in learning. Although the preregistration
stated mixed-models, a mixed-model is appropriate because accuracy (0, 1) is a
binary variable. Furthermore, the preregistration stated that we would include game as a fixed-
effect, however because we did not expect performance to linearly increase in the reversal task, it
was unclear how to meaningfully code game as a factor. For the sake of parsimony and
39 interpretability, we decided to deviate from the preregistration and not include game as a factor.
Each Factor was included as an interaction with Trial in separate models. If a significant Trial x
Factor interaction was present, we compared the fit of that model to a model without that
interaction (i.e., with only Trial as a fixed-effect), using a chi-squared ANOVA test. If including the
Trial x Factor interaction significantly improved model fit, we then added the Trial x Factor
interaction term as by-subject random intercept and slope (i.e., allowing for the intercepts and
slopes for the effect of the factor on learning to differ across participants), and compared the fit 2o1f
that more complex model to the previous model without the random-effect interaction. Factors
that showed significant interactions with Trial were then entered together into one final
combined model. We checked for potential issues of multicollinearity between factor scores in
subsequent models by calculating Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs using the “car” package in R,
6 OFothx e&r Wpreeisrbeegrigs,t e2r0e1d9 )l.e a rning and error dependent variables.
In the preregistration we predicted that Uncontrollable Stress would be associated with fewer
win-stay trials in the reversal task. We also expected perceived uncontrollable stress to result
greater sensitivity to negative feedback, which would be observed in fewer perseveration errors.
Win-stay trials are choosing the target directly after being rewarded for choosing the target.
Perseverative errors index the tendency to stick with choosing the previously learned target after
a target reversal has occurred, despite receiving negative feedback for choosing the previous
target. These dependent variables are typically used in two-armed bandit tasks with non-
composite stimuli, when it is clear what stimulus participants are basing their value estimation
and choice on. However, in our three-armed bandit task, a choice could be based on a prediction
that any one of the three images comprising the chosen stimulus were the target. Because the
images shuffle on each trial, it therefore makes less sense to examine these dependent variables
19 with our task, and we did not analyse these DVs.
Probabilistic errors index anticipation of a target reversal, specifically when choice shifts away
from the current target immediately following probabilistic negative feedback for a correct
response, after learning has occurred (defined in the preregistration as five correct trials in a row).
We predicted that Uncontrollable Stress would predict more probabilistic errors, indicating pre-

We used the mediation package in R (Tingley et al., 2014) to perform exploratory causal mediation
analyses (Imai et al., 2010). We calculated 95% confidence intervals using 10,000 bootstrapped
28 sCaommppleust.a tional modelling
We fitted a range of models from two main families to the observed choices in the reversal task.
As indicated in the preregistration, we fitted a range of reinforcement learning models (RLMs) to
examine the cognitive mechanisms by which perceived uncontrollable stress or other latent
factors might impact learning in the signalled or reversal tasks. Because the RLMs did a poor job
at explaining the observed choices in the reversal task, we deviated from the preregistration and
fitted two hidden Markov models (HMMs). Choices in the signalled task were not analysed with
computational modelling because we did not observe any significant effects for any of the nine
37 Reinforcement Learning Models (RLMs)
factor scores on performance.
Our RLMs assume that participants learn to associate each image with a value (feature learning),
based on reward feedback, and linearly combine these values to determine the value of each
choice on a given trial (e.g., Leong et al., 2017):
𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖 𝑑𝑑 𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖
𝑉𝑉 (𝑆𝑆 ) = ∑ 𝑣𝑣 (𝑑𝑑, 𝑆𝑆 ) (1)
1 i t d
𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖 𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖
where 𝑉𝑉 (𝑆𝑆 ) is the value of a composite stimulus on trial , and 𝑣𝑣 (𝑑𝑑, 𝑆𝑆 ) is the value of image
𝑖𝑖
on stimulus 𝑆𝑆 . For the signalled task, all 𝑣𝑣 were initialised to 0 at the beginning of each game. For
the reversal task, all 𝑣𝑣 were initialised to 0 at the beginning of the first game. On each trial, the
𝑡𝑡
prediction error is calculated as the difference between the reward obtained 𝑟𝑟 ∈ {0,1} and the
6 𝑐𝑐 𝑡𝑡 𝑐𝑐
value of the chosen composite stimulus, 𝑆𝑆 , on that trial 𝑉𝑉 (𝑆𝑆 ):
𝑡𝑡 𝑡𝑡 𝑡𝑡 𝑐𝑐
7 𝛿𝛿 = 𝑟𝑟 − 𝑉𝑉 (𝑆𝑆 ) (2)
We used this prediction error to update the value of the images included in the chosen
composite stimulus:
10 𝑡𝑡+1 𝑐𝑐 𝑡𝑡 𝑐𝑐 𝑡𝑡
𝑣𝑣 (𝑑𝑑, 𝑆𝑆 ) = 𝑣𝑣 (𝑑𝑑, 𝑆𝑆 ) + 𝛼𝛼𝛿𝛿 (3)
where 𝛼𝛼 (0 < 𝛼𝛼 < 1 ) is the learning rate determining how much the future values reflect the
latest experienced outcome.
Finally, we calculated the choice probability using the softmax rule:
𝛽𝛽𝑉𝑉 (𝑆𝑆 )
𝑡𝑡 𝑐𝑐
𝑒𝑒
𝛽𝛽𝑉𝑉 (𝑆𝑆 )
𝑡𝑡 𝑎𝑎
𝑝𝑝(𝑐𝑐) = ∑𝑎𝑎 𝑒𝑒 (4)
14 c a
whereby 𝑝𝑝(𝑐𝑐) is the probability of choosing the composite stimulus , enumerates over all
available composite stimuli, and 𝛽𝛽 (𝛽𝛽 > 0) is the inverse temperature parameter of the softmax
rule determining how much choices are determined by the differences in values among stimuli.
The simplest RLM has two free parameters – learning rate (𝛼𝛼), and softmax inverse temperature
(𝛽𝛽, which captures reward sensitivity at one end of the spectrum, and stochasticity in responding
at the other). To improve the performance of the RLM, we deviated from the preregistration and
augmented the base model with a forget parameter 𝜑𝜑 (0 < 𝜑𝜑 < 1) by which the value of the
unselected images relaxed towards 0, the initial value (e.g., de Boer et al., 2017):
23 𝑡𝑡+1 𝑎𝑎 𝑡𝑡 𝑎𝑎 𝑡𝑡 𝑎𝑎 𝑎𝑎≠𝑐𝑐
𝑣𝑣 (𝑑𝑑, 𝑆𝑆 ) = 𝑣𝑣 (𝑑𝑑, 𝑆𝑆 ) + 𝜑𝜑(0 − 𝑣𝑣 (𝑑𝑑, 𝑆𝑆 )) 𝜒𝜒 (5)
where the last term restricts forgetting to the non-chosen images. As indicated in the
𝑝𝑝
preregistration, this model was augmented to include two separate learning rates: 𝛼𝛼 for positive
𝑛𝑛
( 𝛿𝛿 > 0), and 𝛼𝛼 for negative reward prediction errors (𝛿𝛿 ≤0). Finally, the model with forget rate
and two separate learning rates was augmented to include a meta-learning level (Vinckier et al.,
𝑡𝑡
2016). The meta-learning model computes a trial-by-trial measure of confidence 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 in choice
based on the absolute value of the prediction error on a given trial so that when prediction errors
are smaller, confidence is higher:
31 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑡𝑡+1 = 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑡𝑡 + 𝛾𝛾((2 − |𝛿𝛿 𝑡𝑡 |)/2 − 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 𝑡𝑡 ) (6)
where 𝛾𝛾 is the confidence learning rate, and is a free parameter. Confidence then modulates the
learning rate on a trial-by-trial basis:
𝑡𝑡 𝑝𝑝 𝑡𝑡 𝑡𝑡
34 𝛼𝛼 = (𝛼𝛼 + 𝜅𝜅𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 )/(1 + 𝜅𝜅𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 ) if 𝛿𝛿 > 0
35 𝑡𝑡 𝑛𝑛 𝑡𝑡
𝛼𝛼 = 𝛼𝛼 /(1 + 𝜅𝜅𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 ) otherwise (7)
where 𝜅𝜅 is a free parameter determining the extent to which confidence modulates learning rate
differently depending on whether the outcome received on that trial was better or worse than
expected: the learning rate increases proportional to the confidence for better than expected
outcomes and decreases proportionally to the confidence in worse than expected outcomes. In
the preregistration, we planned to include a model with confidence modulating the softmax
inverse temperature parameter. However, given the poor performance of the RLM in our task, we
did not continue exploring the model space of RLMs.
4 Our preregistered predictions from the RLMs were:
1) For the signalled task we predicted that Uncontrollable Stress would decrease the learning rate
6 β
for positive reward prediction errors (better than expected outcomes); while not affecting reward
𝑛𝑛
sensitivity ( ); nor affecting learning rate for negative prediction errors (𝛼𝛼 , worse than expected
outcomes). Alternatively, we predicted that Uncontrollable Stress may even increase the learning
9 rate for negative prediction errors.
2) For the reversal task, in our RLMs we expected Uncontrollable Stress to increase sensitivity to
𝑛𝑛
negative feedback, reflected by an increased learning rate for negative prediction errors (𝛼𝛼 ). In
12 β
line with the signalled task, we predicted that Uncontrollable Stress would decrease the learning
𝑝𝑝
13 rate for positive prediction errors (𝛼𝛼 ): while not affecting reward sensitivity ( ).
3) Moreover, we expected that Uncontrollable Stress would influence a second hierarchical level
15 β
to our RLM: confidence (𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶) in current task representations. Higher confidence was expected
to modulate the free parameters of the RLM by increasing exploitation (reward sensitivity, );
increasing learning rate for outcomes that confirm expectations and reducing learning rate to
outcomes that contradict expectations. We predicted that Uncontrollable Stress may reduce the
rate of learning of confidence itself, and/or the extent to which confidence modulated these free
20 β
𝑝𝑝
parameters (learning rate for positive prediction errors (𝛼𝛼 ), learning rate for negative prediction
𝑛𝑛
21 errors (𝛼𝛼 ), and reward sensitivity, ).
These predictions were not explored because performance in the signalled task was not
23 Hmioddduelna tMeda rbkyo Uvn Mcoondterlosl l(aHbMleM Stsr)e ss and the reversal task was poorly fitted by the RLM models.
HMMs differ from RLMs as they do not use feature learning to determine a cached value of each
image. Instead, inference based on an HMM estimates the probability that each of the individual
images is the target on a given trial. The identity of the target image is referred to as the hidden
state because it cannot be observed directly but only indirectly through the rewards obtained
𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖
after each choice. On each trial, the model updates the probability 𝛼𝛼 (𝐶𝐶 ) of each hidden state (i.e.,
30 𝑖𝑖
each image 𝐶𝐶 being the target) upon observing the outcome as follows:
31 𝑡𝑡+1 𝑖𝑖 𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖
𝛼𝛼 (𝐶𝐶 ) ∝ 𝛼𝛼 (𝐶𝐶 ) ∗ 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 (8)
𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖
where 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 is the likelihood that image 𝐶𝐶 is the target and is calculated differently depending on
whether the image was part of the chosen composite stimulus or not. For the chosen features:
34 𝑖𝑖 𝑡𝑡
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 = 𝑞𝑞 if 𝑟𝑟 = 1
35 𝑖𝑖
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 = 1 − 𝑞𝑞 otherwise (9)
where 0 < 𝑞𝑞 < 1 is a free parameter representing the model's expected probability that a reward
is observed when the chosen stimulus involves the target. For the unchosen features:
38 𝑖𝑖 𝑡𝑡
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 = 𝑝𝑝 if 𝑟𝑟 = 1
𝑖𝑖
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 = 1 − 𝑝𝑝 otherwise (10)
where 0 < 𝑝𝑝 < 1 is a free parameter representing the model's expected probability that a reward
outcome is observed when the chosen stimulus does not involve the target.
After updating, the hidden states are renormalized, and the vector of hidden states is multiplied
by the transition matrix mapping the expected probability that the hidden state on the next trial
will transit from each image to any other image. All values of the 9 x 9 matrix except for the
diagonal are specified as 𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟/8, 0 < 𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟 < 1 being a free parameter representing the model's
expected probability that the hidden state will change to any other feature from one trial to the
next trial. The diagonal of the transition matrix is specified as 1 − 𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟. The diagonal thus represents
the model's expected probability that the hidden state will not change from one trial to the next.
Finally, we calculated the likelihood of the choices based directly on the hidden states assuming
probability matching (Herrnstein, 1997; Myers, 2014; Vulkan, 2000):
∑𝑐𝑐 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡(𝑓𝑓𝑐𝑐)
𝑝𝑝(𝑐𝑐) = ∑𝑖𝑖=1 𝛼𝛼𝑡𝑡(𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖) (11)
14 c
whereby 𝑝𝑝(𝑐𝑐) is the probability of choosing a composite stimulus including three chosen features
15 tr
originally augmented to include another free parameter 𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟 (0 < 𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟 < 5) that multiplies
𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖
all hidden states 𝛼𝛼 (𝐶𝐶 ) before the likelihood of the choices was calculated. Thus, this parameter
magnifies the differences in the hidden states and is akin to the inverse temperature of the softmax
rule for RLMs and allows for under- and over-matching. However, recoverability checks (see
22 Model estimation and model comparison
model was not considered further.
Model parameters for both RLM and HMM were fitted and compared using the HBI toolbox (Piray
et al., 2019) that works on MATLAB (2020b). The HBI toolbox simultaneously achieves parameter
estimation and random effect's model comparison using a variational approach (Piray et al.,
2019). The HBI toolbox implements a hierarchical Bayesian approach that estimates the
population distribution over the model parameters as well as the parameters of each individual
subject given the population distribution, which constrains and regularizes individual subject's
parameters estimates (Piray et al., 2019). The toolbox allows the best fitting model to vary across
individual subjects and model comparison is done by counting the frequency of individual
subjects that are best fit by each model and deriving the exceedance probability for each model
(Piray et al., 2019). Moreover, by achieving concurrent parameters estimation and model
comparison, the contribution of each subject to the group level estimates of the parameters are
weighted by the degree to which a given model is likely to be the underlying model for that subject
Our preregistration specified we would use RStan, however HBI allowed easier implementation
of the HMMs, so we used HBI for all models. Both methods are hierarchical Bayesian approaches
but whereas the HBI uses a variational Bayes approach to estimate the posterior probabilities of
the parameter, the RStan uses Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling to obtain the full
distribution. Similarly, we deviated from the preregistration by not testing models in which
individual-level parameters drawn from the group-level normal distributions were allowed to
vary according to the subject score on perceived control (as suggested in Moutoussis et al., 2018).
Instead, we performed correlations between the estimated parameters and the factor scores
3 Rouetcsoivdeer oafb tihliet ym aondaellys.s is
To ascertain that we were able to recover the different models that we tested, we simulated five
data sets for the reversal task. For these simulations, we used one of the following generative
models: 1) base RLM model, 2) base RLM model with forget parameters, 3) base RLM model with
forget parameter and confidence modulation of learning rate, 4) base HMM, and 5) base HMM
with power parameter. For each generative model, we sampled 1000 combinations of the
parameters using the mean and variance estimated at the group level for that model. As HBI
weights the contribution of each subject to the group-level estimates of the parameters by the
degree to which a given model is likely to be the underlying model for that subject, we did not
have reliable parameter estimates for models that were very unlikely. To obtain parameters for
14 those models, we estimated them by themselves, not being compared to any other model.
For each simulated data set, we then fitted all five models and performed model comparison using
correlations of the generative parameters against the recovered parameters (see Figures S.1 and
S.2 for HMM3 and HMM4). We also checked the correlation between the generative parameters

models to obtain the factor scores (using the Vuong test in the “nonnest2” package in R). We used
previously established scales (one-factor models) and subscales (two and four-factor models; see
McNeish & Wolf, 2020) to determine contributing items. Parallel models create linear
transformations of the sum scores. Congeneric models produce weighted scores based on how related
each item is to the construct. LRT is the likelihood ratio test statistic (values below 0 indicate the
second model is a better fit; values above 0 indicate the first model is a better fit) and the values
test the significance of the LRT. BIC is Bayesian Information Criterion. CI lower and CI upper indicate
95% confidence intervals surrounding the difference between BICs for each model comparison.

toolbox (Piray et al., 2019). RLM refers to Reinforcement Learning Models; HMM refers to the hidden
Markov model with three parameters. Model frequency indicates the ratio of participants assigned
to each model. Exceedance probability is the likelihood that each model is the most likely model,
considering the possibility that differences in model evidence are due to chance.

hidden Markov model with three parameters, for the reversal task. The parameter represents an
estimate of the expected probability that a non-reward outcome is observed when the chosen
stimulus does not involve the target (the actual value being 0.8); represents an estimate of the
expected probability that a reward outcome is observed when the chosen stimulus does include the
target (the actual value being 0.8); and the parameter represents the expectation that the identity
of the target will shift to another image on the next trial.
