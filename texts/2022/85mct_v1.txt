Abstract
Executive functioning, language, and attention processes are commonly affected in acute stroke
patients and predict long-term cognitive, emotional and functional impairment. Comprehensive
assessment of these predictors is therefore vital for management, interventions and recovery. Brief
cognitive screens are more appropriate than large batteries for acute stroke patients; however, they
currently lack adequate measurement of language and executive functioning. In this study we
investigated the validity, sensitivity, and specificity of the novel Brief Executive Language Screening
Test (BELS); a ~20-minute test developed to assess core language, propositional language, and
implicated executive functions (initiation, inhibition, selection, and strategy use). Method. The final
sample included 78 acute stroke patients and 71 healthy controls. Convergent and divergent validity
of BELS subtests was investigated via correlations with established neuropsychology tests. Predictive
validity was investigated using logistic regression, and a ROC curve was employed to determine
sensitivity and specificity. Results. Convergent validity was established for all but two BELS subtests
via moderate-to-strong correlations with comparative neuropsychology tests. Divergent validity was
established for all subtests via non-significant correlations with a dissimilar neuropsychology test.
Low BELS scores significantly predicted stroke status after controlling for age, education, premorbid
and fluid intelligence. The ROC Curve analysis indicated excellent discrimination (AUC = .94, p <.001,
95%CI [.91 - .98]). A cut-off of 84.25/100 was highly sensitive (.91) and specific (.80) when
distinguishing acute stroke patients from healthy controls. Conclusion. The BELS is a valid bedside
screening tool, sensitive to language and executive impairments experienced by acute stroke
patients.
Public Significance Statement: Acute stroke patients frequently demonstrate language and
executive function impairments, which predict long-term outcomes. This study established that the
novel Brief Executive Language Screen is a valid, sensitive and specific screen of these domains in
acute stroke.
Post-stroke cognitive impairments occur in up to 70% of patients and frequently persist
long-term (> 1 year), which contributes to disability and reduced quality of life (Barker-Collo & Feign,
2006; Hackett & Anderson, 2000; Nys et al., 2007; Wagle et al., 2011; Warlow, 1998). Domains
commonly affected during the acute stage (within three weeks of stroke) include executive functions
language, attention, and memory (Chahal et al., 2011; Nys et al., 2007; Law et al., 2015; Robinson et
al., 2021). Acute executive, language and attention deficits are predictors of long-term functional,
neuropsychological, and emotional outcomes (Chahal et al., 2011; Nys et al., 2005; Nys et al., 2007;
Lesniak et al., 2008; Robertson et al., 1997). Comprehensive assessment of these predictors is
therefore crucial; however, large neuropsychological test batteries are unrealistic due to fatigue and
confusion experienced by acute stroke patients. Brief cognitive screening tests that can be
administered at bedside are more practical; however, they currently lack adequate measurement of
executive functions and language. In this study, we investigate the validity, sensitivity, and specificity
of the novel Brief Executive Language Screening Test (BELS) in an acute stroke sample.
Acute impairments in executive functions (e.g., initiation, inhibition, planning, problem
solving) occur in 40% of patients, and impacts successful daily living and mental health (Chahal et al.,
2011; Pohjasvaara et al., 2002). It is also the strongest predictor of functional and cognitive
outcomes one-year post-stroke (Lesniak et al., 2008; Nys et al., 2005; Nys et al., 2007). Stroke
patients also often demonstrate impaired propositional language; which is voluntary, spontaneous,
and connected speech that is novel to a context, and crucial for communicating ideas, thoughts,
instructions, and feelings (Barker et al., 2020; Law et al., 2015; Levelt, 1999; Robinson et al., 2021;
Sherratt, 2007). Impairment presents as diminished quantity and quality of connected speech, and
consequently individuals can experience less meaningful communication and strained relationships
with others (Law et al., 2015). Importantly, non-aphasic stroke patients have shown propositional
language impairment, highlighting the subtlety of these deficits that are easily missed without
sufficient assessment (Law et al., 2015).
Propositional language impairment highlights the interface of language and executive
functions (Alexander, 2006; Barker et al., 2017; Barker et al., 2022; Robinson et al., 2006; Robinson
et al., 2015; Robinson et al., 2021). Models of spoken language production (e.g., Dell, 1986; Dell et
al., 1999; Levelt, 1989; Levelt, 1999; Sherratt, 2007) typically posit three stages: conceptualisation
(i.e., broader formulation and structure of intended message, resulting in a ‘pre-verbal’ message);
linguistic formulation (i.e., words encoded with syntax and sounds retrieved and available to
speaker); and articulation (i.e., overt speech). Executive functions are integral to the
conceptualisation stage, and include planning, idea generation, selection (i.e., choosing from
competing ideas, inhibiting irrelevant ideas), and sequencing in a coherent and cohesive manner
(Alexander, 2006; Barker et al., 2017; Barker et al., 2022; Robinson et al., 1998; Robinson et al.,
2006; Robinson et al., 2015). Additional executive functions reflected in conceptualisation of a
message are energization (initiating and maintaining verbal responses), task-setting (ensuring
responses are task-appropriate/relevant), and monitoring for errors and necessary adjustments in
speech (Stuss & Alexander, 2007). Evidence from the language disorder of dynamic aphasia
demonstrates disruption to conceptualisation processes (i.e., impaired propositional language) while
core or nominal language processes (i.e., naming, repetition, comprehension) remain intact
(Robinson et al., 1998; Robinson et al., 2005).
Damage to the executive function-language interface can present largely in right hemisphere
stroke (RHS) patients in the form of Cognitive-Communication Disorder (CCD; Heweston et al., 2017).
CCD involves difficulty linking context and language due to impaired executive functions, attention,
memory, perception, and slowed information processing (Heweston et al., 2017). Further, poor
cohesion and coherence of spontaneous speech in RHS patients is linked to executive and
attentional dysfunction, as opposed to linguistic deficits (Barker et al., 2017; Blake, 2021; Sherratt &
Bryan, 2012). However, impairments to propositional language have also been associated with left
frontal lobe damage (Costello & Warrington, 1989; Kiran, 2012; Price et al., 2010; Robinson et al.,
1998; Robinson et al., 2005; Robinson et al., 2021) or left basal ganglia damage (e.g., Crescentini et
al., 2008). Acute left hemisphere stroke (LHS) patients have shown greater impairment in executive
functions, memory, core language, and abstract reasoning than RHS patients (Nys et al., 2007).
Together, evidence suggests both hemispheres are implicated in post-stroke language impairments
due to the requirement of intact executive functions (Barker et al., 2017; Blake, 2021; Bloom, 1994;
Heweston et al., 2017; Mackenzie & Brady, 2008; Nys et al., 2007; Robinson et al., 1998; Robinson et
al., 2005; Robinson et al., 2021; Sherratt & Bryan, 2012).
Assessment can hinder our understanding of acute post-stroke executive and language
impairments and their long-term predictive power. Gold standard neuropsychology test batteries
can take several hours to administer and are therefore impractical in acute stroke patients who
fatigue quickly. Brief cognitive screens (5-10 minutes) are consequently administered (e.g., MMSE,
Folstein et al., 1975; MoCA; Nasreddine et al., 2005); however, these have been shown to lack
sensitivity and specificity, and consequently they underestimate cognitive impairment due to
absence or limited measurement of complex, multifaceted domains like language and executive
functioning (Blackburn et al., 2013; Blake et al., 2002; Chan et al., 2014; Chan et al., 2017; Chiti &
Pantoni, 2014; Demeyere et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2010; Mancuso et al., 2018; Nys et al., 2005b;
Salvadori et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2016). For instance, the MMSE has no measure of executive
functioning, and the MoCA assesses language via naming three objects and one sentence repetition
item (Folstein et al., 1975; Nasreddine et al., 2005). Therefore, a cognitive test appropriate for acute
stroke patients, that comprehensively assesses common, prognostic post-stroke impairments is
required. In this study we aim to fill this gap.
Validating the Brief Executive Language Screening Test (BELS)
The BELS is a novel cognitive assessment tool designed to test core nominal language skills,
in addition to propositional language and the integral executive functions of initiation, inhibition,
selection, and strategy use (Robinson et al., 2021). It additionally measures oral apraxia and
incidental verbal memory, and coherence and cohesion of connected speech can be calculated. The
test can be administered at bedside within 20 minutes, making it suitable for an acute stroke setting.
The BELS was developed to assess the three main stages of spoken language production (Dell, 1986;
Dell et al., 1999; Levelt, 1989; Levelt, 1999; Sherratt, 2007), and it has demonstrated construct
validity via confirmatory factor analysis: propositional language subtests loaded on
Conceptualisation; nominal language subtests loaded on Linguistic Formulation; and Oral Apraxia
loaded on Articulation (Robinson et al., 2021). Discriminant and predictive validity have also been
established (Robinson et al., 2021). After a slight adjustment to the BELS (one propositional language
subtest was added and another removed), the BELS requires further validation.
Aims of the Current Study
In this study we aimed to determine the convergent and divergent validity of the BELS, to
ensure cognitive processes captured in more extensive neuropsychological batteries were being
accurately measured by BELS subtests. That is, we investigated the relationships between BELS
subtests and established neuropsychology tests that measure the same/similar (convergent) and
different/dissimilar (divergent) cognitive process. We first hypothesised that BELS subtests will be
significantly correlated with established, theoretically linked neuropsychology tests (i.e.,
demonstrate convergent validity). Second, we hypothesised that BELS subtests will be non-
significantly correlated with theoretically dissimilar neuropsychology tests (i.e., demonstrate
divergent validity).
We also aimed to determine if a total score on the BELS could predict healthy or acute
stroke status (i.e., predictive validity). Our third hypothesis is that lower BELS scores will significantly
predict acute stroke status via a logistic regression (i.e., demonstrate predictive validity).
Finally, we investigated the sensitivity and specificity of a total BELS score when
distinguishing acute stroke patients from healthy controls. Our fourth hypothesis is that a ROC curve
will provide a cut-off score on the BELS that is sensitive (high true positive rate) and specific (low
false positive rate) when classifying acute stroke and healthy cases.
Method
Data used in this study was obtained by supervised clinical neuropsychology registrars and
doctoral candidates in hospital stroke wards as part of a larger longitudinal project between 2016
and 2022.
Participants
Ninety-seven first-time stroke patients aged over 18 with available brain imaging were
recruited. Seventeen patients were omitted based on exclusion criteria (previous stroke, presenting
with Transient Ischaemic Attack, non-English speakers, or diagnosis of another neurological
disorder). Three patients (SP039, SP061, SP095) were missing more than 50% of relevant data and
were therefore removed prior to analyses. This resulted in a final sample of 78 acute stroke patients
who were tested on average 17.41 days post-stroke (37.2% female; M Age = 63.31; M Education =
12.01 years; 62.8% right hemisphere, 34.6% left hemisphere, 2.6% bilateral; 92.3% ischemic stroke;
7.7% haemorrhagic). Seventy-nine healthy controls were recruited through the University of
Queensland (UQ) networks. One participant (CP056) was removed due to missing more than 50%
relevant data, and seven (CP003, CP014, CP015, CP029, CP031, CP041, CP045) were removed for
performing significantly below published normative data on neuropsychology tests. Therefore, the
final control group consisted of 71 adults (43.7% female; M Age = 64.37; M Education = 14.73 years).
Materials and Measures
BELS
Brief Description of Subtests. See Supplementary Materials for the BELS score sheet,
execution of five facial movements (e.g., whistling). Ten items (e.g., tiara) are used for Object
Naming, Word Repetition and Word Comprehension subtests. Action Naming includes five
illustrated actions obtained from Druks and Masterson’s (2000) Object and Action Naming Battery
(e.g., ‘shooting’), which are subsequently transformed to past tense (e.g., ‘shot’). There are five
Sentence Repetition items. Incidental Verbal Memory involves participants recalling the ten items
from Object Naming, Word Repetition and Comprehension subtests.

Note. Higher scores indicate better performance.
Spontaneous speech is assessed via a complex scene (Australian Beach Scene), with
participants instructed to describe the scene for one minute. The Cookie Theft Scene (Goodglass &
Kaplan, 1972) is then presented as a “goal” condition, with participants instructed to speak
continuously for one minute about the scene (Robinson et al., 2021b). Word Fluency tasks involve
naming as many words as possible in one minute under two conditions (Strauss et al., 2006):
phonemic (i.e., words beginning with S and B) and semantic (i.e., animals and fruits and vegetables).
‘B’ and ‘Fruit and Vegetables’ are “goal” conditions, in which participants have a goal of speaking
20% more words than ‘S’ and ‘Animals’, respectively, which increases language generation (Robinson
et al., 2021b). Motor Go-No-Go is based on Luria’s (1966) tapping task and requires participants to
copy finger tapping sequences performed by the assessor (e.g., assessor taps once, participant taps
once), and then reverse tapping rules (e.g., assessor taps once, participant taps twice). Sentence
Completion was developed based on the Hayling Sentence Completion Test (Burgess & Shallice,
1997) and requires participants to complete ten sentences read aloud by the assessor by producing
one word, under two conditions: Initiation (the sentence must be meaningful, e.g., “The lecture
should last about one…” hour) and Inhibition (the sentence must be non-meaningful, e.g. “The
lecture should last about one…” plant). Low Constraint initiation items increase selection demands
due to multiple competing responses becoming available, compared to High Constraint items which
have a dominant response (Robinson et al., 1998; 2005; 2021).
Creation of a Total BELS Score. Spontaneous Speech and Word Fluency subtests were
converted from words per minute to whole scores (see Scoring Manual for comprehensive
breakdown of how this was performed – Supplementary Material). Beach and Cookie Theft Scene
Description transcripts were analysed by neuropsychologists and research assistants to determine
speech quantity and quality (e.g., proportion of verbs, errors, topic-relatedness, and novel ideas).
Word Fluency scores were based on normative data by Tombaugh and colleagues (1996, as cited in
Spreen & Strauss, 1998).

Willison, 1991); Visual Object and Space Perception (VOSP) Incomplete Letters (Warrington &
James, 1991).
Tests were administered as per standard manual instructions. Premorbid functioning (NART
IQ) and visuospatial ability (VOSP Incomplete Letters) were considered most dissimilar to BELS
subtests (i.e., measuring distinct underlying cognitive processes) and were therefore used for
divergent comparisons. For convergent validity, comparable naming, word fluency, spontaneous
speech and sentence completion tests were available. Word Repetition, Word Comprehension and
Sentence Repetition were matched with the Hayling Sentence Completion Test (HSCT) Section A
(i.e., Initiation) due to the inherent task requirements of sentence comprehension and internal
word/sentence repetition. Word Repetition was also matched with Digit Span Forwards (repetition
of digits presented orally), and Sentence Repetition was matched with Digit Span Backwards
(additional requirements of working memory for repetition of a string of digits in reverse order).
Motor Go-No-Go was paired with Stroop Colour Word Test as both are inhibition tasks. Incidental
Verbal Memory was most comparable to the Memory for Intentions Screening Test (MIST) Short
Delay and Digit Span Backwards due to underlying memory processes (prospective memory and
working memory, respectively).
Statistical Analyses
Using IBM SPSS Statistics 27, an alpha level of .05 was set for all analyses. Outliers were not
removed as they represent natural variation and possible values in the population. Assumptions for
all analyses were met. Differences between stroke and control groups were investigated via
independent sample t-tests (and Mann-Whitney U tests for non-parametric data), with Bonferroni
correction applied for multiple comparisons across different BELS variables. ANOVAs (or Kruskal-
Wallis tests for non-parametric data) were used to compare left hemisphere stroke (LHS), right
hemisphere stroke (RHS) and controls. Post-hoc Tukey tests were used to follow up significant
results (or Mann-Whitney U tests in the case of non-parametric data), with Bonferroni correction
applied (α = .017). Convergent and divergent validity was assessed via bivariate Pearson’s
correlations (and Kendall’s tau-b correlations for non-parametric data due to being robust to the
effect of outliers; Field, 2013). Raw scores on BELS subtests were used in all correlational analyses
except Sentence Completion Initiation, where reaction times better reflect initiation processes
(Barker et al., 2020). Neuropsychology test scores used in correlational analyses are presented in
scores could predict healthy or stroke status, beyond demographic variables and baseline cognitive
function. Age, education, NART IQ and Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM; Raven, 1976)
were entered at Block 1, and total BELS scores at Block 2. A ROC curve analysis was performed to
determine the sensitivity and specificity of a total BELS score, and a total Propositional Language and
Executive Functions score.
Results
Missing Data
A missing data analysis of stroke patients’ data revealed 7% of values were missing. This was
unsurprising in an acute stroke setting where stroke severity and chronicity influences a patient’s
ability to complete testing. Due to the nature of this population, missing values were not estimated.
Participants were excluded pairwise from analyses if relevant data was missing.
Descriptive Statistics
significantly more education, higher premorbid (NART IQ) and fluid (Raven’s APM) intelligence, and
better visual perception (VOSP Incomplete Letters; notably, all but one patient performed close to
ceiling and within normal limits on this test). LHS and RHS did not significantly differ on any
demographic or baseline variable. Stroke patients performed significantly worse than controls on all
BELS subtests except Word Comprehension, Word Repetition, and Sentence Completion Initiation
impaired.
On almost all variables, both RHS and LHS patients performed significantly worse than
control participants; however, they did not significantly differ from each other (for all comparisons
follows: 1. Fluid intelligence (APM), H(2) = 24.11, p <.001, whereby RHS scored significantly lower
than controls, U = 752.50, p < .001, r = .46; 2. Beach Scene total scores, H(2) = 37.46, p <.001,
whereby both RHS and LHS scored significantly lower than controls , U = 949, p = .001, r = .32 and U
= 1466, p < .001, r = .62 respectively, and RHS scored significantly higher than LHS U = 328, p = .003, r
= .36; 3. Cookie Scene total scores, H(2) = 18.79, p <.001, whereby controls and RHS groups did not
significantly differ, and LHS scored significantly lower than both , U = 1279, p <.001, r = .45 and U =
368, p = .009, r = .31, respectively; 4. Spontaneous Speech total scores, H(2) = 39.70, p <.001, such
that RHS and LHS scored significantly lower than controls , U = 938.50, p = .001, r = .32 and U = 1486,
p <.001, r = .63, respectively, and RHS scored significantly higher than LHS, U = 278, p <.001, r = .42;
5. Sentence Completion Initiation Low Constrained scores, H(2) = 7.64, p = .025, whereby LHS
performed significantly lower than controls , U = 1165.50, p = .014, r = .25; 6. Sentence Completion
Initiation total scores, H(2) = 7.64, p = .022, whereby RHS scored significantly lower than controls , U
= 1406.50, p = .013; 7. Sentence Completion Inhibition High Constrained scores, H(2) = 44.88, p <
.001, whereby RHS and LHS scored significantly lower than controls , U = 546.50, p <.001, r = .59 and
U = 1399, p = .001, r = .32, respectively, and RHS scored significantly lower than LHS , U = 904.50, p =
.004, r = .33; and 8. Sentence Completion Inhibition High Constrained Reaction Times, H(2) = 8.58, p
= .014, whereby RHS were significantly slower than controls , U = 1989.50, p = .008, r = .25.

Logistic Regression
Predictive Validity
Stroke or healthy status was the outcome variable. To control for baseline group differences,
age, education, NART IQ (premorbid functioning) and Raven’s APM (general intelligence) were
entered at Block 1, which was significant, χ²(4, N = 122) = 34.53, p < .001. The model remained
significant at Block 2 when total BELS scores were entered as a predictor, χ²(5, N = 122) = 103.71, p
<.001. Non-significant Hosmer and Lemeshow tests indicated good fit for the data at Block 1, χ² =
5.35, p = .720, and Block 2, χ² = 4.86, p = .772. Cox and Snell and Nagelkereke R 2 indicated that at
Block 1, the model explained approximately 24.6 to 32.9% of the variance in stroke and healthy
outcomes. At Block 2, this increased to approximately 57.3 to 76.5%. The final model correctly
classified 92.3% of healthy cases (compared to 80% at Block 1), and 87.7% of stroke cases (compared
to 63.2% at Block 1). This suggested the inclusion of BELS total scores improved model sensitivity
(correct classification of stroke cases) and specificity (correct classification of healthy cases).
Wald statistics for Model 1 revealed only Raven’s APM and NART IQ significantly contributed
to the model (Wald χ 2 = 5.50, p = .019, 95%CI [.63, .96] and Wald χ 2 = 6.04, p = .014, 95%CI[.88, .99],
respectively); however, in Model 2, total BELS scores were the only unique significant predictor of
likely to be a stroke patient.

ROC Curve Analysis
ROC Curve analysis revealed the area under the curve was 0.94, p <.001, 95%CI [.91, .98]
healthy and stroke cases, which is considered excellent discrimination (Hosmer et al, 2013). A cut-off
score of 84.25/100 had .91 sensitivity (i.e., 91% true positive rate), and .80 specificity (i.e., 20% false
positive rate). The Positive Predictive Value (PPV) indicated an 82% likelihood that a participant with
a positive test result (i.e., scored below 84.25) was a stroke patient. The Negative Predictive Value
(NPV) indicated a 90% likelihood that a participant with a negative test result (i.e., scored above
84.25) was healthy. Finally, the likelihood ratio suggested a participant who scored below 84.25 was
4.55 times more likely to be a stroke patient.
ROC Curve for BELS Total Score (Acute Stroke and Controls)
A second ROC Curve analysis of the Executive Functions and Propositional Language
subsection total score demonstrated an area under the curve of .93, p < .001, 95%CI[.89, .97],
indicating a 93% chance of these scores discriminating between healthy and stroke cases. A cut-off
of 48.50/60 had .90 sensitivity, and .83 specificity. The likelihood ratio also indicated a score less
than 48.50/60 was 5.29 times more likely to be that of a stroke patient. Due to LHS being commonly
associate with language impairments post-stroke, this ROC curve analysis was repeated with
controls and LHS patients. There was an increase in area under the curve (.97, p <.001; 95%CI [.93,
1.00]) and sensitivity (.96 for a cut-off score of 48.5). Specificity remained at .83 (17% false positive
rate).
Discussion
Enhanced recovery and quality of life post-stroke is dependent on improved assessment of
acute cognitive impairments. Assessment must be brief, yet comprehensively test common cognitive
impairments known to predict long-term neuropsychological, functional, and emotional outcomes
(e.g., language, executive functions). We aimed to investigate the validity of a novel brief cognitive
screening test (the BELS), which addresses limitations of current testing in acute stroke. Specifically,
we aimed to determine convergent and divergent validity of BELS subtests to ensure cognitive
functions assessed in large neuropsychology batteries are being accurately measured. We
additionally investigated the predictive validity, sensitivity, and specificity of the BELS in
distinguishing acute stroke and healthy control participants.
Convergent validity was found for all but two BELS subtests. That is, Naming, Sentence
Repetition, Incidental Verbal Memory, and all Propositional Language and Executive Function
subtests accurately measure the cognitive processes they were designed to assess. The two BELS
subtests that did not demonstrate convergent validity had ceiling effects (Word Repetition and Word
Comprehension). These ceiling effects were consistent with a prior study investigating the BELS, and
were also considered necessary for completion and interpretation of scores on more difficult
subtests (e.g., Sentence Completion; Robinson et al., 2021). Time and fatigue constraints for patients
also resulted in directly comparable word comprehension and repetition tests being unavailable.
Digit Span Backwards was a secondary test selected to compare to Incidental Verbal Memory and
Sentence Repetition; however, was non-significantly correlated with either. This is perhaps
explained by a domain-specific account of working memory, which suggests numbers and words are
processed differently (Butterworth et al., 1996; Iuculano et al., 2011).
Divergent validity was established for every BELS subtest with at least one of the two
dissimilar neuropsychology tests. That is, all Oral Apraxia, Nominal Language, Propositional Language
and Executive Functions and Memory subtests were unrelated to premorbid intelligence and/or
visuospatial ability; indicating the BELS assesses distinct cognitive processes. Premorbid intelligence
(NART IQ), which has also been characterised as measuring crystallised intelligence, was significantly
correlated with Object Naming and Phonemic Word Fluency, likely because these tasks require
reliance on previously learned and stored knowledge (Cattell, 1963; Marriott & Care, 2004). The
significant relationship between NART IQ and Motor Go No-Go was unexpected; however, prior
research has established a link between NART IQ and suppression tasks (Brewin et al., 2012; Horn et
al., 2003). Lastly, significant relationships with VOSP Incomplete Letters (Oral Apraxia, Semantic
Word Fluency, and Sentence Completion) may be due to reliance on visual strategies in these
subtests (e.g., visually scanning room to generate responses for Sentence Completion or Word
Fluency; Gibson et al., 2019).
Predictive validity of a total BELS score was established. That is, total scores on the BELS
were able to significantly predict stroke or healthy status after controlling for age, education, and
intelligence (fluid and crystallised). However, prior to BELS scores being entered into the regression
model, fluid and crystallised intelligence were significant predictors of stroke or healthy status. This
may be explained, firstly by healthy participants’ significantly higher NART IQ and Raven’s APM
scores, secondly by links between premorbid intelligence (NART IQ) and post-stroke cognition
(Makin et al., 2018), and thirdly by the notion that fluid intelligence is linked to frontal lobe function
(Duncan et al., 1995). In Model 2, intelligence (fluid and crystallised) became non-significant, and
BELS total scores were the only unique significant predictor of stroke or healthy status. This suggests
total scores on the BELS provide more detailed insight into post-stroke cognition than age,
education, and premorbid and fluid intelligence. This is to be expected, considering the BELS taps
cognitive processes specifically impaired in acute stroke patients (i.e., language and executive
functions measured via propositional language, as well as memory).
Total scores on the BELS demonstrated excellent sensitivity (.91) and good specificity (.80)
when distinguishing between healthy and stroke cases. This was consistent with a recent study that
established sensitivity of the BELS in an acute stroke sample (Robinson et al., 2021). In comparison
to previous studies with similar sample sizes and groups (acute stroke patients and healthy controls),
the BELS is considerably more sensitive and specific than other cognitive screening tools. For
instance, Nys and colleagues (2005b) were unable to determine an MMSE cut-off score with
acceptable sensitivity (>.80) and specificity (>.60) when distinguishing acute stroke patients and
healthy controls. The MoCA has demonstrated better sensitivity (.81) and specificity (.70) than the
MMSE when differentiating these two groups (Potocnik et al., 2020), however it is not as sensitive or
specific as the BELS. It is important to acknowledge that the BELS is heavily dependent on language
and therefore is not entirely suitable for aphasic stroke patients. Yet it does compliment the Oxford
Cognitive Screen (OCS; Demeyere et al., 2015), which is a stroke-specific cognitive screening tool
that non-verbally assesses domains of attention, memory, numeracy, and praxis. If used in
conjunction, the BELS and the OCS would provide more comprehensive yet still brief insight into
cognitive processes commonly affected in acute stroke patients, as well as insight into recovery
trajectory.
The Propositional Language and Executive Functions subsection was also found to be highly
sensitive (.90) and have good specificity (.83) when distinguishing acute stroke from controls.
Sensitivity of this subsection increased to .96 when comparing LHS and controls, which suggests the
BELS Propositional Language and Executive Functions subtests are particularly sensitive to LHS
impairments. This aligns with prior research indicating involvement of the left frontal lobe in
propositional language post-stroke (Kiran, 2012; Price et al., 2010; Robinson et al., 1998; Robinson et
al., 2005; Robinson et al., 2021).
th
Up to 51% of stroke patients performed below the 5 percentile across individual BELS
subtests, which increased to 66% on both the Executive Functions and Propositional Language
subsection and total BELS scores. Nominal language was mostly unimpaired, meaning poor
performance on propositional language tasks is likely attributed to deficits in executive functions
critical for propositional language (e.g., initiation, inhibition, selection, strategy). Largely intact
nominal language is consistent with previous findings that demonstrate propositional language
impairments in non-aphasic stroke patients (e.g., Law et al., 2015). Therefore, in clinical settings,
speech and language therapists are unlikely to be involved in these patients’ acute stroke care. In
terms of hemispheric differences on BELS subtests, it was predominantly RHS patients performing
th
below the 5 percentile (except for Word Comprehension and Motor Go No-Go on which only one
LHS patient was impaired, and Spontaneous Speech total scores).
th
Most patients performing below the 5 percentile on Spontaneous Speech (words per
minute) were RHS (69-74%). However, the percentage of patients impaired on Spontaneous Speech
total scores (which reflect overall speech quality, i.e., grammar, errors, topic-relatedness, novel
ideas, and words per minute) was relatively equal (52-56% LHS). Follow-up comparisons (see
RHS, despite Spontaneous Speech quantity (words per minute) not differing between the two
groups. This may indicate that certain cognitive processes underlying spontaneous speech differ
depending on stroke hemisphere. RHS impairment on propositional language tasks is well-
documented in the literature (Barker et al., 2017; Blake, 2021; Bloom, 1994; Heweston et al., 2017),
however propositional language impairment in LHS indicates executive-level deficits occur after
damage to networks across brain hemispheres (Mackenzie & Brady, 2008; Robinson et al., 2021).
As expected, stroke patients showed poorer verbal initiation and selection on BELS Sentence
Completion (Initiation) compared to controls. Differences between LHS and RHS were found,
however. Firstly, the RHS group made more errors on the Initiation subtest than controls, despite
both LHS and RHS being slower to initiate a response than controls; consistent with prior research on
the Hayling Sentence Completion Test (Burgess & Shallice, 1996; Robinson et al., 2015). However, on
Low Constraint items (with higher selection demands) LHS made more errors than controls, which
suggests that although both groups demonstrated reduced verbal initiation, it is perhaps a verbal
selection deficit driving this impairment for LHS. This is consistent with previous findings indicating
the left inferior frontal gyrus is implicated in selection (Moss et al., 2005; Robinson 2013; Robinson
et al., 1998; Robinson et al., 2005; Robinson et al., 2010; Thompson-Schill et al., 1997; Zhang et al.,
2004). To our knowledge, hemispheric differences in high versus low constraint sentence completion
items in acute stroke have not been explored. Therefore, further investigation is required to better
understand and distinguish verbal initiation and selection impairments in acute stroke.
All stroke patients demonstrated poorer verbal inhibition than controls on the BELS
Sentence Completion (Inhibition) subtest, and RHS performed worse than LHS on High Constraint
items. High Constraint Initiation items elicit a more dominant response than Low Constraint items,
meaning more effort is required to suppress these prepotent responses on the Inhibition subtest
(Aron et al., 2014; Robinson et al., 2021). This aligns with prior research that suggests the right
hemisphere, and specifically the right inferior frontal cortex plays a key role in inhibition (Aron et al.,
2004; Aron et al., 2014; Garavan et al., 1999; Konishi et al., 1999; Robinson et al., 2015; Rubia et al.,
2003). Further, both LHS and RHS groups employed fewer strategies on the Inhibition subtest than
controls. Impairments to strategy selection and implementation have been established in frontal
lesion patients (Burgess & Shallice, 1996; Robinson et al., 2015; Robinson et al., 2016) and associated
with the left middle frontal gyrus in healthy adults (Collette et al., 2001). However, further
investigation of strategy use in stroke has critical implications for understanding neural networks or
regions involved, as well as a patient’s ability to engage in rehabilitation and recover (e.g., ability to
implement strategies to manage impairments). A benefit of the BELS Sentence Completion subtest is
that Initiation items are repeated for Inhibition, resulting in increased demands on inhibitory
processes which must override an already produced response (Aron et al., 2014; Butler & Zacks,
2006). This is an adaptation of the Hayling Sentence Completion Test (Burgess & Shallice, 1996),
which uses different items for Initiation and Inhibition tasks, meaning that although examinees must
suppress an automatic response that response has not already been produced.
The BELS assesses primary predictors of long-term stroke outcomes, meaning there is
potential for this tool to provide valuable information on the trajectory of stroke recovery. Further
investigation of whether the BELS (and its subsections) can predict long-term cognitive, functional,
and emotional outcomes would be beneficial to understanding the link between acute impairment
and long-term quality of life. The BELS can also detect gross visual perception impairments and
hemispatial inattention using Object Naming and Spontaneous Speech stimuli cards, which present
an array of 10 items on an A4 card. Visual neglect of one side may be indicated via omission of items
(e.g., only describing or naming items on the right-hand side of stimuli cards), as well as visual
perceptual disturbance via misidentification of items (e.g., Object Naming errors or object agnosia;
or errors identifying objects on Spontaneous Speech). Visual neglect and perceptual impairments are
also known predictors of long-term functional stroke outcomes, rehabilitation, and overall wellbeing
(Denes et al., 1982; Gall et al., 2010; Jehkonen et al., 2001; Mercier et al., 2001; Nijboer et al., 2013;
Sand et al., 2016; Stone & Greenwood, 1993). The validity of these BELS subtests as a brief visual
perception screen should be investigated.
A primary limitation of this study was the unavailability of optimal neuropsychology tests for
convergent and divergent analyses, which meant convergent validity was not established for all BELS
subtests. This was firstly due to the retrospective nature of the study, and secondly because large
neuropsychological batteries are unrealistic in an acute stroke population. Time and fatigue
constraints also resulted in incomplete testing for some patients, and consequently, results may be
reflective of level of impairment or chronicity. Further, a total BELS score requires completion of all
subtests, meaning patients who did not complete one subtest were excluded from logistic regression
and ROC curve analyses. Finally, we were unable to use parametric tests that control for the effect of
education and premorbid intelligence (e.g., via ANCOVAs) on BELS performance primarily due to the
nature of subtests for a screen and the data not following a normal distribution. Therefore, further
investigation of acute stroke and control groups matched on education and premorbid intelligence
would be beneficial in improving our understanding of how these factors influence BELS
performance.
The utility of the BELS is not limited to a stroke population. It also has clinical importance for
neurodegenerative conditions where highly sensitive, specific, and brief cognitive screens are
required. Brief tools like the MMSE have been found by meta-analysis to have, on average, 79.8%
sensitivity and 81.3% specificity when used in memory clinics for dementia patients (Mitchell, 2009).
Many cognitive processes assessed by the BELS are the first to decline during the onset of
Alzheimer’s Disease (e.g., propositional language, word retrieval, and memory; Kemper et al., 1993;
Lyons et al., 1994). An extended version of the BELS has recently been developed and includes
additional Verbal and Visual Recognition memory subtests, Sentence Comprehension, and more
difficult Object Naming, Word Repetition and Word Comprehension subtests (to detect more subtle
nominal language impairments). The BELS (Extended) takes approximately 30 minutes to complete
and provides additional insight into cognition of patients who can endure slightly longer assessment.
Upon validation in Mild Cognitive Impairment and dementia populations, the BELS would be a
valuable tool for early detection of cognitive decline. In dementia populations, cut-off scores for
BELS subsections would provide critical insight into the type and severity of cognitive impairment,
and additionally aid in tracking decline over time.
Constraints on Generality
As the cohort was drawn from the metropolitan area of Brisbane, Australia, it is overrepresented by
Caucasians and those from a Western cultural background. In addition, due to the BELS being
designed to assess language abilities, our inclusion criteria required English as the primary language.
Therefore, results cannot be generalised to the broader population, and validation in more diverse
samples should be investigated.
