Running head: RELIGIOSITY AND IMMORALITY 2
Abstract
Previous psychological research has provided mixed evidence for whether religious
individuals are more sensitive to moral violations compared to non-religious individuals.
Empirically, firstly, it is unclear whether religious individuals experience higher
physiological arousal to immorality, and secondly, if they do, whether this arousal is an
unconscious-intuitive response or whether it involves conscious awareness. In the current
research, we explored these two empirical questions. We explored the effects of backward
masked morally improper elicitors in religious and non-religious participants from
Singapore, using heart-rate assessment, and self-reports for the appraisal of immorality.
Religious and non-religious individuals did not show different self-report ratings for
immorality, although, surprisingly, religious individuals showed higher heart-rate
responses. These responses were reported only for hits but not for miss responses for
signal-detection performance. This suggests that religious individuals do, indeed,
experience higher physiological responsivity to immoral elicitors and that this effect
involves conscious awareness.

Introduction
Religion and morality have been examined as possibly related phenomena since
the beginnings of contemporary scientific inquiry (Bloom, 2012). While the relation
between religion and morality remains intensely controversial (Baumard & Boyer, 2013;
Galen, 2012), recent psychological models suggest that religious and non-religious
individuals may differ in many aspects of their moral cognitive processes. These include
foundational moral judgement principles (e.g., deontology vs. utilitarian; Piazza & Sousa,
2013), cognitive styles in moral decision making (McPhetres et al., 2018; Pennycook et
al., 2014), the perception of different elicitors as immoral themes (Graham & Haidt, 2010),
debates as to whether and the extent to which consciousness is involved in religious moral
processing (Tsikandilakis et al., 2021a), and differences in the physiological and appraisal
responses to immorality (Shariff, 2015).
In particular, previous research has provided some evidence showing that
automatic affective processes are essential antecedents for religious moral appraisal and
behaviour (Sevinc & Spreng, 2014). It is still unclear whether these automatic affective
processes involve conscious awareness. Moral intuitionist theories have laid the basic
framework for exploring the relevance of consciousness to religious moral processing
(Haidt, 2001). Moral intuitionist theories have been used to emphasise the role of
automatic and involuntary processes in moral decision making (Greene, 2007). They have
been interpreted to suggest that automatic responsivity to morally relevant information
enables one to cope with their immediate sociomoral context (Haidt & Joseph, 2004).
This line of argument has also been plied to support that, due to conscious, or unconscious
mechanisms (Tsikandilakis et al., 2021a), morality-related cues elicit automatic affective
responses (Haidt, 2001). These can manifest as physiological experiences with significant
Running head: RELIGIOSITY AND IMMORALITY 4
impact in moral appraisals and behaviours (De Freitas & Alvarez, 2018; Johnston et al.,
2013).
Within this context, a branch of research relating to the Behavioural Immune
System (BIS; Schaller, 2011) has laid the theoretical foundations to support that religious
individuals display heightened physiological sensitivity to moral impropriety (Curtis et
al., 2011). BIS refers to a cluster of intuitive, automatic and involuntary motivational
mechanisms that have evolved to protect an individual against pathogenic threats
(Schaller et al., 2015). These are suggested to comprise psychological mechanisms that
are oriented towards reacting to conscious (Panayiotou, Karekla, & Panayiotou, 2014) or
unconscious (Sasaki, Watanabe & Yamada, 2018) cues of pathogens, and trigger a suite
of precautionary affective, cognitive and behavioural responses (Schaller & Park, 2011).
The exploration of religiosity in relation to the BIS is also supported by social and
epidemiological phenomena, such as the correlation between the emergence of religions
and the spatial distribution of disease prevalence (Fincher & Thornhill, 2008; Wiebe,
2013). Anthropological researchers have discoursed that religions are characterised by
ritualistic prescriptions, such as cleansing and washing, that could have developed to
serve a protective function against disease (Clark, 2010). This has led to the proposition
that religions could have initially developed as intuitive systems in response to disease
stress (Clay et al., 2012; Fincher & Thornhill, 2008). These intuitive systems are
suggested to have predated the emergence of conscious moral reasoning (Shariff, 2015)
and could have further evolved, in contemporary religious settings, for the protection and
maintenance of moral purity (Schaller & Duncan, 2007).
This perspective has been used to suggest that religiosity could involve a specific
and distinct evolutionary trajectory for moral processing (Shariff, 2015). According to
this perspective, religious individuals could display heightened affective sensitivity
Running head: RELIGIOSITY AND IMMORALITY 5
towards immorality compared to non-religious individuals. This effect could occur
because this sensitivity contributes to the attainment and maintenance of moral purity.
This hypothesis has been supported and debated by previous research without uniform
and conclusive empirical or theoretical consensus as to its validity (for a comprehensive
review, see Saroglou & Craninx, 2020).
It is empirically unresolved whether this affective sensitivity is a real phenomenon
and – if it is – whether it is subject to unconscious psychological mechanisms, or whether
it involves conscious awareness (Omoniyi & Fishman, 2006; Shariff, 2015).To explore
these two empirical questions, in the current studies, we tested whether physiological
responses and self-reports for the appraisal of immorality are higher for religious
compared to non-religious individuals under conditions of backward masking, and
whether conscious awareness is involved in these responses.
In a first experimental study, images from the International Affective Picture
System (IAPS; Lang, Bradley & Cuthbert, 1997) were assessed and validated for showing
moral impropriety. In a second experimental study, these images were presented with
backward masking to religious and non-religious individuals. Heart-rate responses, and
evaluation-appraisal self-report responses for immorality were assessed. We explored
physiological and self-report responsivity to masked images of immorality. We
conducted dedicated signal-detection hits-versus-miss response analyses, such as
responses for seeing a presented face when it was presented and not seeing a presented
face when it was presented respectively, for both assessment types. Our aim was to
explore whether religious individuals experienced higher responsivity to immorality, and
whether conscious perception was involved in these responses (see Tsikandilakis, Bali,
Yu, Madan, Derrfuss, Chapman & Groeger, 2021; Tsikandilakis, Madan & Milbank,
2022a; 2022b).

Study One: Image Selection and Validation
Aims: The objective of this study was to select and empirically validate morally-
improper and morally-innocuous images for use in the next experimental stage
Participants: A power calculation based on medium effect sizes (g = .4; η = .06; f
= .25) revealed that a minimum of forty participants would be required to achieve a
power of P ≥.8 (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner & Lang, 2009). Forty-four undergraduates
(1 – β)
from the National University of Singapore (NUS) volunteered to participate in this
study. All participants were assessed for eligibility for being included in the current
study using the Somatic and Psychological Health Report Questionnaire (SPHERE-12;
Hickie et al., 2001). No participant scored above the SPHERE-12 threshold (> 3) that
would have indicated a possible psychiatric diagnosis. The final population sample
consisted of forty-four participants. The study received ethical approval from the
Department of Psychology of the National University of Singapore.
Participants were assigned to two groups based on their religious affiliation and
beliefs. One group included participants with religious affiliations and beliefs and one
group included participants without religious affiliations and beliefs. For the religiosity
group, the inclusion criteria were being affiliated with a religion, being a practising
member of the same religion and believing in the existence of the God or Gods of their
religion of practise and affiliation; assessed using self-reports (Zinnbauer et al., 2015).
For the non-religiosity group, the inclusion criteria were not being affiliated with a
religion, not being a practising member of a religion and not believing in the existence
of a God or Gods associated with an organized religion or spiritual/religious group;
assessed using self-reports (see Peterson & Ruse, 2016). The sample size sample
included twenty (ten female) religious individuals (M = 21.2, SD = 1.46). The
age
religious participants identified themselves as Buddhist (10%), Catholic (30%),
Running head: RELIGIOSITY AND IMMORALITY 7
Christian (50%) and Hindu (10%) . The population sample included twenty-four
age
Stimuli: 144 images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) received
ethical approval for the current study. The IAPS is commonly used in the study of
affective processing and includes standardised ratings for valence and emotional arousal
on nine-point scales. Three levels of valence (Negative, Neutral, Positive) and three
levels of arousal (Low, Moderate, High) were derived from the standardised ratings to
obtain nine categories of images (i.e., negative-valence/low-arousal, negative-
valence/moderate-arousal, negative-valence/high-arousal, neutral-valence/low-arousal,
neutral-valence/moderate-arousal, neutral-valence/high-arousal, positive-valence/high-
arousal, positive-valence/moderate-arousal, positive-valence/high-arousal). The stimuli
depicted images with themes that have been previously linked to moral impropriety,
such as partial nudity, violent intent and substance use (Ellemers et al., 2019), and
images without prior associations with impropriety, such as natural scenery, household
items, and everyday activities and interpersonal interactions (Lang & Bradley, 2007).
Images depicting animals, sexual scenes and physical violence were excluded. All
images were transformed to greyscale, resized to 1280 x 768 resolution and transformed
to visual vectors using CorelDRAW Technical Suite 2019 Pro (Wang, 2020). Pattern
blur images were also included in the experiment as control stimuli. The pattern blurs
were created using randomised pixel permutation in MATLAB (Bisht, Dua, Dua &
Jaroli, 2020). All images were averaged for luminance using the SHINE, MATLAB
Toolbox (Willenbockel et al., 2010; see also Tsikandilakis, Madan & Milbank, 2022a).
1 According to the distinction of religious affiliations in the Singaporean culture, Protestant Christians are
referred to as “Christians” and Catholic Christians as “Catholics” (Goh, 2010). These religious
denominations have been preserved and reported accordingly throughout the current manuscript to show
cultural respect and consideration for the denominations that the Singaporean culture uses and accepts.

Procedure: Participants were informed that the experiment would be investigating
individual differences in the perception of emotional stimuli, and that they would be
rating images for contextual characteristics. Participants were informed that one of these
characteristics was moral impropriety, and that ratings should be made subjectively and
according to their own values (Brinkmann, 2010; p. 145-151). The presentation was
programmed using the builder and coder components of PsychoPy v3.0 (Pierce, 2007).
The experiment included 192 trials, presented in randomised sequence, to include an
equal number of presentations for each image category (144 IAPS image trials,
including 16 images per image category, and 48 pattern blurs). Each trial started with a
fixation cross (1s), followed by a single IAPS or pattern image displayed at fixation (1s)
and then followed by a black-and-white pattern mask (1s). The black and white pattern
mask was included to control for differences in the presentation sequence between this
study and study two that included backward masking (see Tsikandilakis, Bali, Derrfuss
& Chapman, 2020a; 2020b). After the mask, a blank screen was presented (1s).
Subsequently, participants were asked to rate, in Likert scales from one to nine, using
the mouse, the emotional intensity, valence and moral impropriety of the presented
images by responding to the following questions: “How emotionally intense was the
first image (1 = Not at all, 5 = Moderately, 9 = Extremely)?”; “How pleasant or
unpleasant was the first image (1 = Extremely unpleasant, 5 = Neutral, 9 = Extremely
pleasant)?”; “How morally improper was the first image (1 = Not at all, 5 = Moderately,
9 = Extremely)?”. For each trial, each question was presented on a separate slide with
order randomised.
After the completion of the experimental part of study one, participants were
asked to complete a series of questionnaires that measured their emotional sensitivity,
morality-related life-experiences and religious beliefs, with the order of the
Running head: RELIGIOSITY AND IMMORALITY 9
questionnaires randomized (Shulruf, Hattie & Dixon, 2008; Carpenter & Marshall, 2009;
Tsikandilakis, Bali, Haralabopoulos, Derrfuss & Chapman, 2020). These questionnaires
included the Emotional Reactivity Scale (ERS; Nock, Wedig, Holmberg & Hooley,
2008), the Moral Foundations Questionnaire-20 (MFQ-20; Graham et al., 2011) and the
Santa Clara Strength of Religious Faith Questionnaire (SCSORF; Plante & Boccaccini,
1997). These questionnaires were administered after the completion of the experiment
to control for priming effects for the appraisal of immorality during the experimental
part of study one. Critically, they were administered to explore whether potential
differences between the two groups were due to differences in religious beliefs, or
confounding variables such as emotional sensitivity and non-religiosity-related moral
attitudes and opinions (see Tsikandilakis et al., 2019; p. 923, Tsikandilakis et al., 2021;
Image Selection: Morally-improper and innocuous images were selected. Fifteen
images with the highest and lowest mean impropriety ratings, respectively, were chosen
(for image codes, see Supplemental Material D).
Analyses and Discussion: Gosset’s independent and within-subjects t-tests were used
instead of a Welch’s t-test analysis in this section due to unequal sample sizes (Ross &
Willson, 2017). Hedges’ g was used as an alternative to Cohen’s d for effect size
calculations, because it is a more accurate estimation of weighted sample size
differences for unequal sample sizes (Lovakov & Agadullina, 2017). Throughout the
analyses we used traditional significance testing and Bayesian analyses. The latter was
used because significance testing cannot provide us with evidence for the null. This
method can only provide us with evidence that we have failed to reject the null
hypothesis that two variables were not significantly different (Dienes, 2014). Bayesian
analysis can provide direct evidence for null differences between two, or more, groups
Running head: RELIGIOSITY AND IMMORALITY 10
or variables. Bayesian analysis requires a lower and an upper bound, the standard error
of the population sample and a simple deduction of sample means to provide a Bayes
Factor (BF). Using these parameters we can calculate a BF that will signify at BF < .33
direct evidence for the null, at .33 < BF < 3 that the results are inconclusive and at BF >
3 evidence for the likelihood of the data being observed under the alternate hypothesis.
To explore whether morally improper and morally innocuous images differed in
moral impropriety ratings, a t-test comparison was conducted between the two image
types. The analysis revealed that impropriety ratings were significantly higher for
improper images compared to morally innocuous images (t(43) = 22.6, p < .001, g =
2.44). Morally-improper images were significantly higher for moral impropriety (M =
6.62, SD = 1.51) compared to morally-innocuous images (M = 3.54, SD = 1.09; p < .001;
g = 2.34; M = 3.08; LB = -1; HB = 1;SE = .01; BF = +∞). These results

suggested that the selected images were appropriate for inclusion in the next
experimental stage.
Furthermore, we, also, wanted to thoroughly explore whether there were group
differences for the appraisal of immorality, valence and intensity that could indicate that
the selected could differentially influence religious and non-religious groups in the next

= - 1.19, p = .24, g = .36) and intensity ratings (t(43) = .76, p = .45, g = .23). For morally
innocuous images, there were Bayesian evidence and trends for Bayesian evidence for
null differences, and no significant group differences for impropriety ratings (t(43) =
1.6, p = .12, g = .4), valence ratings, (t(43) = .36, p = .72, g = .11), and intensity ratings
These results indicated that morally improper and morally innocuous images did not

differ as regards their ratings for valence, intensity and moral impropriety between the
two groups and would not differentially influence religious and non-religious samples
in the next experimental stage.

Aims: The objective of this study was to test whether heart-rate changes and self-reports
for the appraisal of immorality were higher for religious compared to non-religious
participants in response to backward masked morally improper images. We explored if

Participants: Factoring in the number of trial repetitions in this stage (k = 60; see Szucs
& Ioannidis, 2017; Baker et al., 2020; Tsikandilakis, Madan & Milbank, 2022b), a power

slightly larger number of participants to control for possible data exclusion due to
movement artefacts and irregular heart-rate patterns during the physiological assessment
(Cacioppo, Tassinary & Berntson, 2007; p. 227-241). 125 NUS undergraduates
volunteered to take part in this study. The criteria for inclusion and participant
assessments and questionnaires in this study were identical to study one. The
questionnaires were administered after the completion of the main stage of the experiment,
to control for priming effects in the appraisal of immorality.
Data from five participants were excluded due to movement artefacts. Data from
two participants were excluded due to irregular heart-rate patterns. Data from one
participant were excluded due to SPHERE-12 scores that indicated a possible psychiatric
disorder. One participant was excluded from the study due to misconduct. The final
sample comprised 116 participants, including 58 religious participants (31 female; M

Procedures: Participants were informed that the experiment would be investigating
individual differences in the perception of masked emotional stimuli. The term masked
was explained thoroughly in the information sheet document and participants were
encouraged to ask for further clarifications from the researcher; no instances of further
inquiries reported. Participants undertook the experiment in a single-cubicle psychology
lab, on an HD Lenovo monitor set at 60 Hz (16.67 ms). The experiment was coded in
PsychoPy v3.0. Participants were instructed to remain seated during the experiment. The
heart-rate sensor was attached to the index finger of the participants’ non-dominant hand
and two minutes of rest were allowed for heart rate to stabilise before the experiment
started (Cacioppo, Tassinary & Berntson, 2007; p. 229-231).

presented in randomised sequence. Each trial started with a fixation cross (1s) and was
sequentially followed by a single IAPS or pattern image at fixation (50 ms), a backward
mask (100ms) and a blank screen (7s) . After the blank screen, participants responded to
detection and the rating of confidence for detection, and rating of moral impropriety. The
respective items were: “Was a real-life image presented (Yes/No)?”, “How confident are
you for your response (1 = Not at all, 5 = Moderately, 9 = Extremely)?”, and “How
morally improper did you experience the presentation (1= Not at all, 5 = Moderately, 9 =
Extremely)?” Responses were made using the mouse. A 7s inter-trial blank screen was
presented to allow heart rate to return to baseline.

Analyses and Discussion: Self-Report Appraisal and Physiological Responses: To
explore whether religious participants reported higher ratings for immorality, compared
to non-religious participants, responses for the appraisal of immorality were analysed for
the two groups. A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted with Group Type (religious
and non-religious) as the between-subjects variable and Image Types (improper,
innocuous and pattern images) as a within-subjects variable. No significant differences
were reported for rating responses for immorality (F(1, 115) = 1.03, p = .59, η = .02).

Discussion
In the current manuscript, we explored two important and challenging research
questions. The first question was whether religious individuals displayed higher
physiological responses to masked morally improper images compared to non-religious
individuals. The second question was whether religious individuals experienced
potentially higher physiological responses to masked immoral elicitors that were
unconscious, or they involved conscious awareness. Rigorous stimulus selection
procedures and strict criteria for the assessment of unconsciousness were used for
exploring these research questions.
In a first experimental stage, a subset of morally improper and morally innocuous
set of images was carefully selected from the IAPS database. In a second experimental
Running head: RELIGIOSITY AND IMMORALITY 20
stage, physiological responses to these images under conditions of backward masking
showed that religious individuals experienced higher heart-rate changes compared to non-
religious individuals. This finding included higher than chance-level detection
performance, using non-parametric receiver operating characteristics, and higher
physiological responses only for hits for signal detection performance for morally
improper images. These outcomes suggest that religious individuals can be more
physiologically responsive to immorality. In contrast to propositions of evolutionary
models relating to the unconscious-intuitional and disease-stress emergence and
retainment mechanisms of religious morality (see Shariff, 2015), this effect occurred only
for trials that involved conscious meta-cognition, such as the ability to correctly recall
that a masked image was presented in a posttrial signal detection engagement task, and,
therefore, did not endorse these evolutionary perspectives (Omoniyi & Fishman, 2006; p.
237-241; Shariff, 2015; p. 11-13).
An important and unexpected finding of the current studies related to the selection
of the immoral elicitors. These were selected by participants during a first experimental
stage. These elicitors involved predominantly violent intent and legal violations (see
Supplemental Material D.). This aspect of image selection could reflect cultural norms in
Singapore, that is a country that has a strict legal system that imposes severe penalties for
crimes relating to violent intent (Tan, 2000). Additionally, the image selection could be
culture specific in the sense that the Singaporean culture has philosophical origins in
Taoism and Buddhism that advocate anti-violence and anti-legal-violation doctrines
(Wang, 2014). This specificity in the selection of immoral images – relating as previously
stated to violent intent and illegal behaviours – had not been reported in previous studies
with different national-identity population samples (Tsikandilakis et al., 2021a; 2021b).

There are discrepancies in the existing literature regarding the correlation between
religiosity and the moral foundations of care and harm. Several studies have demonstrated
a positive but weak correlation between religiosity and care/harm sensitivity, while others
have reported non-significant correlations (Saroglou & Craninx, 2020; Yi & Tsang, 2020).
These studies measured participants’ endorsement of the MFQ subscales. In the present
study, although there were no significant differences between religious and non-religious
participants on the MFQ Harm subscale, religious participants displayed higher affective
sensitivity towards violent intent and legal violations. Given these differences between
self-reports and physiological responses, we suggest that assessing automatic and
involuntary responses could offer important insights on the association between
religiosity and immorality (see also Yu, Bali, Tsikandilakis & Tong, 2022).
In conclusion, the current research extended a grounded response to the
controversy as regards the nature of physiological responses to immorality by religious
individuals: Religious individuals experienced higher physiological arousal than non-
religious individuals to masked immoral elicitors. In the sense that subliminality is
conceptualized as the inability to recall the presentation of an elicitor (Dehaene,
Changeux, Naccache, Sackur & Sergent, 2006; Demertzi et al., 2019), the current findings
support that physiological responses to immoral elicitors involved the conscious detection
of a presented elicitor, and did not occur for miss responses, such as responding that an
immoral elicitor was not presented when an immoral elicitor was shown during an
experimental trial. These findings are in antithesis with moral-intuitionist and behavioral
immune system evolutionary theories as to that religious morality involves retained
unconscious response mechanisms that are potential antecedents of the emergence of
religion as a response to pathogen threat and disease stress (Schaller et al., 2015).

Considerations for Further Research
The current studies were conducted in Singapore. They could reflect cultural and
religious-specific characteristics. Further research could benefit from a cross-cultural
replication of the current findings. The current research included masked stimuli
presented for an arguably high duration which was, nevertheless, chosen on the grounds
that previous research has provided repeated evidence for subliminal responses to discrete
and adjective visual characteristics in complex and contextual stimuli from the IAPS (see
Hoffmann et al., 2012; Windey, Gevers & Cleeremans, 2013; Peláez et al., 2016; Wu,
Zhang & Yuan, 2020). Despite the fact that the current threshold for stimuli presentation
could be considered high in duration, an intriguing finding of the current research was
that we were able to report higher physiological arousal but not able to report higher
participant ratings in response to immoral images for religious individuals. This suggests
that further research could benefit from the replication of the current design using a
variety of different thresholds – both higher and lower than the threshold employed in the
current design – to explore if there is a threshold of higher explicit appraisal reports in
response to immoral elicitors (Brownell, Kloser, Fukami & Shavelson, 2013). A further
consideration is that religious individuals are able to retain their objectivity in appraising
immoral elicitors due to evaluative cognitive self-regulation despite experiencing high
subjective physiological arousal (Vieten, Scammell, Pilato, Ammondson, Pargament,
Lukoff, 2013; Beit-Hallahmi, 2014). The latter possibility, for which we have provided
some preliminary evidence in the current manuscript, has not been tested by previous
psychological research and could offer significant insights in religious cognition.
Conclusions
In the current study the question of whether religious individuals experience
higher physiological responsivity to immorality compared to non-religious individuals
Running head: RELIGIOSITY AND IMMORALITY 23
was explored. The question of whether religious individuals experience potentially higher
physiological responses to immorality that involve consciousness was also explored. The
findings of the current research were that religious individuals experience higher
physiological responsivity to masked immoral elicitors. The findings of the current
research were that these responses involved conscious meta-cognition, such as the ability
to correctly recall – upon explicit inquiry – that a masked image was presented during an
experimental trial. The current research also provided two important secondary findings.
Firstly, Singaporean participants almost exclusively selected violent intent and legal
violations as immoral elicitors. Secondly, although religious individuals experienced
higher physiological arousal to immoral images, they did not rate these same presented
images as more immoral compared to non-religious individuals. These findings can
motivate further research to explore consciousness, unconsciousness, immorality and
religiosity, and the outcome diversity for their assessment methods.
