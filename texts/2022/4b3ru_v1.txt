As societal discussion on the public opinion of science and technology continually ignites,
understanding where such opinions are rooted is increasingly relevant. A handful of prior
studies have pointed towards personality traits as potentially influential for individual
attitudes towards science. However, these report mixed findings, and employ small student,
convenience or scientist samples. This leaves considerable uncertainty regarding
personality traits’ relation to attitudes towards science. If in fact stable psychological
predispositions play a role in public opinion of science, this has considerable implications for
science policy and science communication. This paper investigates the relationship between
the big five personality traits and science attitudes in Germany and the Netherlands.
Findings indicate that personality traits are related to science attitudes but only weakly so,
among them openness to experience and neuroticism are most notably related to science
attitudes, whereas extraversion, in contrast to prior studies, shows no relation to science
attitudes.

1. Introduction
Scholars of public opinion of science have produced extensive knowledge of individual level
predictors of science attitudes. Most prominently, we understand that (though perhaps not
fully how) knowledge of science relates to increased appreciation of science (Allum et al.,
2008; Miller, 1983; Miller et al., 1997; Sturgis & Allum, 2004), how religious views matter for
how people relate to science (Ecklund et al., 2017; Gauchat, 2008; Jelen & Lockett, 2014;
McPhetres & Zuckerman, 2018; Simpson & Rios, 2019), and how ideology and partisanship
play a role in which groups are more prone to exhibit positive attitudes towards science
(Gauchat, 2012; McCright et al., 2013; Nisbet et al., 2015; Pechar et al., 2018). However, while
these themes have taken center stage, other individual level characteristics have received less
attention. While personality traits are broadly recognized as a relevant predictor within
neighboring fields of attitudinal research (notably within the study of ideology; Duckitt &
Sibley, 2010; Jost et al., 2008), such psychological predispositions have received little
attention in the study of public opinion of science and technology. Knowledge of how stable
personality traits relate to science could inform us on how to approach science-society
relations, could help us better understand to which degree we should expect public opinion of
science to change across time, and to which degree outreach from science and technology
should be influential in engaging the public.
Few prior studies investigate how personality is connected to science attitudes, and all but one
employ either student or convenience samples. Moreover, the central question in previous
research has been how personality might affect interest in science and academic success.
Findings from student populations might not reflect the general population, and while
understanding who are interested in doing science, general disposition towards science has
much more far reaching implications for science-society relations: If some people are more
likely to dislike science and technology due to psychological traits, this could have profound
implications for science communication, institutional outreach, and engagement with science.
Public opinion of science matters for science policy, impact of science and the legitimacy of
the societal authority of science. If we are to understand the public’s position, understanding
the role of psychological predispositions is a crucial point of interest.
1.1 The big five personality traits
Personality traits are “stable (behavioral) tendencies of a person linked to motivational,
emotional and cognitive domains over time and across situations” (Montag & Elhai, 2019, p.
128). Based on consistent findings of a common structure of personality throughout the 20th
century, scholars converged on a five factor model of personality. The five traits included in
the model are extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness to experience (/open-
mindedness), and neuroticism (/negative emotionality) (Digman, 1990; McCrae & John, 1992;
Montag & Elhai, 2019). While different measurements and conceptualizations exist (e.g.
including a sixth honesty–humility dimension; Lee & Ashton, 2018), the dominance of these
five traits in the conceptualization of personality stands to this day (Corr & Matthews, 2020).
The most cited quality of personality traits is the stability that they exhibit, both in terms
stability in time, but also in being an access point to the psychological “nature” of individuals
by getting at genetically inheritable components of human psychology. The possible genetic
roots of personality has received quite some interest, primarily studied in twin studies
producing quite extensive support for claims that personality has a genetic component, (see
meta studies; Polderman et al., 2015; Sanchez‐Roige et al., 2018). With regards to consistency
in time, results indicate consistency in personality, even across a lifetime (Damian et al., 2019).
However, personality does change as individuals mature and experience specific
environments (Edmonds et al., 2008). Moreover, the degree to which personality changes in
Page 2 of 11
adults varies across individuals, and also seems to have genetic components (Bleidorn et al.,
2009). Summing up, personality traits exhibit stability in time and have genetic components,
but people do change as they interact with each other and the world.
1.2 Does personality predict science attitudes?
Science attitudes refer broadly to attitudes about science and technology, interest in science,
and perceptions of the societal role of science. A broad range of attitudinal constructs have
been proposed and investigated through the history of the Public Understanding of Science
literature, from the classic measure of promise of science (Miller et al., 1997), to recent
developments in trustworthiness of scientists (Besley et al., 2021; Hendriks et al., 2015; Reif
& Guenther, 2021) and science-related populism (Mede et al., 2022). Existing knowledge on
how personality traits affect science attitudes is, however, scant.
In the first paper to investigate personality traits and science attitudes, Feist (2012) finds that
conscientiousness, extraversion and openness to experience relate to interest in science, and
that all personality traits but neuroticism relate to some form of science attitudes, across a
battery of science related attitude (science as limited, critical thinking, and required public
understanding). Similarly, Tommasi et al. (2020) investigate relationships between the big
five and science attitudes (mostly dimensions of interest in science), paranormal beliefs and
competence in science (measures of field-specific science knowledge). Findings regarding
these are mixed, though all traits but agreeableness relate to some forms of science attitudes.
Related studies find that personality does not predict views on alternative medicine (Furnham,
2007), while need for cognition is positively related to science attitudes (Feist, 2012; Kudrna
et al., 2015; Mather, 2009), sensation-seeking positively predicts propensity to talk about
science (Hwang & Southwell, 2007), and empathy matters for perceptions of science-society
relations and support for ethically questionable research (Jach & Buczek, 2021; Ruisch et al.,
2021). Additionally, multiple studies find that academic performance relates to personality
(Chamorro-Premuzic & Furnham, 2003; Eyong et al., 2014; Hakimi et al., 2011; Hong & Lin,
2011), two studies indicate that personality predicts belief in “pseudoscience” such as astrology
(Andersson et al., 2022; García‐Arch et al., 2022), and a recent study finds that covid-related
behavior is predicted by personality traits (Hartmann & Müller, 2022).
1.2 Aims for this study
It seems that personality and related psychological predispositions relate to science attitudes,
but existing studies investigate this almost exclusively in student and convenience samples,
findings are far from uniform, samples are generally small, and studies diverge from standard
attitudinal measures used in the public understanding of science literature. In this study, I
investigate the relationship between the big five personality traits and the most broadly
investigated promise of science questions (Miller et al., 1997) in a sample of German and Dutch
participants.
To test the expectation that personality relates to science attitudes I perform a series of
analyses on the world values survey round 6 (Inglehart et al., 2018). This survey round
includes both a 10-item battery on personality, as well as a variation of the standard promise
of science battery. The personality measure in this specific dataset has received considerable
critique due to poor within-traits correlations outside of western populations (Ludeke &
Larsen, 2017), as is often the case outside of WEIRD populations (Laajaj et al., 2019).
However, Lu and Cui (2022) recently reexamined the WVS data, and found that issues are
largely due to translations errors (notably into Arabic), acquiescence bias and measurement
equivalence (the latter isolated to countries not included here). Based on this, I present results

for Germany and the Netherlands to avoid potential issues in fielding the instrument outside
of WEIRD countries, but I also adjust for acquiescence.
2. Methods
2.1 Participants
This study employs the World Values Survey round 6 data (Inglehart et al., 2018), using
nationally representative samples from Germany (n=2046) and the Netherlands (n=1902,
total n=3948). The data was collected in 2013 in Germany and in the 2012 in the Netherlands.
2.2 Procedure
The relationship between the big five and science attitudes are investigated in multivariate
OLS regressions including all traits simultaneously and controlling for country, age, and sex.
2.3 Materials
2.3.1 10-item BFI
The World Values Survey Round 6 measures personality with the BFI-10 instrument
(Rammstedt et al., 2010). Having a short instrument could produce measurement issues,
though such are widely used and generally tend to have acceptable psychometric
characteristics (Ziegler et al., 2014). As proposed by Lu and Cui (2022), I follow the method
from Smith (2004) to correct for acquiescence, by subtracting the mean score across all items
within individuals, and then standardizing the individual item-scores within country. Internal
consistency is generally acceptable, though agreeableness has a slightly lower than desirable
level (α-levels: Extraversion=.64, Agreeableness=.42, Conscientiousness=.59,
Neuroticism=.69, Openness to experience=.59).
2.3.2 Science attitudes
To measure science attitudes I use a group of widely used and longstanding measures of
individual views on the promise of science and reservations towards science (Miller et al.,
1997). These ask respondents to evaluate a series of statements regarding science, scaled from
1 to 10. For ease of reading these are recoded so positive evaluation of science is always high
(reversed items are indicated by “rev” in visualizations). Full wording of all six questions are
2.3.3 Control variables
Country is measured with a dichotomous variable (Germany is reference), so is sex (female is
reference). Age is measured in years.
3. Results
Before proceeding to the main analyses, I investigate how the six science attitudes relate to the
between the big five personality traits and the six science attitudes. The relationships are
visualized both using loess (to see potential non-linear relationships) as well as linear
estimation, as is the generally assumed relationship. Moreover, the first row shows non-

standardized science attitudes, for readability, while the two last rows show standardized
science attitudes, to better display general patterns.
six science attitudes.
Notes: Top two rows show the bivariate relationship using loess (locally estimated
scatterplot smoothing) estimation, to illustrate potential non-linear relationships. The top
row shows raw science attitude scores (1-10), for readability. The two bottom rows show
standardized science attitude scores, to illustrate general patterns. The bottom row shows
linear relationships between personality traits and science attitudes.
The first finding of interest is that the correlations are generally quite weak. It does not seem
that personality is a strong predictor of science attitudes, though some traits do have clear
connections to science attitudes generally. Second, while openness and neuroticism show
consistent (and the strongest) correlations across questions, extraversion, agreeableness and
conscientiousness are weakly and/or non-uniformly connected to the individual science
attitudes. Moreover, while it is for the most part reasonable to argue for a linear correlation
between personality traits and science attitudes, it seems that some personality traits, to the
degree that they are related to science attitudes are so in a slightly non-linear fashion.
intervals for seven models per personality trait. One model for each individual attitude, and a
model for a composite additive science attitude scale. These models control for country, age,
Page 5 of 11
and sex, and include all five personality traits simultaneously. All variables are standardized
Notes: Coefficients and 95 % intervals for seven multivariate OLS regressions, showing
correlations for personality traits controlling for all other traits as well as country, age, and
sex.
Agreeableness is only very weakly connected to science attitudes. For the composite measure
regression, the regression coefficient is .04. For the items on making lives better, creating
opportunities, and making the world better, similar weak correlations are observed, while
agreeableness is not related to the questions on depending on science rather than religion, the
question about breaking down morals, or perceived importance of science knowledge.
Conscientiousness similarly is weakly related to science attitudes as such, the composite
measure model returns a coefficient of .05. However, whereas conscientiousness is also not
related to perceptions on depending on science rather than faith and breaking down morals,
it is most strongly related to perceived importance of interest in science. For the last three
items, on how science makes lives, the world, and opportunities better, conscientiousness
exhibits weak correlations.
Extraversion seems not to relate meaningfully to any science attitudes. Only the model on the
question on relying too much on science rather than religion, returns a statistically significant
result, and again only very weakly so.
Neuroticism has a more substantial correlation with science attitudes. The composite measure
model returns a coefficient of -.10. Though still a weak correlation, this is much more
substantial in comparison to the three prior traits. Interestingly, neuroticism is not related to
the question on perceived importance of science knowledge. The strongest correlations are for
the perceived consequences of science, making lives better, creating opportunities for future
generations and making the world better off.

Finally, openness to experience has the strongest relation to science attitudes. The estimate in
the composite measure model is .13. In contrast to neuroticism, this is most strongly the case
for perceived importance of knowledge of science. For the rest of the models openness exhibit
smaller coefficients, though once again strongest for the items the items on how science affects
the world, making lives better, creating opportunities, making the world better, rather than
the items on the moral position of science.
Overall, personality relates only weakly to science attitudes. While neuroticism and openness
seem clearly related to general perceptions of science, this is not the case for the other three
personality traits.
4. Discussion and Conclusion
This study follows previous studies in hypothesizing that science attitudes should be affected
by the big five personality traits. However, whereas previous studies have investigated this
almost exclusively among student and convenience samples, this study investigates this same
connection among the general population and in a much larger representative sample. Two
central findings should be highlighted:
First, as in previous studies, I find indications that personality traits have inconsistent
relations to different science attitudes. Taken together with prior studies, this might indicate
cross-contextual (i.e. different countries or cultures) as well as cross-domain (i.e. different
aspects of science) variations in how personality traits matter for public attitudes towards
science.
Second, the personality traits most strongly related to science attitudes are neuroticism and
openness to experience. The fact that openness to experience is the strongest predictor of
science attitudes is consistent with previous studies. However the correlations for neuroticism
seem unique to this study. This is potentially an artefact of prior studies investigating student
attitudes, where unease regarding science might conceivably be lower. It is puzzling that
extraversion shows no clear relation to science attitudes in this study, as introversion is usually
associated with scientists (Feist & Gorman, 1998), and extraversion has been demonstrated to
be negatively related to interest in science in student samples (Feist, 2012). However, in the
general population extraversion does not seem to play an important role. Moreover, consistent
findings that conscientiousness matters for academic performance might motivate predictions
of conscientiousness playing a central role for science attitudes. But this seems to not be the
case, except for perception of importance of interest in science. In fact agreeableness, which
has previously not been highlighted for playing a role regarding science attitudes, seems as
influential as conscientiousness.
While this single study cannot definitively settle how personality traits relate to public
attitudes towards science, it does provide a look at such correlations in a representative
general population sample. Centrally, my findings indicate that personality traits are not the
rock on which public opinion of science is build. Though some personality traits do relate to
some science attitudes, they do so weakly. This might be expected for distant predictors, but
still this tells a tale of caution when arguing that psychological predispositions are core
features to the formation of science attitudes. If some people simply do not like science, it is
not solely because of personality traits. Personality traits and other stable psychological factors
might play a role in public perceptions of science, but based on the above findings only to a
minor degree.
