Abstract (200/200)
Guilt aversion, which describes the tendency to reduce the discrepancy between a partner’s
expectation and his/her actual outcome, is a key driving force for cooperation in both the
East and the West. A recent study based on functional magnetic resonance imaging and
online behavioral experiments reported that men show stronger guilt aversion than
women and also suggested that men’s predominance in guilt aversion arises from stronger
sensitivity to social norms. However, since the participants of that study were all
Japanese, it remains unaddressed how common the gender difference in guilt aversion is.
Here, we conducted online behavioral studies on people from Korea and the U.K. (Korea;
n = 294, U.K.; n = 347) using the same trust game. We confirmed that men exhibit
stronger guilt aversion than women in both countries. Furthermore, consistent with the
Japanese study, our Lasso regression analysis for U.K. participants revealed that Big Five
Conscientiousness (rule-based decision) correlated with guilt aversion in men. In contrast,
guilt aversion in Korean men correlated with Big Five Neuroticism. Thus, our results
suggest that gender differences in guilt aversion is universal but the underlying cognitive
processes may be influenced by cultural differences.
Introduction
Previous research has indicated gender differences in socioeconomic behaviors such as
occupational choice [1,2,3,4], judicial rulings [5,6], medical practice patterns [7], and
educational decisions [8]. It is often hypothesized that these differences are caused by
different social preferences between genders.
Indeed, a large body of evidence has reported gender differences in social
preferences (for example, trust, reciprocity, altruistic, inequality averse and competitive
preference; for a review, see [9]). Guilt aversion is an important factor of cooperation that
lives up to the expectations of others, since people suffer from guilt if they disappoint
others [10,11,12,13] (see Materials and Methods for a more detailed definition). Both
laboratory and field experiments have supported this theory for populations in both the
East and the West (e.g., East [14,15,16], West [11,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24]).
Although guilt-aversion depends on one’s own beliefs about the underlying
intention of others, a comparison of behavioral outcomes between the self and other is
also important for social decision making [25]. Inequity aversion [26] is the most
perceived form of outcome-based decision making, which is defined as the propensity to
avoid an imbalance between outcomes for the self and the other. Additionally, empirical
evidence has revealed gender differences in inequity aversion [9].
However, only a limited number of reports have examined gender differences in
guilt aversion. It is possible that gender differences in guilt aversion reflect the different
cognitive strategies used by men and women. Specifically, guilt aversion requires the
ability to assess another individual’s expectations, and it is directly related to his/her
disappointment (i.e., empathy or theory of mind [27]). Moreover, guilt aversion
represents psychological pressure, and it is directly related to the sensitivity of negative
emotions (i.e., the sensitivity of negative emotions [10]). At the same time, guilt aversion
is a normative behavior elicited by experience (i.e., rule-based decision making [28]).
Hence, if there are gender differences in guilt aversion, these three potential cognitive
strategies—empathetic consideration, the sensitivity of negative emotion, and rule-based
decision making—may contribute to such differences.
Our recent study [15] based on functional magnetic resonance imaging and online
behavioral (Japanese participants; n = 4,723; 2,737 women) experiments reported that
men show stronger guilt aversion than women. The study also revealed that the Big Five
conscientiousness (rule-based decision making) correlates only with guilt aversion in
men, while Big Five agreeableness (empathetic consideration) correlates with guilt
aversion in both genders. This observation suggests that the consideration of social norms
plays a key role in men’s predominance in guilt aversion. However, the study was based
on an exclusively Japanese population. To our knowledge, no study has examined cross-
country tests for gender differences in guilt aversion and its cognitive underpinning.
Here, to address this issue, we investigated gender differences in guilt aversion and
the cognitive underpinnings by conducting online experiments on people living in Korea
and the United Kingdom (U.K.) using the same task as the Japanese study, which was
designed to study guilt aversion as well as inequity aversion. The two countries have
relatively the same economic status (according to the World Economic Outlook Database
[29], the 2020 per-capita GDP in the U.K. was US$44,153, while that of Korea was
US$44,750).
We also collected demographic information and Big Five scores. The Big Five
personality traits [30], widely known as a measure of individual personality, are based on
five dimensions: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and
conscientiousness. Agreeableness is characterized by the understanding of others’
emotions, intentions, and mental states; neuroticism is characterized by negative emotion
and includes various traits such as anxiety, anger, depression, and shame; and
conscientiousness is characterized by rule-based regulation and self-discipline. Women
consistently score higher than men on agreeableness and neuroticism across countries,
whereas gender differences in conscientiousness are not consistent across cultures, and
no significant gender difference has typically been found [31]. These findings suggest
that if gender differences do exist in guilt-aversion behavior, there may also be cultural
differences in the underlying cognitive strategies.
Results
We conducted an online behavioral study (Korea; n = 294 [175 women], U.K.; n = 347
was designed to dissociate the computational processes for guilt aversion and inequity
aversion. The participants were involved in two consecutive experiments (Fig. 1; see also
Materials and Methods). In the first experiment, all the participants performed the role of
Player A and completed one trial. Specifically, Player A had to choose between W or Z
and reveal his/her belief about the probability (0% to 100%) that Player B will choose R
(i.e., Cooperate). The participants knew that these choices would be used when Player B
was asked to make a choice in the second experiment.
In the second experiment, all the participants performed the role of Player B and
completed 45 trials. In each trial, with knowledge of Player A’s belief probability, Player
B had to decide whether to L (Defect) or R (Cooperate). Each participant completed 45
trials with a different partner (for Player A, the order of exposure was randomized across
subjects). To dissociate the computational processes for guilt aversion and inequity
aversion, their values were taken to be orthogonal (the correlation coefficient of the two
variables was -0.045; Pearson’s correlation test, P = 0.772). This task design allowed us
to investigate guilt aversion while removing the influence of inequity aversion.
Model selection. We conducted a statistical analysis of guilt aversion based on Player B’s
choices (see Materials and Methods). For inequity, Fehr and Schmidt’s model [26], which
splits inequity into advantages and disadvantages, is commonly used. However, as we
reported previously [15], the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) between these two
models showed that for 3,714 out of the 4,723 participants (78.6%) the absolute difference
for the inequity model was selected. Therefore, we also compared the BIC between Fehr
and Schmidt’s model [26] and the absolute difference model in the present study.
We found not only that the absolute difference model had a slightly smaller mean
BIC than Fehr and Schmidt’s model [26] for both the Korea and U.K. participants (Korea,
48.723 vs. 49.680; U.K., 50.520 vs. 51989), but also that for 224 out of the 294
participants (76.2%) in Korea and for 276 out of the 347 participants (79.5%) in the U.K.,
the smallest BIC model was the absolute difference model. Based on these findings, we
determined that the absolute difference model for inequity was plausible for the current
task.
Next, we performed a logistic regression comprised of Reward, Guilt, and
Inequity (i.e., absolute difference), and found that the 𝛽 values of Reward, Guilt and
U.K. participants, clarifying that these three components all have a critical effect on
behavior in this task.
Gender differences in guilt aversion.
To identify the relationship between guilt aversion (the 𝛽 value of Guilt, called
𝛽(𝐺𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑡) hereafter) and gender under the control of social-demographic environments
and basic personality traits, we first performed a Lasso regression (target variable:
𝛽(𝐺𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑡) ) based on the explanatory variables, including gender (men 1), Big Five
Inventory-10, age, education, and income for all participants.
Gender had relatively high weights for the Korea and the U.K. participants. We also
obtained the same result using a general linear model regression (Korea, P 0.0282; U.K.,
P 0.0045). These results are consistent with the Japanese study [15] and suggest that
guilt aversion is stronger in men than women in both the East and the West.
Underlying cognitive mechanisms for gender differences in guilt aversion.
Next, to identify the cognitive mechanisms for the gender difference, we conducted a
second Lasso regression, including interaction terms between the gender (dummy)
variable and the Big Five Inventory-10 and socioeconomic status scores. Fig. 2b and
Gender × Conscientiousness had a high positive weight for the U.K. population. We also
obtained the same result using a general linear model regression (U.K., P = 0.0484). This
finding shows that for the U.K., the stronger guilt aversion in men is attributable to greater
use of rule-based (social norm-based) strategies, again consistent with the Japanese study
[15]. On the contrary, only Gender × Neuroticism had a positive weight for the Korea
population. The correlation coefficient between Neuroticism and Conscientiousness for
Korea was quite small (correlation coefficient; -0.15; see also Supplementary Fig. S1,
which presents a correlation matrix for the Big Five variables). These findings indicate
that, although gender differences in guilt-based prosocial behavior are similarly observed
among these countries, the cognitive underpinnings may be heterogeneous depending on
the social systems, culture, etc.
Discussion
In this study, we conducted an online behavioral study (Korea, n = 294 [175 women];
U.K., n = 347 [190 women]) of a trust game that was designed to investigate guilt
aversion. We found that men exhibited stronger guilt aversion than women in both Korea
and the U.K. Additionally, our Lasso regression, including interaction terms between the
gender variable and the Big Five variables, revealed that conscientiousness and
neuroticism are key to men’s predominance in guilt-aversion in the U.K. and Korea,
respectively.
These results suggest that men’s predominance of guilt aversion may be universal
in different cultures but the underlying mechanisms for the gender difference may differ.
Guilt aversion includes an aspect of normative behavior elicited by experience (i.e., rule-
based decision making [28]). Our current results and our previous study [15] show that
men utilize rule-based strategies more in the U.K. and Japan. Simultaneously, guilt
aversion represents social pressure and may be related to sensitivity to negative emotions
[10]. The correlation between men’s predominance in guilt aversion and neuroticism in
the Korean population may echo this aspect, suggesting that men in Korea perceive guilt
aversion as a strong social pressure.
Related to cultural differences, previous research [31,32,33,34] found that more
gender-equal societies and economically developed countries are associated with larger
gender differences in personality traits (Big Five) and social preferences (altruism, trust,
reciprocity, risk-taking, and patience). One possible interpretation for this is that people
living in more progressive and equal countries have more opportunities to express cultural
and biological differences. This view is consistent with the fact that we see men’s
predominance of guilt aversion in developed countries (Korea, the U.K., and Japan).
Of course, there are alternative explanations for the different contributions of
conscientiousness and neuroticism to men’s guilt aversion in Korea and the U.K. We used
the Korean version of The Big Five Inventory-10 [35] translated from the original English
version [36], which was used in our U.K. experiment. Since this Korean version was
designed mainly for the elderly (65 years and older) and the reliability of the scale was
tested using elderly subjects (mean age: 73.4 years), the vocabulary familiar to this
demographic may be selected in the translation. Therefore, we cannot rule out the
possibility that this scale could not measure the Big Five personality traits of younger
generations precisely. Second, this short version of Big Five examines five factors with
only 10 questions (two questions per factor), which may have made it more difficult to
measure the five factors precisely than full versions. Further research is needed to validate
the cognitive mechanisms underlying cross-cultural and gender differences in guilt
aversion. Nevertheless, our findings about men’s predominance of guilt aversion in
Korea, the U.K. as well as Japan [15] provide an important clue that helps understand the
universality and heterogeneity of gender differences in prosocial behavior.
Materials and Methods
Participants.
We analyzed the data of 294 participants in Korea (175 women) and 347 participants in
followed the task instructions correctly. The participants were recruited from the
registrants of an Internet research service company (NTT Com Research, Inc.). The study
protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the National Institute of Information
and Communications Technology, and all participants gave informed consent.
Task.
In this task, adapted from a previous experimental study [11], two participants were paired
as Players A and B (see Fig. 1a). First, Player A was asked to choose between playing W
or Z and reveal his/her belief about 𝜏 (0%–100%), i.e., the probability that Player B
will choose R (i.e., Cooperate). In other words, 𝜏 represents Player A’s level of trust in
Player B. If Player A choose Z, then Players A and B receive payments 𝑧 and 𝑧 ,
𝐴 𝐵
respectively. If Player A chooses W, then (knowing Player A’s belief probability) Player
B is asked to choose between playing L (i.e., Defect) or R. If Player B chooses L, then
Player A receives 𝑦 and Player B receives 𝑦 , whereas if Player B chooses R, then the
𝐴 𝐵
two players receive 𝑥 and 𝑥 , respectively. For convenience, L and R in Fig. 1a are
𝐴 𝐵
denoted as Defect and Cooperate, respectively. Note that although the expressions L and
R represent the terms Defect and Cooperate, respectively, these terms were not used in
our experiment.
Fig. 1a presents two important conditions regarding the payments: if (1) 𝑦 < 𝑧 <
𝐴 𝐴
𝑥 , then player A signals trust (cooperation) to player B when player A chooses W; if (2)
𝑧 < 𝑥 < 𝑦 , then player B feels guilt upon disappointing player A relative to Player
𝐵 𝐵 𝐵
A’s belief in what Player A will receive. These two conditions are necessary for guilt
aversion theory. Additionally, if Player B is rational and selfish, then Player B chooses
Defect (L). Player A, anticipating this action, will choose Z and produce the allocation of
the money payoffs 𝑧 and 𝑧 . This online trust game was also used in our previous study
𝐴 𝐵
[15].
Procedure.
In the trust game, the participants were involved in two consecutive behavioral
measurements (Fig. 1b; see also the instructions in the Supplemental Information). Before
the first experiment, online participants read the rules of the trust game and the procedure.
In the first experiment, each participant played the trust game as Player A (i.e., choose W
or Z and reveal belief probability 𝜏 ) and experienced one trial. The participants knew
that these choices would be used when Player B was asked to make a choice in the second
experiment. Participants were instructed that player B was another participant who would
take part in the second experiment. However, player A was not informed of player B's
identity. The second experiment comprised 45 trials, with each participant involved in
performing Player B’s role (i.e., choose Defect or Cooperate) conditional on the matched
Player A choosing W and without knowing Player A’s actual choice. The participants
were also told that Player A will differ for each trial and that the pairings will be
anonymous. The sequence of the trials was randomized across participants, and no
feedback was provided to the participants during the experiment. Additionally, each
participant completed the personality trait tests (the Big Five Inventory-10 for Korea [35]
and for the U.K. [36]). Big Five Inventory-10 is a 10-item short version of the Big Five
Inventory-44 [37] and provides a measure of the Big Five for contexts in which a
participant’s time is severely limited.
For their participation, participants were paid in cashable points, proportional to the
number of payoffs earned during the experiment (equivalent to US$3–5). The participants
were also informed that the final payoff would be the sum of the decisions made as
Players A and B. For the second experiment, the participants were told that the earnings
for Player B would be the sum of the actual outcome of the 45 trials (instead of randomly
selecting only one trial).
Guilt aversion and inequity aversion.
We illustrate the guilt aversion model using the guilt sensitivity introduced by previous
theoretical and experimental studies [11,12]. Note that guilt sensitivity elicited in the trust
game by guilt aversion theory is fundamentally related to the Test of Self-Conscious
Affect-3 (TOSCA-3) and the Guilt and Shame Proneness Scale (GASP), which is a
common measure of guilt sensitivity in psychology but is unrelated to shame [38,39].
A guilt-averse player suffers from guilt to the extent he/she believes he/she hurts
others relative to what they believe they will get. Therefore, individuals are motivated by
their own beliefs. The guilt aversion model includes social pressure on Player B if the
profile (W, Defect) is played (see Fig. 1a). Let 𝜏 denote Player A's belief about the
probability (0% to 100%) that Player B will choose Cooperate. Player B is assumed to
believe that if Player A chooses W, then Player A believes that he/she will get a return of
𝜏 ∙ 𝑥 + (1 − 𝜏 ) ∙ 𝑦 , as the setting of Player A’s payoff is 𝑦 < 𝑧 < 𝑥 . The
𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴
difference, {𝜏 ∙ 𝑥 + (1 − 𝜏 ) ∙ 𝑦 } − 𝑦 = 𝜏 (𝑥 − 𝑦 ) , which is non-negative in our
𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴
settings, can measure how much Player B believes he/she hurts Player A relative to what
Player A believes he/she will get if Player B chooses Defect. In other words, the difference
𝜏 (𝑥 − 𝑦 ) is the amount of guilt that Player B experiences. Let us assume that
𝐴 𝐴 𝐴
parameter 𝛾 measures Player B’s sensitivity to guilt. A player is guilt-averse and will
Cooperate if 𝑦 − 𝛾 ∙ 𝜏 (𝑥 − 𝑦 ) < 𝑥 .
𝐵 𝐵 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝐵
By contrast, an individual is known to have the preference for fairness and resistance
to incidental inequalities [26]. Therefore, the inequity aversion model assumes that their
utility decreases when the allocation of monetary payoffs differs. Thus, if an inequity-
averse player suffers from inequity, he/she make decisions so as to minimize inequity in
outcomes. Notably, the advantageous inequity (receiving a larger reward than others) in
Fehr and Schmidt’s inequity aversion model is also referred to as “guilt.” However, this
outcome-based “guilt” and the intension-based “guilt” that we treat in guilt aversion are
completely different.
As mentioned in the Results section, using the BIC, we found that the absolute
difference for inequity was superior than the standard inequity aversion model [26]. Based
on this finding, we judged the absolute difference model for inequity to be a plausible one
for the current task. We also integrated guilt aversion and inequity aversion (absolute
inequity) into the utility function (𝑢 ) for Player B as follows:
𝑥 −𝛼 |𝑥 − 𝑥 | 𝑖𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑒 (𝑊, 𝐶𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒)
𝐵 𝐵 𝐴 𝐵
𝑢 = {
𝑦 − 𝛾 ∙ 𝜏 ∙ (𝑥 − 𝑦 ) − 𝛼 |𝑦 − 𝑦 | 𝑖𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑒 (𝑊, 𝐷𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡),
𝐵 𝐵 𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝐵 𝐴 𝐵
where 𝛼 is a constant measuring Player B’s sensitivity to inequity. A narrowly self-
interested agent is given the special case 𝛾 = 𝛼 = 0. In our game, the players choose
𝐵 𝐵
between binary actions that yield two different monetary payoff allocations: 𝑋 =
(𝑥 , 𝑥 ) and 𝑌 = (𝑦 , 𝑦 ) . The utilities of these allocations are given by the
𝐴 𝐵 𝐴 𝐵
aforementioned formula, yielding 𝑢 (𝑋) and 𝑢 (𝑌).

Logistic regression of the behavioral data.
Based on the logistic model of stochastic choice, we estimated three separate components
(i.e., monetary self-interest, guilt, and inequity) for each participant. The probability that
−{𝑢 (𝑋)−𝑢 (𝑌)}
Player B chooses Cooperate can be expressed as 𝑃 = 1⁄1 + 𝑒 .
𝐵 𝐵
𝐵,𝐶𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒
We then used logistic regression as follows:
𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡(𝑃 ) = 𝛽 + 𝛽 𝑅𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑 + 𝛽 𝐺𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑡 + 𝛽 𝐼𝑛𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦 ,
𝐵,𝐶𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 0 1 𝑡 2 𝑡 3 𝑡
where 𝑅𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑 is the reward size, calculated as 𝑥 − 𝑦 at time t, 𝐺𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑡 is the guilt
𝑡 𝐵 𝐵 𝑡
size calculated as −{0 − 𝜏 ∙ (𝑥 − 𝑦 )}, and 𝐼𝑛𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦 is the inequity size calculated
𝐴 𝐴 𝐴 𝑡
as −(|𝑥 − 𝑥 | − |𝑦 − 𝑦 |) . For convenience, 𝛽 , 𝛽 , and 𝛽 are denoted
𝐴 𝐵 𝐴 𝐵 1 2 3
as 𝛽(𝑅𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑) , 𝛽(𝐺𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑡) , and 𝛽(𝐼𝑛𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦) , respectively. To orthogonalize the three
explanatory variables, the actual 𝜏 used in the experiments was also set by the
experimenter. The correlation coefficients among the three explanatory variables were
less than 0.30 and nonsignificant (P > 0.05), and the values of guilt and inequity were
designed to be orthogonal (correlation coefficient of these two variables was −0.138 and
nonsignificant (P 0.367)) to dissociate the computational processes for guilt aversion
and inequity aversion. This task design allowed us to investigate guilt aversion without
the influence of inequity aversion. This logistic analysis was also used in our previous
study [15].
The logistic regression was done in R (R Development Core Team, 2008). We
used the brglm package to conduct our maximum likelihood estimation with the bias-
reduction method [40].
Lasso regression of the behavioral data.
Having confirmed that these three factors play crucial roles in the current task using
logistic regression, we conducted a Lasso regression [41] to identify the relationship
between 𝛽(𝐺𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑡) and gender under controlled social-demographic environments (age,
education, and income) and basic personality traits (Big Five Inventory). Moreover, to
investigate the cognitive processes potentially underlying gender differences in guilt
aversion, we conducted a second Lasso regression that included the interactions of gender
with personality trait scores.
Specifically, to identify the relationship between guilt aversion (𝛽(𝐺𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑡) ) and
gender, we first performed a Lasso model analysis (target variable: 𝛽(𝐺𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑡)) based on
the explanatory variables, including gender (men 1) and the Big Five Inventory-10 and
socioeconomic status scores (age, education, and income) for all participants (see also
specific to gender, we performed a second Lasso model regression (target variable:
𝛽(𝐺𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑡) ), including interaction terms between the gender variable and the Big Five
S2(2)).
Lasso regression [41] is a variable-selection-and-constraint method that is best used
for a large number of predictors, especially when they are highly correlated. The LASSO
algorithm constrains or penalizes the absolute size of the regression coefficients so that
no coefficients are too large when compared with others. The Lasso procedure not only
achieves beneficial shrinkage, but it also ensures that a variable remains in the model with
a non-zero coefficient if its incremental predictive value is sufficient for justifying the
sacrifice of a degree of freedom. Based on the benefits of Lasso regression, we adapted
this method for our behavioral data. Lasso was done in R (cv.glmnet and glmnet included
in the glmnet package [42]).
