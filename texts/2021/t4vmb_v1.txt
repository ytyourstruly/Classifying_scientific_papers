Satisficing and Sample Size in Instance-Based Learning Theory 2
Abstract
Sequential decisions from sampling are common in daily life: we often explore
alternatives sequentially, decide when to stop such exploration process, and use the experience
acquired during sampling to make a choice for what is expected to be the best option. In
decisions from experience, theories of sampling and experiential choice are unable to explain the
decision of when to stop the sequential exploration of alternatives. In this chapter, we propose a
mechanism to inductively generate stopping decisions, and we demonstrate its plausibility in a
large and diverse human data set of the binary choice sampling paradigm. Our proposed
stopping mechanism relies on the choice process of a theory of experiential choice, Instance-
Based Learning Theory (IBLT). The new stopping mechanism tracks the relative prediction
errors of the two options during sampling, and stops when such difference is close to zero. Our
results from simulation are able to accurately predict human stopping decisions distributions in
the dataset. This model provides an integrated theoretical account of decisions from experience,
where the stopping decisions are generated inductively from the sampling process.
Introduction
Decisions that we make in many naturalistic situations involve a sequential process of
sampling the available options before making a real choice (Hertwig et al., 2004; Gonzalez &
Dutt, 2016). For example, in selecting candidates for a job, we might evaluate the applicants
sequentially, keeping in mind those most promising candidates, and deciding to stop the
evaluation of candidates once we have enough evidence that our top candidate should be hired.
Another example may involve the selection of a house for rent. The options available in the
market may be visited sequentially, and we decide when to stop considering new options when
we have a house that is good enough. Another example may be that of selecting a suit to
Satisficing and Sample Size in Instance-Based Learning Theory 3
purchase for a special event; multiple suits may be tried on in the fitting room, and we decide
when to stop trying out suits when we have at least one that is appropriate for the event. In all
these situations we evaluate each of the alternatives sequentially, decide when to stop the
sampling process based on the information accumulated, and use the experience acquired during
sampling to make a definite choice for what we think is the current best option.
The type of situation in which we explore potential alternatives before we make a choice
has been studied in an abstract paradigm of experience-based choice between risky monetary
gambles, referred to as the “Sampling Paradigm” in Decisions from Experience (DfE) research
(Hertwig & Erev, 2009; Hertwig et al., 2004). In the sampling paradigm, individuals decide how
many outcomes to observe from a set of options of uncertain value before making a choice.
Participants make one selection among the options available each time, and they observe the
outcome which is drawn from an underlying payoff distribution in the option selected. When the
person decides to stop the sampling process, a decision is made for one of the options, based on
their experienced values during sampling.
A robust phenomenon that emerged from DfE research, with important theoretical
implications, is the Description-Experience Gap (DE Gap). The DE Gap suggests that decisions
made on the basis of experience contrast directly with decisions made based on pure description
of the alternatives (Hertwig et al., 2004; Gonzalez & Dutt, 2011; Wulff, et al., 2018). A common
explanation of the DE Gap is a “sampling error”: when people rely on experience they tend to
rely on a small number of samples (i.e., sample size), which will result in observed distributions
of outcomes that are distorted and not reflective of the true distributions (Hertwig & Pleskac,
2010; Hertwig et al., 2004; Hau, Pleskac, Kiefer & Hertwig, 2008). A major question in DfE
Satisficing and Sample Size in Instance-Based Learning Theory 4
research is therefore, how do people decide the number of samples to observe (i.e., when to stop
sampling?).
A large amount of research has investigated choice in the sampling paradigm. For
example, to address the question of how do people decide their sampling size, researchers have
looked at moderators of the sampling size including: the structure of the problems and the
variability of the options (e.g., a choice between two risky alternatives or between a risky and a
safe option) (Wulff, et al., 2018; Gonzalez & Mehlhorn, 2016), the time available and
motivations to sample more or less (Hau et al. 2008), and the domain of the problem (e.g.,
whether gains, losses or a mix of outcomes are involved) (Lejarraga, Hertwig & Gonzalez, 2012;
Gonzalez & Mehlhorn, 2016). However, as concluded in a recent meta-analysis by Wulff et al.,
(2018), theories of sampling and experiential choice are not capable of explaining the sequential
sampling process and the final choice, while at the same time also explaining the decision of
when to stop sampling. Our goal in this chapter is to offer a theoretical foundation to integrate
the decision of the sampling size into a well-known general theory of the cognitive processes in
experiential choice, Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT, Gonzalez, Lerch, & Lebiere, 2003;
Gonzalez & Dutt, 2011).
Models of DfE in the Sampling Paradigm
In early DfE research of the sampling paradigm (Hertwig et al., 2004), researchers aimed
at discovering the effect of experience acquired during sampling on the subsequent consequential
choice. Thus, most models of DfE in the sampling paradigm focused on capturing the decision
after sampling but not the choices during the sampling process itself. Furthermore, existent
models of sampling vary greatly in the assumptions they make about the sampling process. A
modeling competition held in 2009 by Erev and colleagues (Erev et al., 2010) illustrates these
Satisficing and Sample Size in Instance-Based Learning Theory 5
issues. The competition was designed to compare and select the best models of DfE (sampling
paradigm and other paradigms as well). Contestant teams submitted computational models after
fitting them to an “estimation” data set provided by the organizers. The models were compared
based on how well they predicted a “competition” data set to which modelers did not have access
to. The models submitted to the sampling paradigm illustrate the kind of broad and disparate
assumptions these models make about the sampling process, including some models that assume
a random selection of options during sampling (Erev et al., 2010). For example, the baseline
model provided by the organizers, assumes a random sample of k draws (a parameter fit to data)
from each of the available options and the accumulation of outcomes based on the random
sample of each option (Erev et al., 2010). None of the models submitted to the modeling
competition present an integrated view of how the selection process is done during sampling and
final choice, or the prediction of the sampling size distribution.
After the competition, Gonzalez and Dutt (2011) analyzed the models and presented an
alternative model comparison, providing a summary of the highest ranking models that address
the sampling paradigm in the Erev et al. (2010) competition. None of those models is able to
predict the sampling process and sampling size decisions together. Gonzalez and Dutt (2011)
provide a general model of DfE based on IBLT; a model that is be able to capture the process of
human experiential choice, not only in the sampling paradigm but in other paradigms as well
(Hertwig & Erev, 2009). Using a quantitative model comparison, Gonzalez and Dutt (2011)
demonstrated that the IBL model generalized well across experimental paradigms. Importantly,
the IBL model was the only model able to predict the sequence of sampling selections that
humans make during sampling as well as the final consequential choice after sampling. This was
achieved using the same common cognitive mechanisms of IBLT, an achievement unique to this
Satisficing and Sample Size in Instance-Based Learning Theory 6
model. The generality of the IBL model of choice was further demonstrated in static and
dynamic tasks (Lejarraga, Dutt & Gonzalez, 2012), in tasks involving experience and
descriptions (Lejarraga & Gonzalez, 2011), in tasks involving teams (Lejarraga et al., 2014), and
in two-choice social dilemmas (Gonzalez et al., 2015). This model is now considered as the most
versatile and comprehensive model of DfE (Hertwig, 2015).
Despite the successful demonstrations of the generality of the IBL model, there is one
question left unanswered in Gonzalez and Dutt (2011): how is the stopping decision made?.
Gonzalez and Dutt (2011) used a binomial distribution of sample sizes to determine the sample
size in each simulation ran with the IBL model. This distribution has shown to accurately
represent the sample size distribution in humans (e.g., Wulff et al., 2018). In other words, the
IBL model itself did not make a stopping decision, but it made the choices of which option
during the sequential sampling process and the final choice based on the IBL mechanisms.
The particular question of how the decision of the sample size is made during the
sampling process is largely unanswered. In well-known accumulation models, the sampling
length depends on the relative evidence strength of the choice options (e.g., Busemeyer and
Townsend, 1993). These models however, often rely on perceptual decision tasks and duration is
measured in continuous time. In the sampling paradigm of DfE, the sampling size is discrete and
it is unclear how the continuous duration would translate to the discrete number of samples. In
the literature, there are a couple of papers that have aimed at proposing mechanisms for making
stopping decisions in the sampling paradigm of DfE. First, Markant, et al., (2015) present a
sequential sampling model that tries to explain the individual variations in the sample size. The
model relies on Cumulative Prospect Theory (Tversky & Khaneman, 1992) to determine the
value of options. But it also adds a number of assumptions regarding transition probabilities
Satisficing and Sample Size in Instance-Based Learning Theory 7
during sampling, and the trajectory that a preference or relative value of the two options in a
binary choice task (i.e., drift rate) (Markant et al., 2015). The number of samples drawn depend
on the drift rate and on a threshold level of preference. Sampling stops when the threshold is
reached. The model reported high accuracy in the choice proportions, and the distributions of
sample size appear to be similar to those of human data. However, there was no quantification of
the accuracy of the model in accounting for the sample size, together with the choices during and
after sampling. Generally, the model is quite complicated and likely not cognitively plausible.
Second, Srivastava, Muller-Trede, Schrater, and Vul (2016) followed on the work of
Markant et al. (2015) with a simpler model that relies on the difference of the expected values of
the two options and on “volatility,” representing the trend of the prediction error. An interesting
insight from this paper is that the prediction error should decrease over samples and help
determine when to stop sampling. Volatility is a cognitively plausible concept suggesting that as
long as this prediction error increases and changes, humans might infer that more samples are
required, and that stopping makes sense once the volatility converges to a low value. Srivastava
et al. (2016) tested individual volatility in a simple additive model explaining about 20-30% of
the variance in human sampling sizes. The best fit correlation of sampling durations predicted by
this model and human data is R=0.03. They improved this model but unfortunately introduced
some unrealistic assumptions regarding what the observer in the task knows (e.g., average
difference of the options’ expected values and cumulative volatility across the sequence).
Inspired by these efforts, we propose a mechanism to inductively generate the stopping
decision using the IBL model of choice. We test such mechanism by comparing data generated
through IBL simulations to human data in the largest and most diverse data set of the sampling
paradigm known today (Wulff et al., 2018).

IBLT and the IBL Model of Choice.
In making decisions from experience, we evaluate available alternatives sequentially, by
comparing each alternative to choices we have made in the past, and act according to the best
outcomes we have experienced. This idea was proposed and formalized in IBLT, a theory of how
humans make decisions from experience in dynamic environments (Gonzalez, Lerch, & Lebiere,
2003).
In IBLT’s process, alternatives are evaluated sequentially by sampling the environment,
comparing each available alternative to past choices from experience. Based on the similarity of
the alternative’s attributes, alternatives are evaluated by aggregating experienced outcomes, to
determine their expected value. Ultimately, an option with the best expected value is selected and
executed. After each sampling selection is made, a stopping decision is considered regarding
whether to continue to sample information or to stop and make a choice for the current best
option. Such process in IBLT is similar to the “satisficing” strategy that has been contrasted to
“optimizing” strategies in decision making research (Simon, 1957; March & Simon, 1958). In
IBLT, stopping decisions are often determined by the time remaining to make a choice, which is
dictated by the dynamics of the environment (Gonzalez, et al., 2003). Here we propose a way to
formalize such satisficing mechanism in an IBL model of choice in which the sampling process
happens over discrete samples rather than continuous time.
The mathematical formalizations used in the IBL model of choice have been published in
multiple places (e.g., Lejarraga et al., 2012, Gonzalez & Dutt, 2011, Gonzalez, 2013). However,
for completeness, we present these general mechanisms here before introducing the satisficing
mechanism, which is the novel contribution in this chapter.

IBL model of Choice
An “instance” in IBLT is a memory unit that represents the potential alternatives
evaluated. Instances are memory representations consisting of three elements: a situation (a set of
attributes that give a context to the decision, or state S); a decision (the action taken
corresponding to an alternative in state S, or action A); and a utility (expected utility or
experienced outcome x of the action taken in a state). An option k=(S,A) is defined by taking
action A in state S. In the binary choice task, there are two options (i.e., k=2), the instances do not
have a context (attributes) (S); thus they only consist of the action (A) and the outcome (x). For
example, in the binary choice between: Option A: a .8 chance to get $4 and .2 chance to get $0,
and Option B: get $3 for sure; the instances are: (A, 4), (A, 0), and (B, 3).
At time t, assume that there are n different generated instances k,x for i = 1,...,n ,
k,t i,k,t k,t
corresponding to selecting k and achieving outcome x . Each instance i in memory has an
i,k,t
“activation” value, defined in the ACT-R cognitive architecture, and which represents how
readily available that information is in memory (Anderson et al., 2004). The activation of an
instance is determined by similarity to past situations, recency, frequency, and noise. In the IBL
model of choice, we consider a simplified version of the activation equation which only captures
how recently and frequently instances are activated:
where d and  are the decay and noise parameters, respectively, and T {0,...,t-1} is
i,k,t
the set of the previous timestamps in which the instance i was observed. The rightmost term
represents the Gaussian noise for capturing individual variation in activation, and  is a
i,k,t
Satisficing and Sample Size in Instance-Based Learning Theory 10
random number drawn from a uniform distribution U(0, 1) at each time step and for each
instance and option.
Activation of an instance i is used to determine the probability of retrieval of an instance
from memory. The probability of an instance i is a function of its activation Act relative to the
i,k,t
activation of all instances:
where  is the Boltzmann constant (i.e., the “temperature”) in the Boltzmann distribution.
For simplicity,  is often defined as a function of the same  used in the activation equation
The expected utility of option k is calculated based on a mechanism called Blending,
using the past experienced outcomes stored in each instance. In the IBL model of choice employs
the Blending calculation as defined for choice tasks (Lejarraga et al., 2012; Gonzalez & Dutt,
2011) :
Essentially, the Blending operation is the sum of all past experienced outcomes weighted
by their probability of retrieval. Where x is the outcome stored in an instance i associated with

ikt k,t
1 A more generalized formulation of the Blending equation can be found in Lebiere (1999).
Satisficing and Sample Size in Instance-Based Learning Theory 11
the number of instances stored in memory for option k up to the last trial. The choice rule is to
select the option that corresponds to the maximum blended value.
To begin the task, instances are initialized with an outcome value that is higher than those
experienced in the task, which represents expectations and helps in initiating exploration of the
options (Lejarraga et al., 2012). In the simulations presented in this chapter we do not fit the
model’s parameters in any way. We use parameters that are considered “default” in the ACT-R
community: where d= 0.5 and = 0.25. Thus, the model data reported here, is generated from the
IBL model simulations, which are pure predictions from the IBL model.
A Satisficing Mechanism in the IBL Model of Choice.
Similar to the idea of Srivastava et al., (2016), we propose that humans are able to
determine the error in their predictions by observing the outcome from the option selected
through immediate feedback. This error is then used to track the relative prediction errors of the
two options during sampling. Intuitively, it is expected that the relative value of the prediction
errors will decrease with learning, as the estimations through Blending converge. But clearly, the
way such decline occurs will depend largely on the structure and variability of the environment.
This proposed process in the IBL model is formalized as follows:
First, for each option k, we calculate the prediction error: the difference between the
expected value (Blended value) of the option, V , and the actual outcome obtained x at time t,
kt kt
we call this value the “Gap” :
𝐺𝑎𝑝 = |𝑉 − 𝑥 | (4)
(cid:3038)(cid:3047) (cid:3038)(cid:3047) (cid:3038)(cid:3047)
2 A similar “Gap” concept was used in Gonzalez, et al., 2015 for IBL models of the Prisoner’s Dilemma,
where the actions of each player were determined by a dynamic expectation of the actions of the other player.
Satisficing and Sample Size in Instance-Based Learning Theory 12
Second, we calculate the relative prediction errors for the two options, k=1 and k=2, form
time t-1 to time t, we call this value the Gap and is defined as follows:
Gap = ||Gap – Gap | - |Gap –Gap || (5)
t 1t 1(t-1) 2t 2(t-1)
The Gap is expected to decrease over time, and the prediction is that sampling will stop
at trial t, when the marginal value Gap is close to zero. But, as it will become clear later, the
Wulff al (2018) data set contains a very diverse set of problems with very different values and
the decline of the Gap can vary largely from problem to problem. To account for the large
variability of problems in the data set with a single model, we made the stopping point during
sampling a probabilistic process. We defined an increasing concave probability function (from
0.5 to 1) that will determine whether to actually stop every time the Gap reaches a threshold
value close to zero (we defined such a threshold value of 0.10). This probability (starting at 0.5)
increases by a negative logarithm function (-log p, where p is previous probability) each time t in
Gap reaches the threshold, such that the sampling stops (with probability 1) after the threshold
th
has been reached for the 7 time.
Data Set and Simulation Methods
Wulff et al. (2018) obtained data sets from original authors of papers containing one or
more experiments with the sampling paradigm. The data set details are reported in Wulff et al.,
(2018, Appendix A) and it was used to conduct a meta-analysis. The dataset is composed of 80
different papers with a total of 4,400 participants and 45,239 decisions from experience (we did
not use the data of decision from description). Out of the 80 papers, 55 of them had experiments
with autonomous sampling, where a stopping decision was made (participants decided how long
to sample the two options). These data sets are the only ones relevant for testing the proposed
satisficing mechanism in the IBL model.
Satisficing and Sample Size in Instance-Based Learning Theory 13
Thus, the full dataset used in the current study consisted of 40,246 participants; 1,219
unique different problems; 1,906 paper-problem pairs; and a total of 1,065,918 decisions from
experience including the sampling decisions and the final choice. The number of outcomes in
each of the two options vary across problems between 1 and 5; the features of the problems also
vary, such as whether the two options are risky, or one option is risky and the other one is safe;
or whether the problems involve gains, losses and mixed types of outcomes.
We observed that some experiments had less than 10 participants, giving very little and
noisy data for analyses. Thus, we removed 865 such paper-problem pairs. The resulting data set
consists of 39,111 participants, 610 unique different problems, 1,041 paper-problem pairs, and a
total of 842,242 decisions from experience including sampling and final choice. When analyzing
the number of samples in this dataset we found that the number of samples vary from 1 to 750.
We visualized the data using boxplots and observed outliers. Using the Inter Quartile Range
(IQR) rule, we detected those observations above Q +−1.5 * IQR or below Q -−1.5 * IQR and
1 1
removed those outliers from the data.
After the outlier removal, the final dataset used for analyses consists of 37,106
participants, 610 unique different problems, 1,041 paper-problem pairs, and a total of 842,242
decisions from experience including sampling and final choice. In this data set the sample sizes
range from 1 and 71 samples.
IBL model’s simulation methods.
We ran equal number of simulated IBL agents i.e., 39,111 on the 610 problems observed
in the human data before removing the outliers. It is important to remember that we used the
default decay (d= 0.5) and noise (= 0.25) parameters in the model, that is, we did not use the
Satisficing and Sample Size in Instance-Based Learning Theory 14
human data to inform the model and did not fit the parameters of the model to the human data. In
other words, the simulation results are pure predictions from the IBL theory.
The IBL model makes a decision of which of the two options to sample in each trial,
according to the Blended value (Equation 3). After each sample, the model makes the decision of
whether to stop sampling based on the calculation of the marginal value of the two options
(Gap ) and threshold (Equation 5). When the model reaches the threshold for the first time, it
has a 0.5 probability of stopping, and this probability increases every time the threshold is
reached. If the model decides to stop sampling, it then makes the final choice after sampling,
according to the Blended value of the two options accumulated during sampling (Equation 3).
The Gap (Equation 5) lets the IBL agents to keep sampling after the threshold has
reached up to 7 times (i.e., until the probability of stopping is 1), or when the maximum number
of samples are reached. We used 750 as the maximum number of samples allowed in the model
and a threshold of 0.10, an arbitrary value close to zero. After running the simulations, we
performed an outlier analysis on the simulation data, using the similar criteria as that used in
human data. We used 71 samples as cutoff in IBL model, i.e., we removed those agent data
whose sample size was greater than 71. The IBL dataset resulting from this process has 33,509
agents, 610 unique different problems, 1,041 paper-problem pairs, and a total of 715,732
decisions from experience including sampling and final choice.
Results
We concentrate our analyses on the stopping decisions reflected in the sample size, for
the 1,041 paper-problem pairs in the empirical data set and in the model dataset. The sample size
is the total number of selections made by participants (or by agents in the model) during
sampling and up to the stopping point, before making a choice.

distribution represents the human sample-size distribution (Geometric (p = .042) with χ (7) =
2877, p < .001). This geometric distribution is heavily right-tailed, the mean sample size is 22.7
(SD = 16.01), and the median sample size is 20 samples. Similarly, a geometric distribution also
represents the IBL model’s sample-size distribution accurately (Geometric (p = .045) with χ (7)
= 9626, p < .001). The model’s distribution’s mean sample size is 21.36 (SD = 13.62), and the
median is 19 samples. The chi-square test signifies that human distribution and model sample

more in Risky-Risky problems (median = 21, mean = 24.87, SD = 16.03) compared to Risky-
Safe problems (median = 13, mean = 17.11, SD = 14.38). The IBL agents also sampled more in
Risky-Risky problems (median = 21, mean = 23.57, SD = 15.21) compared to Risky-Safe
problems (median = 17, mean = 16.71, SD = 8.91). The median sample size in the model is
slightly higher than the human data in the Risky-Safe problems, but generally, the predictions of
the model are very accurate. The chi-square tests signify that human sample distribution and
model sample distribution are strongly associated in Risky-Safe problems (χ (7) = 8352, p <
.001) as well as the Risky-Risky problems (χ (7) = 733.2, p < .001).

agents are very similar in gain problems (Human: median = 20, mean = 23.51, SD = 16.45; IBL

Analysis of Sample Size per Paper-Problem Pair.
To investigate the model predictions and the human data in more detail, we analyzed the
relationships between the sample size in human data and in the IBL agents for each of the 1,041
paper-problem pairs.
Safe problems (Panel B), and for Gains, Losses, and Mixed problems (Panel C). The overall
sample size per paper-problem pair predicted by the IBL model is positively correlated to the
sample size observed in the human data (R = 0.26). This is a very high correlation considering
that the IBL model was not fit in any way to the human data and considering the large variety of
problems in the human data. As shown by the diagonal red line, the IBL model under-samples
compared to humans (i.e., the majority of the observations are below the red line). The IBL
model is positively correlated to the sample size observed in the human data for Risky-Risky
problems (R = 0.023) and negatively correlated for Risky-Safe problems (R = -0.21); and
positively correlated to all three domains including gains, losses and mixed. In general, humans
sampled significantly more in the Risky-Safe type of problems than what the IBL model
predicts.

Delta Gap Over Sample Count.
Here we illustrate the Gap over the sampling process. Again, the expectation is that the
Gap will decrease over samples. The intuition is that as more samples are accumulated, the
predicted outcomes of each of the two options (by Blended values in Equation 3) will be close to
the actual outcome observed in each option. That is, the predicted error, Gap , will decrease
over time. However, the Gap might not always decrease monotonically, as it would depend on
the statistical structure of the gambles.
To have a frame of gross reference for the Gap in the human data, we calculated an
experienced value of each of the two options ExV using the frequencies of each outcome the
humans observed. In past research, this has been shown to be an approximation to the Blended
value of the IBL model in choice tasks (Gonzalez & Mehlhorn, 2016). ExV for each option k is
defined as follows:

Using the ExV, we calculate the Gap (Equation 4) and marginal value Gap (Equation 5)
using human data.
Given the large differences across problems in terms of the outcome values, to average
the Gap over the sample count, we normalized the values by the following function:
(cid:3008)(cid:3028)(cid:3043) (cid:2879)(cid:2923)(cid:2919)(cid:2924)((cid:3008)(cid:3028)(cid:3043))

decreases rapidly in the first samples. The initial large values of Gap in the model are due to
our assumptions of pre-populated values in the instances: Basically, for the IBL model, every
experienced outcome will be maximally different from expectations in the initial trials, given
general assumptions made in the model about initial expectation values (Lejarraga et al., 2012).

Proportion of Maximization During Sampling and Choice.
To illustrate that in addition to capture the sample size, the IBL model is capable of
capturing the decisions during sampling and the consequential choice, we calculated the
proportion of maximization (PMax) during sampling and final choice. The PMax represents the
presents the PMax during sampling and during the final choice in the human dataset and the IBL
model data set for all the problems, and using the same groupings as in the sections above. The
RMSE are all very low (ranging from 0.02 to 0.06), suggesting that the model is generally able to
capture the PMax during sampling and choice. This result replicates the well-known capability of
IBL models to capture choices during sampling and after sampling (e.g., Gonzalez & Dutt, 2011;
Lejarraga et al., 2012).

Discussion
Understanding how people decide the length of their exploration process (i.e., how to
make a stopping decision) before making a choice, is critical for theories of decisions from
experience. The sampling paradigm in DfE is a simple but useful way to study this important
question. Research on the sampling paradigm has addressed related questions, for example: how
the choice is influenced by the information collected during sampling, and what are the
moderators for the sampling phase that influence the decision of the number of samples to take.
These moderators include: the variability of the problems (e.g., whether the choice is being made
between two risky alternatives or a risky and a safe alternative) (Wulff et al., 2018; Gonzalez &
Mehlhorn, 2016); the motivations and costs during sampling (Hau et al 2008); the loss or gain
domain of the problems (Lejarraga et al., 2012; Gonzalez & Mehlhorn, 2016); and others.
But the question of how people decide when to stop sampling, and what are the cognitive
mechanisms involved in such decision, has received very little attention. Theories that are able to
integrate the whole process of decisions from experience, from the sequential decisions from
sampling, the decision of when stop sampling, and the subsequent choice into an integrated
model do not exist. The IBL model of binary choice is the only current available option able to
achieve such integrated theoretical account of DfE. IBL has already been considered an
important integrated cognitive account of DfE (Hertwig, 2015; Wulff et al., 2018), as it has
demonstrated generalized predictions on various DfE paradigms, accounting for individual
choices during sampling and final choice (Gonzalez & Dutt, 2011; Lejarraga et al., 2012;
Gonzalez & Mehlhorn, 2016; Dutt & Gonzalez, 2015). The current paper advances this model by
Satisficing and Sample Size in Instance-Based Learning Theory 25
proposing a satisficing mechanism to account for the decision of when to stop sampling, while
using the same IBL choice mechanisms.
The satisficing process proposed here differs from other attempts to model stopping
decisions in the sampling paradigm (Markant et al., 2015; Srivastava et al., 2016). Mainly, our
proposed prediction error mechanism for stopping decisions, Gap , relies directly on Blending,
the belief value of each of the options that is already part of IBLT (Gonzalez et al., 2003). This
occurs by tracking the differences of the prediction error between options over the samples. This
concept is similar to that of “volatility” discussed in Srivastava et al., (2016), but instead of using
completely new formulations of the concept of prediction error, we use the same Blending
mechanism in IBLT that is used to make a choice.
Importantly, our model is able to capture stopping decisions of individuals in the largest
data set known of the sampling paradigm (Wulff et al 2018). In contrast to past research
(Markant et al., 2015; and Srivastava et al., 2016), we did not fit the model to human data. We
also did not make any unreasonable assumptions regarding information that participants did not
have in the studies. That is, our model’s results are pure predictions from the theoretical
assumptions of IBL, a cognitive plausible model of DfE. Considering this, our results are an
excellent account of the human decisions. The IBL model is able to capture the sample size
distributions from humans and to predict the sampling sequence lengths for individuals with
significantly more accuracy than past models. Our model’s prediction of individual sampling
size is R = 0.26 (compared to R = 0.03 in Srivastava et al., 2016). In addition, our model is able
to capture individual choice per sample, and choice from experience, after sampling. Thus, our
model provides an integrated theoretical account of DfE in the sampling process. The general
integration of sampling processes with stopping decisions and choice has already been discussed
Satisficing and Sample Size in Instance-Based Learning Theory 26
as part of IBLT (Gonzalez et al., 2003). However, in this general theory, stopping decisions are
determined by externally set deadlines and time constraints. In the sampling paradigm people are
not provided with deadlines, sequence length information, or time constraints to make a stopping
decision. Thus, we propose an endogenously-generated stopping mechanism that applies in each
sample taken in the task; the mechanism is based on the relative prediction error of the
alternatives using the IBLT’s choice rule, Blending.
The work presented in this chapter is only the beginning of what we expect to be an
interesting integration with other models of sequential learning and decisions from sampling.
First, some of our current assumptions will need to be investigated further. For example, in this
work we assumed a “close to zero” threshold to compare to the Gap . But, it is very possible
that this threshold is problem-dependent and individual-dependent. We also assumed a
probabilistic non-linear increasing function for stopping every time the threshold is reached.
These two assumptions will require more investigation to determine an individualized generation
of such thresholds according to the individual experiences. Generally, the results presented here
did not rely on human data; and in particular the specific sequences observed by the human
participants. We suspect that feeding the IBL model with the same sequence of experiences from
each individual would make our model significantly more accurate in the prediction of the
sampling size. These and other questions are left for future research.
Second, in many models of sequential decision making, the concept of a “Threshold” is
used to determine the decision of when to stop sequential choice (Baunmann et al., 2020; Guan
et al., 2020). Often, in this research the question is about the deviations of human thresholds and
optimal thresholds. These models often rely on pre-determined sequences from defined
distributions and specific lengths. In these experiments, participants commonly know the length
Satisficing and Sample Size in Instance-Based Learning Theory 27
of the sequence (Baunmann et al., 2021; Guan et al., 2020). This information significantly
changes the nature of the problem compared to the sampling paradigm, where participants are
free to sample for as long as they want without any total sample limit or information. Thus, the
generality of our proposed mechanism to such sequential choice tasks will need to be
investigated.
