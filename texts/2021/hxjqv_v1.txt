The repulsion effect occurs when the presence of an inferior option (the decoy) decreases the attractiveness
of the option that dominates it (the target), in puzzling contrast to the attraction effect. In this paper, we
formally develop and experimentally test a normative account of the repulsion effect. Our theory is based on
the idea that the true values of options are uncertain and must be inferred from available information, which
includes the properties of other options. A low-value decoy can signal that the target also has low value when
both are believed to be generated by a similar process. We formalize this logic using a hierarchical Bayesian
cognitive model that makes predictions about how the strength of the repulsion effect should vary with sta-
tistical properties of the decision problem. This theory can help account for several documented phenomena
linked to the repulsion effect, as well as results from new lab experiments. Our results illuminate key drivers
of context dependence across both economic and perceptual judgment and sharpen our understanding of
when decoys can be detrimental.

1. Introduction
The strategic design of choice sets and product lines is a critical component of marketing.
While the design process frequently assumes that preferences between options are not
influenced by the set of alternatives, much work has demonstrated that this context does
affect preference. For example, adding a clearly inferior item (the “decoy”) to the choice
set can make the option which dominates it (the “target”) more appealing, a phenomenon
known as the attraction effect (Huber et al. 1982). Such context effects have fundamentally
shaped research, teaching, and practice in consumer behavior for decades. They have also
helped to identify the empirical boundaries of rational choice theory (Huber et al. 2014) and
motivated a multidisciplinary search for deeper principles of context-sensitive judgment
across marketing, psychology, economics, neuroscience, and biology (e.g., Simonson 1989,
Tversky and Simonson 1993, Roe et al. 2001, Hedgcock and Rao 2009, Bordalo et al. 2013,
Trueblood et al. 2013, Lea and Ryan 2015, Li et al. 2018, Bhui et al. 2021, Spektor et al.
2021). Nevertheless, the robustness of the attraction effect has been seriously questioned
by recent work, suggesting it may be less common than popularly thought.
Most strikingly, the opposite pattern has been observed, in which the inferior decoy
makes the dominating target seem worse—a repulsion effect (Frederick et al. 2014). The
repulsion effect has been documented in preferential choices between consumer goods (Fred-
erick et al. 2014, Liao et al. 2020), reinforcement learning paradigms with abstract options
(Ert and Lejarraga 2018, Spektor et al. 2019), perceptual decisions like picking the largest
rectangle (Spektor et al. 2018), and even hybrid tasks with preferential decisions presented
using perceptual stimuli (Spektor et al. 2022, Brendl et al. 2023). The existence of this phe-
nomenon means that a brand which introduces an inferior decoy option could damage sales
of a target product, in contrast to previous marketing research and popular writing which
traditionally emphasizes the attraction effect (Ariely 2008, Orhun 2009). However, the con-
ditions under which this adverse outcome might occur remain to be identified, making it
difficult for managers to know when decoys may backfire, and leading to controversy over
the effect. The anomalous yet wide-ranging observation of the repulsion effect indicates the
need to investigate an alternate source of context dependence. Modeling attempts have
been confined to mechanical approaches that trace out the process of deliberation, with
limited success (Spektor et al. 2021, 2022).
Why does the repulsion effect occur? Some informally propose that inferior decoys may
“contaminate” other options with similar attributes. This idea is referred to as the tainting
hypothesis (Frederick et al. 2014, Simonson 2014). Yet, despite its intuitive appeal, it is
not clear why exactly such a mechanism should exist or what factors should modulate its
strength.
In this paper, we formally develop and experimentally test a normative account of the
repulsion effect which can be viewed as a Bayesian formulation of the tainting hypothesis.
Frederick et al. (2014) found a broad lack of evidence for the effect in 38 studies, including replications of several
influential paradigms. Yang and Lynn (2014) similarly found little reliable evidence of the effect across 91 attempts
to produce it. Trendl et al. (2021) found a precisely estimated null effect in an experiment designed to meet the ideal
test conditions laid out by Huber et al. (2014).
As pointed out by Spektor et al. (2019), the repulsion effect should not be conflated with the similarity effect
(Tversky 1972) even though both describe a relative decrease in preference for the target option similar to the decoy.
The key difference between the two is that the decoy is plainly inferior to the target in the repulsion effect but
of comparable value in the similarity effect. Like Spektor et al. (2019), in our experiments we see no support for
a similarity-effect interpretation as participants prefer the decoy substantially less than the target, and are thus
evidently able to distinguish the two.
Our theory is based on the idea that the true values of options are uncertain and must
be inferred from available information, which includes the properties of other options. A
low-value decoy can signal that the target also has low value when both are believed to be
generated by a similar process. For example, a bad product can signal bad brand quality,
indicating that other products from the same brand are probably not as good as they
appear. People may likewise draw shared inferences about two restaurants from the same
franchise, two job candidates from the same training program, two movies from the same
studio, or two fruits from the same basket. We capture this logic in a hierarchical Bayesian
cognitive model (Tenenbaum et al. 2006). Because uncertainty can arise from sources as
diverse as limited information, sensory noise, and constraints on cognitive processing, this
mechanism applies to both economic and perceptual judgment (Woodford 2020). Even
when groups are not explicitly known, people may form inferences about which items
were likely generated by the same underlying statistical process (Anderson 1991). In this
perspective, the repulsion effect may reflect an adaptive function which improves decision
quality, because the context provides information that helps to interpret the available
options (McKenzie et al. 2018, Sher et al. 2022, Bhui and Dubey 2024).
Our theory is consistent with an array of research from marketing as well as cognitive
science. Several empirical studies in quantitative marketing use related models to analyze
how consumers learn about different products from the same brand or category (Erdem
1998, Erdem and Chang 2012, Sridhar et al. 2012, Ching et al. 2013). This formally reflects
psychological research demonstrating that consumers draw category-based inferences about
products (Kardes et al. 2008, Loken et al. 2008). More broadly, an expanding body of work
in cognitive science fruitfully applies hierarchical Bayesian models to explain judgment in a
wide range of domains such as reinforcement learning (Acun˜a and Schrater 2010, Gershman
and Niv 2015), sensory learning (Mathys et al. 2011, 2014), advice taking (Diaconescu
et al. 2014), motion perception (Bill et al. 2020), moral judgment (Kleiman-Weiner et al.
2017), linguistics (Xu and Tenenbaum 2007), and beyond (e.g., Griffiths and Tenenbaum
2009, Tenenbaum et al. 2011, Sharp et al. 2022).
Our hierarchical cognitive modeling approach should not be confused with either hierarchical Bayesian statistical
modeling (Gelman et al. 2013) or hierarchical decision making processes (Tversky et al. 1988, Evangelidis et al.
2018). Purely statistical hierarchical models are only meant to capture individual heterogeneity for purposes of
improved parameter estimation. They make no direct claims about cognitive principles or processes, even though the
mathematical structures we use are the same. The process models trace out a sequence of broad decision strategies
taken by an agent to arrive at a choice. They are not specifically about inferential principles, though these could be
invoked by the strategies they contain.
The main contribution of our paper is to rigorously develop a normative account of
the repulsion effect. By doing so, we provide a unified explanation for its existence across
economic and perceptual domains, and transparently expose the conditions under which
it should emerge. Our formulation also enables a sharper specification of what similarity
entails, and allows this Bayesian tainting hypothesis to be precisely laid out in a variety of
environments. We maximize transparency by deriving closed-form analytical expressions
that encapsulate the repulsion effect.
In what follows, we present our theory and show how it can help account for a number of
previous findings, such as the emergence of the repulsion effect in decisions from experience
(Ert and Lejarraga 2018, Spektor et al. 2019), the double decoy effect (Daviet and Webb
2020), the phantom decoy effect (Pratkanis and Farquhar 1992, Pettibone and Wedell
2007), and the non-monotonic impact of decoy distance on the repulsion effect (Liao et al.
2020). We also conduct four new experiments using hypothetical consumer choice tasks
and incentivized value estimation paradigms which demonstrate that the repulsion effect
is stronger when the target and decoy are believed to come from the same group and have
more correlated values, as predicted by the theory.
Our work yields several benefits. First, our theory helps to account for empirical variation
in the effect observed across past studies and new experiments in a unified way. Second, it
enables us to specify a version of the tainting hypothesis in any setting where an appropriate
causal model can be written down. Third, it offers a normative rationale for the repulsion
effect, linking it with branches of research that explore the adaptive nature of preference
construction (Bettman et al. 1998, McKenzie et al. 2018, Sher et al. 2022) and apparent
cognitive biases (Wernerfelt 1995, Lewis et al. 2014, Gershman et al. 2015a, Griffiths et al.
2015, Lieder and Griffiths 2020, Bhui et al. 2021, Villas-Boas 2023).

2.1. Context Dependence and Inference in Product Evaluation
The design of product lines and the construction of choice sets have long been analyzed in
marketing. When context dependence is incorporated, both academic research and popular
discussion on these topics have focused on the impact of the attraction effect (Kivetz et al.
2004, Ariely 2008, Kamenica 2008, Orhun 2009, Rooderkerk et al. 2011, Chen and Turut
2013, Narasimhan and Turut 2013, Herweg et al. 2017, Zheng et al. 2019, Helfrich and
Herweg 2020, Apffelstaedt and Mechtenberg 2021, Yuan and Xiao 2022). However, the
repulsion effect means that an inferior decoy could negatively affect the target option. Our
work clarifies the conditions under which this kind of backfire could happen. Specifically,
there must be uncertainty about the true value of the product (e.g., because the product
or the consumer is new), uncertainty about the brand or category value (e.g., because the
brand or category is new), and the brand or category must be coherent (i.e., products
must be thought to have similar properties). Furthermore, because our model applies to
perceptual judgment as well, the design attributes considered could include perceptual
features like package size in addition to economic ones.
In this light, the present work is evidently connected to research on umbrella branding.
Strong empirical correlations have been found between consumer perceptions of products
from the same brand (Sullivan 1990, Erdem 1998, Erdem and Swait 1998, Bottomley and
Holden 2001, Erdem and Sun 2002, Erdem et al. 2006, Erdem and Chang 2012). Theoreti-
cal models have shown how correlation between product values can be credibly signaled by
umbrella branding (Wernerfelt 1988, Mikl´os-Thal 2012, Moorthy 2012, Wernerfelt 2012,
Keller 2012), helping to endogenize the type of underlying relationship we suppose is
present. Our formulation of how group structure can be inferred from option attributes
may advance the quantitative modeling of how consumers learn from similar products or
experiences (Kim 2022). This research also contributes to the broad literatures on con-
sumer inference (Kardes et al. 2008) and category-based inference (Loken et al. 2008). For
example, our theory formally recapitulates the experimental findings of Levin and Levin
(2000) that inferences about the qualities of an incompletely described target product are
guided by the qualities of a second, linked product that is more well-defined.
The decoy’s detrimental impact in the repulsion effect raises the question of whether it
could occur in a competitive scenario. This could be possible under the conditions outlined
above, and might have happened in the cola wars during the early 1990s. Crystal Pepsi was
a clear version of Pepsi introduced in 1992 to capitalize on the “clear craze,” a marketing
fad in which transparent versions of products were created to connote purity. Coca-Cola
fought back by coming out with Tab Clear, a clear version of their diet cola Tab, which was
considered inferior to the flagship cola products and reportedly meant to fail and sabotage
Crystal Pepsi in the process. Tab Clear was marketed as a diet drink, a category that was

less popular at the time. Because both drinks were clear colas, the negative perception of
Tab Clear supposedly made consumers believe that Crystal Pepsi had similar undesirable
qualities. As the former chief marketing officer of Coca-Cola asserted (Denny 2013): “This
is like a cola, but it doesn’t have any color. It has all this great taste. And we said,
‘No, Crystal Pepsi is actually a diet drink.’ Even though it wasn’t. Because Tab had the
attributes of diet, which was its demise. That was its problem. It was perceived to be a
medicinal drink. Within three or five months, Tab Clear was dead. And so was Crystal
Pepsi.” While the only record of this tactic came after the fact from the former executive
(who stands to benefit from this narrative) and has not been otherwise corroborated to
our knowledge, it usefully illustrates the conditions we proposed for the effect to emerge:
Crystal Pepsi was a new product and so consumers were not sure how to feel about it,
clear colas formed an unfamiliar category so consumers were unsure about their qualities,
and consumers plausibly felt that different clear colas had similar latent properties.
2.2. Bayesian Models of Context Effects
Bayesian principles have been used before to explain contextual preference reversals like
the attraction effect. For instance, when decision makers are uncertain about how valuable
each attribute is, the presence of a decoy can indicate that the target offers better than
fair market value (Shenoy and Yu 2013, Wernerfelt 1995; see also Kamenica 2008 and Li
and Yu 2018). Alternatively, because the decoy is more similar to the target than to the
competitor, it may be easier to compare (Tversky and Russo 1969, Markman and Medin
1995), thus providing ordinal information which raises the probability that the target
is the best option (Howes et al. 2016, Natenzon 2019). Bayesian inference may also be
combined with the non-Bayesian assumption that preferences reflect deviations from one’s
expectations (Rigoli et al. 2017). However, while all of these models appeal to inferential
mechanisms not unlike our own, they are designed to generate attraction effects and do
not naturally produce repulsion effects.
Our approach is closest to Bordley’s (1992) analysis of context sensitivity in the domain
of risky choice (see also Luce and Raiffa 1957, p. 288). Following Viscusi (1989), he supposes
that people do not take stated lottery outcomes at face value, and instead form assessments
by adjusting their prior beliefs about lotteries toward the stated outcomes in a Bayesian
Though we isolate the repulsion effect in our paper for clarity, in the Appendix we present simulations from a unified
model that can produce both effects, by integrating our focal mechanism with that of Shenoy and Yu (2013).
fashion. He considers how various anomalies including one like the repulsion effect can
occur when some lotteries have correlated outcomes (though this connection has gone
unnoticed in the literature on repulsion effects to date). For example, suppose a customer
at a restaurant must choose between beef, fish, and chicken, and that the quality of only
the latter two depend heavily on the competence of the chef. Beef might be preferred to
fish when they are the only two options; but if chicken were also available, the presence
of both fish and chicken would indicate that the chef is competent since the restaurant
would not likely advertise two bad dishes. In that case, the customer’s assessment of the
fish would improve, leading them to select fish over beef from a menu of all three meals
even when they would select beef over fish in the absence of chicken. As in our account of
the repulsion effect, the presence of a third item serves as a signal of another item’s value,
leading to a preference reversal that violates independence of irrelevant alternatives (Luce
1959). Our formulation would encode correlated outcomes via the hierarchical structure,
where the group mean denotes the chef’s competence defined as the average quality of
the meals they serve. In addition to the many new applications we present here, we move
beyond Bordley (1992) from a technical standpoint in multiple ways. We allow options
to consist of multiple attributes and we derive similarity itself within the model. These
advances are important for capturing observed properties of repulsion effects as described
below.
3. A Bayesian Model of the Repulsion Effect
We lay out our model in a two-attribute setting where the attributes are continuous vari-
ables such as numeric ratings of quality or price and the objective function takes on an
additive form. Due to the flexibility of the Bayesian framework, our theory can be applied
to a much wider set of attribute types and objective functions through appropriate mod-
ification of the generative process. We will briefly explore such modifications later in the
subsection on Model Extensions.
Consider an agent evaluating a target option and a competitor in the presence of a decoy;
call these T , C, and D respectively. Each option i ∈ {T, C, D} is described by two observable
attributes, which we denote by x and x (and collectively by x ). In traditional models

of multi-attribute choice with additive utility, the value of an option would be given by
v = ω x + ω x for some coefficients ω and ω that reflect the subjective importance
i 1 i,1 2 i,2 1 2
placed on each attribute. In the standard view, agents place intrinsic value on various
attributes. Hence, customers might be thought to place a particular intrinsic value on a
restaurant with a high quality rating. We propose instead that the observable attributes
are merely superficial manifestations of an option’s latent properties, and the agent does
not have perfect access to the true values of options. In this view, a high quality rating
is merely a signal of how good the customer’s experience would be. It is noisy, since a
high rating does not guarantee a great experience, but it is informative, and helps the
customer construct an estimate of value. We take the agent’s evaluation to be the expected
value of each option conditional on the set of options (defined in terms of their observable
attributes), E[v | x ∀j].

We assume the agent forms evaluations by inverting a hierarchical Bayesian generative

a value-orthogonal characteristic that determines the relative balance between attributes
1 and 2, holding value fixed. For example, two restaurants may be equally desirable overall
even though one has better service if it is exactly offset by worse food; in our terminology,
they have the same value but different styles. Technically speaking, value indicates which
indifference curve an option resides on, while style indicates an option’s position along that
indifference curve. This kind of decomposition has been used before under other names
(Wedell 1991, Rooderkerk et al. 2011, Berkowitsch et al. 2015). Although style does not
bear directly on value, it will do so indirectly by affecting how similar the target and decoy
are judged to be in the absence of explicit labels (see the subsection on Latent Group
Inference).
An option’s observable attributes are generated from its latent properties according to
a common objective function and corrupted by noise. Specifically, we model this observa-
tion noise in two steps, roughly following Shenoy and Yu (2013): we first add Gaussian
noise to the option’s latent properties of style and value, and then map these noisy vari-
ables to attribute space by inverting the objective function. Accordingly, let vˆ ≡ v + ε

noise occurs in the latent space, and so the same amount of noise translates into a small
difference for attributes that are more important and a large difference for attributes that
are less important. We make the assumption that noise occurs in the value-style space for
mathematical simplicity, but could suppose that noise directly impacts the attribute level
without greatly altering the results. Our construction implies that (x , x ) and (vˆ , sˆ )

In a consumer choice setting, for instance, v˜ might reflect brand quality—the average value
of a random product from the brand that option i belongs to. Then σ˜ would capture the
degree to which different products from the brand vary in value, and σ would capture
the degree of noise in how precisely the observable attributes of a product signal its latent
value. Importantly, the group-level means v˜ and s˜ are themselves unknown and must be

assume noninformative uniform hyperpriors for v˜ and s˜ given σ˜ and σ˜ respectively.

A key assumption of our theory is that people believe the target and decoy are generated
by a shared underlying process, which implies they share the same group-level means,
v˜ = v˜ = v˜ and s˜ = s˜ = s˜ . As a consequence, the attributes of the decoy provide

information about the value of the target. We suppose for the moment that explicit labels
are provided which induce this belief, but will later relax this in the subsection on Latent
Group Inference.

N (0, σ ). Both kinds of noise could even be included simultaneously, at the expense of clarity.
Given the above setup, we can derive the posterior mean of the target’s latent value
when the decoy is present and when it is absent, conditional on observed attributes. The
result is stated in the following proposition (derived in the Appendix).
Proposition 1.
Let E[v |x , x ] and E[v |x ] represent the posterior expected values

transparently reveals the conditions necessary for it to emerge. The effect depends crucially
on the cohesiveness of the group, reflected in the parameter σ˜ , and the level of uncertainty
about option values, reflected in σ . The decoy and target values must be informatively
drawn from the same group, meaning σ˜ must be small; the effect vanishes as σ˜ grows

that E[v | x , x ] − E[v | x ] = −(E[v | x , x ] − E[v | x ]).

3.1. Latent Group Inference
The above expressions assume the decision maker knows that the target and decoy come
from the same group. For instance, when describing bottled water options, Frederick et al.
(2014) explicitly label both the target and decoy as kinds of spring water, in contrast to
the competitor; or when depicting microwave popcorn, the target and decoy are shown to
be from the same brand which is different from the competitor. However, such information
is not always given. For example, the rectangles in Spektor et al.’s (2018) perceptual task
are not overtly assigned to particular groups. Even a label might be considered as any
other attribute, just one that strongly predicts group identity. The decision maker must
ultimately group items together of their own accord based on their sense of similarity.
We cast these similarity assessments as Bayesian inference of latent group structure
(Austerweil et al. 2015). Models in this vein have been usefully applied to understand judg-
ment in various settings such as category assignment (Anderson 1991), social evaluation

2007, Sato et al. 2007, Shams and Beierholm 2010, Cao et al. 2019), reinforcement learning
(Gershman et al. 2010, 2015b), and anchoring (Wilson et al. 2021). Our approach is also
motivated by Kemp et al. (2005) who show how several common similarity measures can
be derived from a unified Bayesian framework. Rather than being an alternative to clas-
sic conceptions of similarity (Tversky 1977, Bhui 2018), Bayesian principles can provide
deeper foundations that inform us about the properties of similarity functions.
To incorporate uncertainty about group membership, we apply the law of total expecta-
tion to the posterior mean of target value, splitting it into cases where the target and decoy
come from the same group (i.e., the same higher-level distribution) versus different groups
be almost definitely from a different group, though this can be relaxed naturally by explic-
itly considering all possible combinations of options (see subsection on Model Extensions).
Notice that the dimension of style is important here so that the target and the decoy are
classified together on the basis of their stylistic similarity, rather than the target and the
competitor which are typically closer in terms of value.

The resulting expression resembles that in Proposition 1, modified by a multiplier encod-
ing the probability that the target and decoy are thought to be from the same group.
This probability can be computed from Bayes’ rule, considering the relative probabilities
that the two items came from the same generative process or two different ones, using a
maximum a posteriori (MAP) approximation for clarity.
Observe three properties of this result. First, the probability that the target and the
decoy are grouped together is decreasing in the distance between them, as we expect from
a measure of similarity. Its functional form traces out a logistic gradient with further Gaus-
sian decay. Second, the gradient is shallower when group-level dispersion and observation
noise are high. Intuitively, this happens because variation makes it more plausible that
items which appear quite different are actually generated by the same underlying process.
The distance between items is measured in terms of how many standard deviations apart
they are, providing a domain-general metric. Third, the assessment is tied to the prior
probability that items come from the same group. This prior probability expresses the
agent’s default belief that two items were generated by the same process when nothing is
known about their attributes.
3.2. Model Extensions
Although we made a number of assumptions for clarity, many of them can be relaxed to
encompass a wider variety of environments. Many extensions are relatively standard in the
Bayesian framework, such as allowing options to have different signal precisions or numbers
of signals (Berger 1985, Gelman et al. 2013). Here are several further ways to extend the
model and broaden its applicability.
1. Different objective functions can be used. In particular, value could come from the
ω ω
product of the attributes as with expected utility or Cobb-Douglas preferences, v = x 1 x 2
i,1 i,2
or equivalently log(v ) = ω log(x ) + ω log(x ). This functional form with ω = ω = 1
i 1 i,1 2 i,2 1 2
could also capture perceptual judgments of rectangle size based on the product of width
and height. Roughly following Shenoy and Yu (2013), the objective function in the Cobb-
Douglas case can be inverted to find attribute magnitudes such that log(vˆ ) = ω log(x ) +
i 1 i,1
1+sˆ
2ω
ω log(x ) and sˆ log(vˆ ) = ω log(x ) − ω log(x ), which yields x = vˆ 1 and x =
2 i,2 i i 1 i,1 2 i,2 i,1 i,2
1−sˆ
2ω
vˆ 2 . Note that v˜ , v and vˆ here should be positive. They might be modeled by gamma
i i i
distributions as in Shenoy and Yu (2013), or by normal distributions truncated below at
zero. When these distributions have a sufficiently large mean (relative to variance), they
are approximately Gaussian; hence, when values are not too close to the zero bound, this
setting should be approximated by the Gaussian structure assumed in the unbounded
additive case, leading to similar conclusions.
2. Any number of options may be considered. The calculations of the posterior mean and
group membership can be altered accordingly. Redefine g = (g , . . . , g ) to represent the
1 N
grouping of all N options, where g is an index of option i’s group membership taking on
integer value k between 1 and K. Then the posterior mean value of option i’s group becomes
(cid:80)
the average of signal values of all options in that group, E[v˜ |x ] = vˆ .
i j:g =g j
j i |{j:g =g }| j:g =g
j i j i
The computation of group membership must sum over all combinations of options, so
P (x ∀j|g)P (g)
P (g | x ∀j) = j where g iterates over all possible groupings. We may also
j (cid:80)

suppose that the prior probability of a group assignment is given by the Chinese restaurant
process (Aldous 1985, Gershman and Blei 2012), a nonparametric Bayesian model which
has the capacity to accommodate any number of groups. The prior probability of grouping

g is then given by P (g | α, N ) = j where Γ(·) is the gamma function

and α is the concentration parameter that represents how strongly items tend to cluster
into large groups. When α = 0, all items will be part of the same group, while in the limit
as α → ∞, each item will constitute its own unique group. In the two-item case above,
α 1 P (g=2)
P (g = 2) = and P (g = 1) = , so = α.
1+α 1+α P (g=1)
3. Any number of latent properties or observable attributes may be considered. Let x
be an M -dimensional vector of observable attributes with mth element x , let y be an
i,m i
L-dimensional vector of latent properties (one of which represents value) with ℓth element
y , and let yˆ = y + ε be a noise-corrupted signal of the latent properties where ε ∼
i,ℓ i i i i
2 2
N (0, σ I) denotes noise with an L-dimensional vector of variances σ that has ℓth element
σ 2 . Similarly, suppose y ∼ N (y˜ , σ˜ 2 I) with L-dimensional mean and variance vectors.
i i
Assume that x = Zyˆ for some M × L matrix Z that transforms latent properties into
i i
observable attributes, and hence yˆ = Z −1 x . For example, in the case laid out earlier with
i i

M = L = 2, y = [ v i ], yˆ = vˆ i , Z = 2ω 1 2ω 2 , and Z −1 = [ ω 1 ω 2 ]. Then E[y |x ∀j] =

same group as i.
4. An informative hyperprior over values can be incorporated. People may come into
a task with an initial bias. For example, Viscusi (1989) proposed that an individual’s
predisposition for optimism or pessimism could color their perceptions of risky gambles.
This bias at a higher level might be a fruitful way to model individual differences. Suppose
˜ ˜
that the decision maker holds a hyperprior over values such that v˜ ∼ N (v˜, σ˜ ). Then the
Bayesian estimates of the group mean become

Note that the original solution with an uninformative hyperprior is recovered as σ˜ → ∞.
Moreover, when there is no uncertainty in the group mean, σ˜ = 0, the decoy has no effect
on the estimate of the target value.
5. Variation may be treated as uncertain. Although we supposed the degree of variation
along each dimension at each level was known by the decision maker, people might instead
learn about variances based on how items cluster together (Anderson 1991, Navarro and
Kemp 2017, Andr´e et al. 2022). This learning would affect the strength of assimilation and
inference about latent groups. Such local calibration could help explain how context effects
may manifest differently in disparate environments and occur at all scales.
6. Different attribute types can be analyzed. This flexibility lets us define similarity
and apply the tainting hypothesis in a wide range of environments. For instance, options
may consist of features which are either categorically present or absent, so options can
be represented as binary vectors. In this setting, Kemp et al. (2005) have shown how
Tversky’s (1977) contrast model can be recovered if the feature vectors are generated by
a beta-Bernoulli model, demonstrating a link between latent group inference and classic
theories of similarity.
7. Different beliefs about latent group structure may be explored. Such versatility can
be useful when describing how judgments may differ across economic markets or perceptual
modalities. For example, people might think that in markets, companies strive to create
diversified product lines. This belief could imply that products which have overly similar
attributes are actually likely to have come from different brands. In theory, this might
even produce an attraction-like effect, as the decoy could be grouped together with the
competitor to the benefit of the target. Beliefs about market structure could also emerge
from strategic equilibria that might affect the information content of the choice set (e.g.,
Kamenica 2008).
8. The attraction effect can be incorporated by the inclusion of uncertainty over the
relative attribute weighting (Shenoy and Yu 2013, Wernerfelt 1995). The decoy can provide
information about this component of preference in addition to being a signal of overall
target value. In the Appendix, we provide proof-of-concept simulations of a unified Bayesian
model that yields an attraction-repulsion continuum based on the degree of uncertainty in
various parameters.
4. Applications to Previous Findings
In this section, we discuss several factors that have been observed to modulate context
dependence, and show how our proposed mechanism might yield this systematic variation.
4.1. Decisions from Experience
A body of work studies the difference between decisions when the attributes of options are
explicitly described versus when they must be learned from experience (e.g., Hertwig et al.
2004, Hertwig and Erev 2009). For example, an agent may be told that a gamble offers
a 10 payoff with a 50% probability, or they may acquire a sample of realized outcomes
from which they must estimate these quantities. The resulting estimates may be noisy and
distorted in various ways. Ert and Lejarraga (2018) conducted repeated-choice tasks in
which participants were either provided with explicit descriptions of risky gambles or had
to learn their properties from experience, and observed a repulsion effect only in the latter
case. Spektor et al. (2019) also observed a repulsion effect in a learning-from-experience
task. To accommodate this phenomenon, they extended a basic reinforcement learning
model such that representations of options could interact with each other in the updating
process. Their augmentation consisted of a mechanism in which similar options (like the
target and decoy) tend to inhibit each other, benefiting other options (like the competitor).
Decisions from experience rely on noisier estimates of value (e.g., Fox and Hadar 2006).
Through the lens of our theory, this noise should be counteracted by Bayesian regularization
toward other options from the same group. Hence, the evaluation of the target should be
more subject to repulsion in decisions from experience. This mechanism is visualized in
In a dynamic setting, our proposed mechanism is related to hierarchical Bayesian mod-
els of reinforcement learning that invoke latent statistical structure. For example, when
consumers learn about different products from the same brand or category, there can be

spillover because experience with one product is informative about the quality of the oth-
ers. Evidence for such correlated learning of option values has been found in abstract
reward learning tasks (Acun˜a and Schrater 2010, Wu et al. 2018, Schulz et al. 2020) and the
exploration patterns of fishermen (Marcoul and Weninger 2008), as well as the purchase
behavior of consumers (Erdem 1998, Erdem and Chang 2012, Sridhar et al. 2012, Ching
et al. 2013). An inferior decoy would thus reduce the appraised value of the associated
target. Note that many previous models encode higher-order relationships in terms of fixed
correlation parameters connecting different options. Our model allows these correlations
to be derived based on the agent’s probabilistic assessment of whether the items were
generated by the same latent process.
4.2. The Double Decoy Effect
Typical studies on the decoy effect include only a single decoy. However, Daviet and Webb
(2020) conducted experiments with preferential choices in which a second decoy superior
to the first one was added to the choice set. They observed that the addition of the
second decoy made the target less appealing, cancelling out the attraction effect. As the
second decoy does not extend the range of attributes beyond the first, this finding is
difficult to account for with traditional models of range normalization (e.g., Volkmann
1951, Soltani et al. 2012). Daviet and Webb (2020) explained the data with a model in
which attribute values are compared and normalized in a pairwise fashion, and they used
hierarchical Bayesian statistical techniques to accommodate individual heterogeneity in
model parameters.

We provide an alternative (though not mutually exclusive) explanation. In light of our
theory, the second decoy provides further information about the group value, and furnishes
an additional signal that the target may be worse than it appears. This extra signal should
thus further bias the target’s estimate downward. It might also increase the tendency to
group the target and decoys together because its presence in between the target and the
for illustration.
Similar mechanisms have been found to describe a variety of judgments (Austerweil et al.
2015). For example, Bayesian models of latent structure can capture the flexibility and
speed with which arbitrary social groups and subgroups can be constructed in ways that
simple dyadic similarity models cannot, as well as the resulting patterns of interpersonal
judgment (Gershman and Cikara 2020). The introduction of an extra person with attributes
in between two others has been found to increase the tendency to group those two together
and the corresponding degree of social influence (Gershman et al. 2017, Lau et al. 2018).
4.3. The Phantom Decoy Effect
Phantom decoys, different from standard decoys, are typically superior to the target option
but unavailable at the time of choice. Despite being dominant rather than dominated, they
have been found to increase preference for the target in economic tasks (e.g., Pratkanis
and Farquhar 1992, Highhouse 1996, Pettibone and Wedell 2000, 2007, Scarpi 2011, Scarpi
and Pizzi 2013). Farquhar and Pratkanis (1993) recognized that phantom alternatives may
contain information that helps to contextualize the value of other options and can thereby
facilitate choice (Fischhoff et al. 1980, p. 124). Our theory provides a formalization of this
idea.
Attribute 1
etubirttA

etubirttA
repulsion effect (left).
Notice that, aside from the unavailability of the decoy, this phantom decoy effect mirrors
the repulsion effect. In the former case, a superior decoy favors the option it dominates;
illustrates the relationship. In our Experiment 1b, described later, we demonstrate that
the repulsion effect occurs even when the inferior decoy is a phantom.
One prominent account of the phantom decoy effect is the similarity-substitution hypoth-
esis, according to which people default to the target option as an effort-saving strategy
when the preferred decoy is not available because it is the most similar alternative (Tversky
1972, Pettibone and Wedell 2000, 2007). Our Bayesian account offers further nuance to this
hypothesis. First, it provides an alternative adaptive rationale for similarity-based judg-
ment. Rather than effort minimization, the effect could stem from principles of inference
under uncertainty. Second, it provides a refinement of what form similarity takes. Rather
than a simple exponential function, similarity can manifest in different ways depending
on the generative process assumed by the decision maker. Third, it integrates this simi-
larity judgment into the overall effect of the decoy. This yields new implications for how
the strength of the effect depends non-monotonically on the attribute distance between
the decoy and the target, in contrast to previous hypotheses which predict monotonic
relationships (Scarpi and Pizzi 2013). We elaborate on this non-monotonicity in the next
subsection.
4.4. Non-Monotonic Effect of Decoy Distance
Decoys can be close to or far from the target in attribute space, and the strength of the
repulsion effect appears to be modulated by this attribute distance. In consumer choice,

the probability that the decoy is judged to be from the same group as the target.
Liao et al. (2020) found that distance has a U-shaped effect on the strength of the repulsion
effect. That is, preference for the target first declines and then grows again as the decoy
becomes more distant.
This non-monotonic effect can occur in our model due to the conjunction of two factors
determining the repulsion effect. First, when the decoy is moved farther away from the
target, it constitutes a more negative signal. This effect grows linearly in the distance
between the target and decoy. Second, the farther away the decoy is, the less likely it was
generated by the same process as the target. This effect is decreasing at an approximately
logistic-Gaussian rate. The product of these forces yields an initial enhancement of the
repulsion effect (when the first force is stronger) followed by a decline (when the second
Such a mechanism has been found to capture analogous patterns in multisensory per-
ception (K¨ording et al. 2007, Sato et al. 2007, Shams and Beierholm 2010, Cao et al. 2019).
People draw causal inferences about whether two sensory cues originate from the same
source (i.e., from the same location) or different sources, based on how concordant the
cues are and the level of uncertainty in each one. This is why successful ventriloquists, for
example, maximize the synchrony between the puppet’s facial movements and the sound
of their speech. When cues are close together, they are likely caused by the same source,
We note that there have been mixed results in the literature. For example, Liao et al. (2020) found an inverted U-
shaped effect of decoy distance in perceptual judgment. We conjecture that this pattern could arise from an analogous
similarity-based mechanism applied to the attraction effect. Indeed, some have argued that the attraction effect may
be modulated by perceived similarity between the target and decoy (Mishra et al. 1993, Izakson et al. 2020). In the
Appendix, we provide simulations that nest both the attraction and repulsion effect in the same Bayesian model, by
incorporating inference about the relative values of the attributes and extending latent group inference accordingly.
We demonstrate that this model can produce both U-shaped and inverted U-shaped patterns, depending on which
aspect of inference is more influential.
and the best estimate of the source’s location falls in between the cues (closer to the more
precise signal). When the cues are far apart, they are likely caused by different sources, and
the best estimates of the source locations are close to each cue separately. The estimated
location of a cue’s source is thus nonlinear in the distance between the cues. A similar
observation has been made regarding anchoring and hindsight bias (Wilson et al. 2021).
Knowledge of an outcome serves as an anchor that pulls recollections toward it. This bias
depends non-monotonically on the distance between the anchor and the original estimate
(Hardt and Pohl 2003), which can be explained by the combination of the information
provided by the anchor and the reduction in the anchor’s plausibility as it increasingly
deviates from expectations.
5. Experiments
Our theory makes novel predictions about the ingredients needed for the repulsion effect
to occur. We conducted new experiments to test some of these predictions. First, the deci-
sion maker must believe the target and the decoy come from the same group. Second,
because the decoy is providing information about the target, its presence may still have an
effect even when it cannot be chosen. Third, observable attributes must be noisy signals of
underlying value, and the values of the target and decoy must be meaningfully correlated.
Accordingly, we ran consumer choice experiments in which we varied group membership,
both when the decoy was available (Experiment 1a) and when it was an unavailable phan-
tom (Experiment 1b), and we ran value estimation tasks in which we varied statistical
properties of the environment (Experiment 2a) and made the group structure implicit
(Experiment 2b). To foreshadow our results, we found that repulsion effects indeed emerged
more strongly when the target and decoy were grouped together (even when the decoy was
unavailable), when attribute noise was high and value dispersion was low, and when group
membership could be more clearly inferred from stimulus attributes.
5.1. Experiment 1a
In Experiment 1a, we explicitly manipulated the group structure underlying the options
in a consumer choice setting, either saying that the target and decoy came from the same
group, or that the three options came from different groups. This allowed us to test our
primary hypothesis that the repulsion effect would occur when people believed that the
target and decoy were generated by a similar process. If the repulsion effect did not depend
on this belief, there should be no differences in participants’ preferences across the two
conditions.
Participants 449 participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk using
CloudResearch. They received a 0.50 participation fee for completing the experiment. To
ensure data quality, participants answered an attention check question at the end of the
experiment, which can be seen in the Supplemental Materials. A total of 372 participants
passed the attention check, and are included in the analyses below. The sample size was
determined based on a power calculation which indicated that it would provide 90% power
to detect a 3-point shift (corresponding to a Cohen’s d of about 0.1 according to pretests)
at the 5% significance level assuming 20% exclusion from participants failing the attention
check and 2% loss of data from technical glitches, when pooling across all stimuli. The
experiment was approved by the local IRB. All participants gave informed consent prior
to their participation.
Procedure Each participant made three hypothetical consumer choices based on stimuli
borrowed from existing paradigms: Italian restaurants (adapted from Sen 1998), cans of
orange juice (adapted from Ratneshwar et al. 1987), and lottery tickets (adapted from
Huber et al. 1982). Each of these three choices consisted of three different options, with
attributes that corresponded to a target, a competitor, and a decoy. The stimulus attributes
are listed in the Supplemental Materials. Participants indicated the strength of their pref-
of the task.
We used a between-subjects design in which participants were randomly assigned to one
of two conditions. Participants in the “same group” condition were explicitly told in all
three choices that the target and decoy came from the same brand or were managed by the
same group of people; participants in the “different groups” condition were told that all
three options came from different brands or were managed by different groups of people.
This text was emphasized to ensure participants were aware of it. They had unlimited time
to answer the questions.
To counterbalance the target and competitor identity, for each question we designed a
separate decoy for each side (randomly assigned to participants), inferior in one dimension.
This allows us to eliminate the effect of target identity by pooling together data across
options were from different groups or that the target and decoy came from the same group.
both decoy sides. Each option had two attributes (e.g., Quality and Price). There were
two versions of each stimulus that were roughly matched, a qualitative version with ver-
bally described attributes and a quantitative version with numerically described attributes.
These versions were randomized within each participant, meaning every participant would
face one choice for each of the three stimulus types but could have a mix of quantitative
and qualitative versions of each. Pretests were conducted to avoid floor and ceiling effects.
The order of choice problems was counterbalanced. The results presented below pool across
all three questions and both attribute versions.
Exclusions We excluded 77 participants for failing the end-of-task attention check.
Results When all three options came from different groups, there was no significant
difference between the points assigned to the target and the competitor [45.4 vs 45.4;
t(497) = −0.03, p = .974]; the decoy seemed to have no effect. However, a repulsion effect

emerged when the target and decoy came from the same group, as points assigned to
the target were significantly lower than points assigned to the competitor [40.6 vs 48.0;
t(617) = −3.45, p < .001]. This difference corresponded to a significant drop in points
assigned to the target across conditions [t(1040.3) = −2.92, p = .004], as predicted by the
theory. As another hallmark of the theory, the difference was accompanied by an increase in
the pattern.
5.2. Experiment 1b
The aim of Experiment 1b was to determine whether the results of Experiment 1a could
be extended to a phantom decoy paradigm, in which the inferior decoy was present but
not available to be chosen.
Participants 449 participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk using
CloudResearch. They received a 0.50 participation fee for completing the experiment.
To ensure data quality, participants answered an attention check question at the end of
the experiment. A total of 410 participants passed the attention check, and are included
in the analyses below. The sample size was determined similarly to Experiment 1a. The
experiment was approved by the local IRB. All participants gave informed consent prior
to their participation.

Procedure The procedure was similar to that of Experiment 1a, except that partici-
pants allocated points only to the target and competitor. Thus, the group structure was
manipulated while the decoy did not directly enter into the preference comparison.
Exclusions We excluded 39 participants for failing the end-of-task attention check.
Results Similar to results of Experiment 1a, when the target, decoy, and competitor came
from different groups, the number of points assigned to the target was not significantly
different from points assigned to the competitor [50.6 vs 49.4; t(632) = 0.47, p = .640].
However, fewer than half the points were assigned to the target in the condition where
the target and decoy came from the same group, indicating a significant repulsion effect
[46.4 vs 53.6; t(596) = −2.89, p = .004]. This difference corresponded to a significant drop

5.3. Discussion
Participants preferred the target option less when it came from the same group as the
inferior decoy, leading to a repulsion effect. Preference for the decoy grew in tandem. The
decline in preference for the target occurred even when preference for the decoy was not
elicited.
5.4. Experiment 2a
The goal of Experiment 2a was to test whether the repulsion effect varies depending on
uncertainty in the environment. Specifically, the effect should be stronger when attributes
are noisier signals of value and there is little dispersion in the values of members from
the same group, meaning there is a high noise-to-dispersion ratio. To precisely control the
statistical properties of the environment and measure how this influences the formation of
beliefs, we turned to a different paradigm based on value estimation. This task was also
incentivized and repeatable, so the same participant could be posed many trials.
Participants 80 participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk using
CloudResearch. They received a base pay of 1.00 for participation and a performance
bonus up to 3.50. To ensure that participants understood the rules, they completed a com-
prehension check before they were allowed to move on to the main task. Those who failed
the check were given the option to try again or review the instructions again, until they
correctly answered all the comprehension check questions. The experiment was approved
by the local IRB. All participants gave informed consent prior to their participation.
Procedure Participants were instructed to imagine themselves as gold miners in the
Wild West, borrowing task stimuli and aesthetics from Dorfman et al. (2019). On each
trial, they were shown three mines, and had to provide their best guess of how much
gold would be found in each one. Noisy signals of these true values were presented as test
absolute error between their guesses and the true values. Two of the mines were shown
to be from the same mountain, leading to correlated values, while the third was from a
different mountain. We refer to a given one of the first two mines as the “target mine,”
the other mine from the same mountain as the “decoy mine” (though it is not necessarily
inferior to the target), and the mine from a different mountain as the “competitor mine.”
The equivalent of the repulsion effect in this task occurs when the estimated value of the
target mine is biased by the signal of the decoy mine.
All of the values were drawn from a hierarchical distribution similar to the generative
model in our theory, with independent draws across trials. The expected values of each
mountain were drawn from a discrete uniform distribution ranging between 50 and 150
in increments of 1. The value of each mine was drawn from a Gaussian distribution with
(competitor mine) and the two mines on the right are from another mountain (target mine and decoy
mine). Participants were presented with the test samples and reported their guesses of the true values
of each mine. They then received feedback on the true values.
mean equal to the value of the mountain it belonged to and variance (i.e., dispersion) that
depended on the experimental condition. Thus, these values were positively correlated for
the two mines from the same mountain. The noisy signals were drawn from Gaussian dis-
tributions with mean equal to the mine value and variance (i.e., noise) that again depended
on the experimental condition. Values were redrawn in the rare case they fell below 0.
Participants completed two blocks of 20 trials each. In one block, the standard deviation
of the mine values was 15 while the standard deviation of the noisy signal was 5, yielding a
low noise-to-dispersion ratio. In the other block, the two standard deviations were reversed,
yielding a high noise-to-dispersion ratio. The order of blocks was counterbalanced. Partic-
ipants received feedback on the true mine values after each trial. To help them become
acquainted with the value distributions, we also showed them 10 training examples before
each block.

If the repulsion effect is modulated by the noise-to-dispersion ratio as the theory predicts,
the experimental manipulation should affect how participants’ guesses rely on the test
sample from each mine. When the ratio is higher, participants’ estimates of the target
mine should rely relatively less on the target mine’s own test sample and more on the test
sample of the decoy mine. Assuming they know the generative process well enough, they
should not rely on the test sample of the competitor mine in any case.
Exclusions We excluded 11 outlier trials where participants’ guesses were 500 away from
the test sample, comprising 0.34% of the total trials.
Results To quantify how participants integrated the various pieces of information, we
analyzed the data using a random-effects regression which predicted participants’ estimates
of the mine values based on the experimental condition, the test values of all three mines,
and the interactions between condition and each of these signals, with subject-level random
effects for all the regressors. This regression included only the pooled responses for the two
mines from the same mountain, as estimates for the other mine would not be expected to
have the same pattern.

was indicated by a statistically significant negative interaction between experimental con-
dition (a dummy variable equal to 1 when the noise-to-dispersion ratio was high) and
the target mine test value [t(970.0) = −9.24, p < .001] as well as a significant positive
interaction between condition and the decoy mine test value [t(2454) = 4.34, p < .001]. No
significant effect was observed for the interaction between condition and competitor mine
test value [t(818.5) = 0.50, p = .617], and the competitor test value coefficients were not
significantly different from 0 in either condition [t(82.2) = 1.13, p = .261 in the low noise-to-
dispersion ratio condition, and t(81.2) = 1.27, p = .207 in the high noise-to-dispersion ratio
condition], indicating no reliance on this unrelated signal. The intercept reflects reliance
on the hyperprior, the distribution of mountain values, which had a mean of 100. The
increase of the intercept in the high noise-to-dispersion ratio condition [t(1667) = 4.90,
p < .001] implies that participants relied more on this hyperprior as well, also consistent
with Bayesian principles.
5.5. Experiment 2b
In previous experiments, we explicitly told participants the group structure. In Experiment
2b, we withheld information about group membership in order to examine how latent group
inference modulates the repulsion effect. To alter this inference, we showed participants
the style of each item and varied the level of noise along this value-neutral dimension.
This allowed us to keep the value distributions intact. We hypothesized that participants
would infer group membership based on how similar the styles were in statistical terms,
and would use that assessment to guide their guesses of mine values. When style noise
is low, mines can be easily assigned to the correct mountains, and their estimated values
should be more biased by the other mine from the same mountain.
Participants 86 participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk using
CloudResearch. They received a base payment of 2.00 for participation and a performance
bonus up to 7.00. To ensure that participants understood the rules, they completed a
comprehension check before they were allowed to move on to the main task. Those who
failed the comprehension check were given the option to try again or review the instruc-
tions again, until they correctly answered all the comprehension check questions. To make
sure that they paid attention, participants also completed an attention check at the end of
each block, which can be seen in the Supplemental Materials. Five participants failed at
least one attention check. The experiment was approved by the local IRB. All participants
gave informed consent prior to their participation.
Procedure Similar to the procedure of Experiment 2a, participants were in the role
of miners in the Wild West, estimating the values of three mines. However, there were
belonged to which mountains. They only knew that two out of the three mines were from
the same mountain and the remaining mine was from a different mountain. They had to
infer which mine was from a different mountain and report their guess; this single response
summarizes the entire group structure. Second, instead of mining for gold, participants
mined for a mix of red ore and blue ore, which translated into total dollar values. In
addition to test samples for each mine (i.e., noisy signals of the true values), they were
shown the ratio of red to blue ore found in the sample. Although both kinds of ore had
equal value, and participants were informed of this fact, this multi-attribute description
could help assign mines to mountains. Participants again received bonus payments based
on the absolute error between their value estimates and the true values. Additionally, they
received 2.5 cents for every time they correctly identified the mine which belonged to a
different mountain.
The value of each mountain was drawn from a discrete uniform distribution ranging
between 100 and 200 in increments of 1. The value of each mine was drawn from a Gaussian
samples and the red-to-blue ratios of each mine, without knowing which two mines belonged to
the same mountain. They reported their guesses of the true values of each mine and which mine
came from a different mountain. They then received feedback. Colored borders indicated mountain
memberships; the mine with a green border was from one mountain (competitor mine), and the two
mines with an orange border were from another mountain (target mine and decoy mine).
distribution with mean equal to the value of the mountain it belonged to and a stan-
dard deviation of 5. The noisy signals were drawn from Gaussian distributions with mean
equal to the mine value and a standard deviation of 15. The styles of each mine were
drawn from Gaussian distributions with a mean of −20 (mountain containing one mine) or
+20 (mountain containing two mines) and variance depending on the experimental condi-
tion, translating into red-blue ratios averaging 0.8 and 1.3. All attribute magnitudes were
redrawn in the rare case they fell below 0.
Participants completed two blocks of 20 trials each. In one block, the standard deviation
of the mine styles was 2. In the other block, the standard deviation of the mine styles was
50. The order of the blocks was counterbalanced. Higher style noise would lead to more
overlap between the ore ratio distributions of the two mountains. Participants received
feedback on the true mine values and the membership of each mine after every trial. To
help them become acquainted with the value distributions and the relationship between
style and group membership, they were shown 15 training examples before each block. In
these examples, they were first asked to make a guess of which mine was from a different
mountain based on the test samples with noisy signals and styles, and then the true mine
values and mountain assignments were revealed.
If participants relied on the styles of the mines to help infer latent group structure,
then they should make more accurate inferences when style noise is low. Moreover, if the
repulsion effect depends on the ability to correctly infer latent group structure, participants’
estimates of target mine value should rely relatively less on the target’s own test sample
and more on the decoy mine’s test sample when style noise is low.
Exclusions One participant did not understand the task correctly and entered only 1,
2, or 3 in the guesses of total ore value, so we excluded this participant from our analysis.
We also excluded the five participants who failed at least one attention check. Data was
analyzed from the remaining 80 participants. We attempted to exclude trials where par-
ticipants’ guesses were 500 away from the test sample, as with Experiment 2a, but there
were no such trials. We also removed 8 trials where the amount of blue ore was 0 leading
to an undefined red-blue ratio.
Results Participants more accurately identified the mines belonging to each mountain in
the low style noise condition (92.5% correct) as compared to the high style noise condition
(46.8% correct), a statistically significant difference according to a paired (within-subjects)
t-test [t(79) = −20.42, p < .001].
As in Experiment 2a, we analyzed the data using a random-effects regression which
predicted participants’ guesses of the mine values based on the experimental condition (a
dummy variable equaling 1 in the high style noise condition), the test values of all three

high, participants’ estimates of the target mine value relied more on the target mine’s own
signal and were influenced less by the decoy mine’s signal, as predicted. These results were
indicated by a statistically significant positive interaction between condition and target
mine test value [t(151.4) = 5.68, p < .001] and a significant negative interaction between
condition and decoy mine test value [t(218.9) = −3.19, p = .002]. Though not predicted by
the model in this setting, there was no significant interaction between condition and the test
value of the competitor mine [t(139.7) = −1.62, p = .109] or the intercept [t(137.3) = −1.24,
p = .216].
5.6. Discussion
Participants’ estimates of target mine value were biased toward the decoy mine signal,
especially when noise was high and dispersion was low (meaning their attributes were
worse predictors of true value and their true values were more correlated). Even when
mines were not explicitly grouped together, target mine value estimates were biased more
when low noise in the stylistic attribute allowed participants to more accurately infer group
structure.
6. Concluding Remarks
Empirical demonstrations of context-dependent preferences have long been posed as chal-
lenges to traditional theories assuming economic rationality. And yet, the instability which
so intrigues us is also what makes these phenomena hard to reliably grasp. Context effects
still inspire behavioral decision theorists to search for their underlying principles, the stable
mechanisms which can consistently explain when they will emerge and when they won’t.
In this paper, we put forth an account of the repulsion effect, a recently documented con-
text effect in which the presence of an inferior decoy option makes the target option which
dominates it seem less appealing. It has been observed in both economic and perceptual
judgment, and contrasts with the four-decade-old attraction effect. Our theory is based on
the idea that the true values of options are only imperfectly signaled by their observable
attributes, and thus people must draw upon all available cues to form evaluations. If the
target and decoy are believed to have been generated by the same underlying process, the
decoy can provide a negative signal about the value of the target. We constructed a hierar-
chical Bayesian model to formalize this pattern of reasoning. Our model embodies a point
made by Simonson (2014): “a finding that a moldy orange taints an adjacent (yet non-
moldy) orange and generates repulsion suggests that certain inferior options infect similar
options that are susceptible to the same affliction; in contrast, an overpriced, unattractive
sweater has no bearing on the quality of a more attractive sweater and merely highlights its
superior value. It thus seems that the nature of the relationship between the two adjacent
options is one moderator of the resulting effect.”
Past efforts to formally model the repulsion effect have been restricted to sequential
sampling models that lay out the dynamic process of decision making, and have struggled
to naturally capture the effect (Spektor et al. 2021, 2022). Our normative approach offers a
complementary perspective that casts light from a different angle. In the foundational tax-
onomy of David Marr (1982) from cognitive science, sequential sampling models reside on
the “algorithmic” level which emphasizes the process by which a computation is achieved,
while ours resides on the “computational” level which foregrounds the adaptive logic of
the computation and abstracts away from the algorithm. No formal computational-level
theory has been proposed before to explain the repulsion effect. Our goal was to fill this gap
by developing such a theory and demonstrating its explanatory power. This perspective
lets us view the problem in a way that brings clarity to many aspects. It obscures other
aspects by necessity, especially factors in the decision process such as presentation format
and timing (Cataldo and Cohen 2019, 2021a,b), because computational-level accounts are
inherently less suited for these than algorithmic ones.
The Bayesian framework nonetheless lets us flexibly encode many kinds of beliefs by
altering priors and likelihoods at various levels of the hierarchy. This affords us a great
deal of theoretical power, and allows exploration into the common and distinct properties
of decision making across different markets, or across economic and perceptual domains.
We made several simplifying assumptions to keep our exposition clean, and mentioned a
few ways they could be profitably relaxed. Even more extensions may be possible.
We focused on the repulsion effect for theoretical clarity and to avoid retreading 40
years of historical debate over the attraction effect (Huber et al. 2014). The mechanism
we propose is compatible with other sources of context effects. Nonetheless, we hope that
our theory can contribute to this dialogue by helping to identify conditions under which
the attraction effect may be opposed. Several have argued that ordinal information plays
a key role in attraction (Howes et al. 2016, Natenzon 2019) and that imprecise attribute
representations can diminish it by obscuring the dominance relationship (e.g., Huber et al.
2014, Simonson 2014, Spektor et al. 2021). This can explain why attraction tends to be
observed when attributes are concrete and bear little ambiguity, such as price (Simonson
2014). However, it has not been recognized that imprecision could also play a central role
in the repulsion effect.
Furthermore, rather than drawing lines between qualitative and quantitative stimuli
(Frederick et al. 2014, Yang and Lynn 2014) or between perceptual and preferential stimuli
(Spektor et al. 2018), our theory views them all through the common lens of inference and
distinguishes attributes based on inferential uncertainty (Spektor et al. 2021). Although
certain classes of attributes might be generally considered more precise (e.g., numeric
versus verbal descriptions), variation can still exist within these classes. For instance, some
attributes may be quantitative and yet imprecise, such as abstract quality ratings that are
hard to interpret; others may be qualitative and yet precise, such as clear and detailed
verbal or visual depictions. Much remains to be understood about how attribute perception
depends on the format of presentation.
The existence of other Bayesian models of context effects suggests that core aspects of
these effects may be reconciled through common mechanisms. By virtue of the Bayesian
framework, our model could in principle be combined with others into a mega-model that
includes multiple kinds of uncertainty and makes predictions about what will happen when
all forces are considered in sum. We provide simulations in the Appendix of such a model
that generates both the attraction and repulsion effects under different parameter settings.
This integration highlights the care needed when specifying the role of imprecise preferences
in context effects. Inference due to uncertainty in the relative value of attributes fosters
the attraction effect (Wernerfelt 1995, Shenoy and Yu 2013), whereas inference due to
uncertainty in overall integrated value fosters repulsion. It is thus insufficient to merely
allude to preference uncertainty in a generic sense; we must be precise about imprecision.
Although a full account of context dependence will surely need to incorporate multiple
cognitive mechanisms, we believe the elements we have laid out here sharpen our conception
of the repulsion effect and constitute a valuable piece of the puzzle.
Appendix A: Proofs
A.1. Proof of Proposition 1
The agent’s posterior belief about the target’s underlying value, given the target and decoy attributes, is
P (v |x , x ). This can be obtained by calculating the marginal distribution of P (v |x , x , v˜ ) which is

of the target and decoy value signals. That is, it is a convex combination of the individual item expectation
and the pooled group expectation. Algebra reveals that

As vˆ = ω x + ω x , the expression in Proposition 1 obtains. The decoy is inferior to the target, meaning

Let g represent the number of groups, equaling 1 when the target and decoy are from the same group and 2
when they are from different groups. Then

The posterior belief when the decoy is present is also more precise. Greater precision could increase utility for risk
averse agents, as Roberts and Urban (1988) and Erdem (1998) point out in the context of product branding. While
this may be a meaningful factor especially in economic decisions, it would oppose the reduction in mean value we
focus on above (leading to attraction), and thus cannot produce a repulsion effect.
The resulting expression resembles equation (A.4), with only the emergence of a multiplier on the repulsion
term scaling it by the probability that the target and decoy are thought to be from the same group. This
probability can be computed from Bayes’ rule, considering the relative probabilities that the two items came
from the same generative process or two different ones. To yield an analytically tractable result, like Kemp
et al. (2005) we approximate the likelihoods with the maximum a posteriori (MAP) values of the group-level

As the decoy distance increases, the posterior probabilities of these groups shift, which can reduce the
influence of the decoy.
just with different parameters. High noise relative to dispersion is required for repulsion (and hence the
U-shape), while uncertainty over ω is needed for attraction (and hence the inverse U-shape). The parameters
for each simulation are listed below.
