Part I – Case Presentation
My goal in this thesis is to understand Scrupulosity—obsessive or compulsive
symptoms relating to religion or morality—and the best way to understand it is to
compare and contrast other conditions and similarly atypical behaviors then look at
statistics. That way we get particular stories and general trends.
Part I compares three individuals with distinct personalities, motivations, and
behaviors. One has diagnosable psychopathy, one we might call a Saint, and one suffers
from Scrupulosity. Two have mental illnesses, two display admirable behavior, and all
three deviate from statistical norms. All three hurt people, albeit to different degrees and
with different motivations and intentions. Our society draws strong distinctions
between Sinners, Saints, and the mentally ill. However, there are similarities as well as
differences. They have distinct personalities, but they nevertheless overlap in
illuminating ways.
Part II examines the statistics. We conducted a small number of studies to better
understand the presentation of Scrupulosity in non-clinical samples. Such studies
included a revision of the current inventory used to score the severity of scrupulous
symptoms, known as the PIOS-R. Additionally, we looked at various convergent and
discriminate validity.
This project aligns with the ethos of Science and Society because Scrupulosity is a
condition that presents with specifically moral obsessions and compulsion. As a result,
the project promotes dialogue about morality and moral responsibility. For example, is
someone who is compelled to conduct moral actions more morally upright than
someone who is not compelled by a mental illness? Those who experience Scrupulosity
are motivated by anxiety, but does that motivation take away from the altruism or
“rightness” of their moral action?
Ted Bundy – Sinner
Salt Lake City, Utah November 08, 1974: Eighteen-year-old Carol DaRonch
browsed the local mall’s bookstore when a handsome man approached her looking
concerned. He identified himself as a police officer, Officer Roseland, looking for the
owner of a parked car. The handsome officer explained that there had been a break in,
and he wanted her to file a report. DaRonch was immediately wary of this police officer,
despite his congenial manner and identification badge, he smelled strongly of alcohol
and wore civilian clothes. DaRonch followed the officer out to her car. She explained
that nothing was missing, and her car didn’t have any damage, but the officer insisted
she come to the station to file a complaint. She reluctantly agreed (Berlinger 2016).
The supposed officer drove Carol in his light-brown Volkswagen Beetle, not to
the police station but an isolated stretch of road and pulled over. As the car slowed, the
officer attempted to handcuff Carol, but she successfully fought him off—fought him, as
though her life depended on it. After failing to cuff both hands, the man pulled out a
gun and threatened to shoot. In spite of her fear, DaRonch continued to fight. The man
then assaulted her with a crowbar, and DaRonch just barely escaped. It wasn’t until
years later that DaRonch realized she had narrowly escaped from one of history’s most
notorious serial killers, Ted Bundy (Berlinger 2016).
Ted Bundy had a mental disorder defined in Dominance and Aggression in Humans
and Other Animals as a defect “in which an individual manifests amoral and antisocial
behavior, shows a lack of ability to love or establish meaningful personal relationships,
expresses extreme egocentricity, and demonstrates a failure to learn from experience and
other behaviors associated with the condition.”(Hermann 2017) To classify someone as a
psychopath, they must score 30 or above on the PCL-R, the psychopathy checklist
developed and revised by Robert Hare.
The PCL-R is administered through an interview process, conducted by a
professional with specialized training so to properly assess someone’s psychopathic
traits. Thru this chapter, I will point out elements of this scale that Bundy demonstrated
throughout his life. For example, he displayed the psychopathic traits of conning and
manipulation when he convinced DaRonch to follow him to the parking lot.
Bundy was born November 24th, 1946, in Burlington, Vermont (Ramsland 2013).
Four years after giving birth to Bundy his mother, Louise, moved with her son to
Tacoma Washington (Ramsland 2013). Bundy described his childhood as idyllic with
involved and loving parents (Ramsland 2013). Based on Bundy’s retelling, his adolescent
years were unremarkable; however, as a juvenile he was arrested at least twice for
suspected burglary and auto-theft (Rule 1989). Much of what is known about Bundy’s
childhood is self-report, and since he is a known pathological liar, he proves an
unreliable narrator. Even while on death row, Bundy continued to give different
answers to different interviewers when asked the same questions (Aynesworth 1989).
Pathological lying and juvenile delinquency are two more recognized symptoms of
psychopathy exhibited by Bundy.
Based on contemporaneous reports, following high school graduation in 1965,
Bundy attended the University of Puget Sound, but soon transferred to University of
Washington in 1966 (Rule 1989). Immature and lacking focus, Bundy dropped out of
college and worked odd jobs for the rest of the decade (Rule 1989). He later re-enrolled,
earning his degree in psychology in 1972 (Michaud and Aynesworth 1999). Perhaps at
this time Bundy was just trying to find his way in life; however, lack of realistic long-
term goals is also a sign of psychopathy.
Before re-enrolling, Bundy met a young woman at a bar in 1969. Her name was
Elizabeth Klopfer. Bundy and Klopfer would date for five years and have continuing
contact for years after that. Their relationship continued sporadically well into the late
1970’s, despite Bundy’s incarceration (Rule 1989).
When Bundy and Klopfer began their relationship, Klopfer was a single mother.
Soon, consistent with a psychopath’s predilection for parasitic lifestyle, Klopfer was
financially supporting herself, her daughter, and Bundy (Hare 1995) (Ramsland 2013).
Klopfer described her experience dating Ted Bundy in her book The Phantom Prince
(Ramsland 2013). She described how he would convince her that she was to blame
whenever she caught his lies (Kendall 2020). When women began to go missing in the
Pacific Northwest, Klopfer periodically suspected Bundy (Kendall 2020).
Two weeks before abductions of two young women occurred at Lake
Sammamish, Bundy and Klopfer spent a day on the lake (Kendall 2020). During the
outing, Bundy pushed Klopfer off of their raft and watched her struggle, never making a
move to help her back into the boat (Ramsland 2013). With this act, Bundy demonstrated
callousness and lack of empathy, another trait of psychopathy. Klopfer later revealed
that she reported Bundy to the police after the women went missing at Lake
Sammamish (Kendall 2020).
Wherever Bundy went, he left a trail of murdered women in his wake. While
there is no clear consensus as to when Bundy’s murderous acts began, we know that by
1971 he had begun killing in Seattle (Keppel 1995). Bundy reported that within three
years he was skilled enough to evade suspicion and avoid leaving forensic evidence at
crimes scenes.(Michaud et al. 1989) He used props to lure women, such as crutches, an
arm sling, or a cast, pleading for their help to carry a heavy briefcase or a large stack of
books(Keppel 1995; Michaud et al. 1989; Rule 1989). His tactics, like those he used
against DaRonch were of conning and manipulation, another component of the PCL-R.
In 1974, young attractive women with long hair and a part down the middle
started to go missing from Seattle at a rate of about one every month (Rule 1989). It was
during this series of killings, that Bundy worked as a counselor at the Seattle Crisis
Clinic (Rule 1989). Reportedly he excelled at his work (Rule 1989). According to Ann
Rule, crisis clinic coworker and later author of The Stranger Beside Me, Bundy was patient
and considerate when helping someone through a crisis (Rule 1989).
However, another coworker of Bundy, contradicts Rule’s retelling, saying that
Bundy was never anything but short, cold, and sometimes ruthless with distressed
callers (Ramsland 2013). The murders peaked that summer of 1974 with the abduction of
two women from Lake Sammamish in broad daylight (AP 1974). Bundy’s audacity
provided police the first full physical description of the man who was terrorizing
Seattle’s women. Klopfer, Rule, one of his professors, and a previous coworker from the
Department of Emergency Services phoned in tips to the police hotline (Rule 1989).
Within the next few months, Bundy left Washington to attend law school in Utah. There,
too, women began to go missing.
Once in Utah, Bundy attempted to kidnap Carol DaRonch. When he failed,
Bundy flew into a fit of rage, abducting and killing Debby Kent only a few hours later
(Ramsland 2013). DaRonch’s miraculous escape ultimately lead to Bundy’s downfall
(Ramsland 2013). She was able to identify Bundy from a line up after he was arrested for
a traffic violation in 1975 (Ramsland 2013). He was put on trial, found guilty, and
sentenced to one-to-fifteen years in prison.
Following conviction, Bundy was moved to a jail in Colorado to face separate
murder charges in that state (Ramsland 2013). While he was held in Colorado, Bundy
escaped by jumping out of the courthouse window (Rule 1989). However, he was
recaptured after turning himself in, explaining that he got cold in the Colorado
mountains (Ramsland 2013). Revocation of conditional release, including escaping from
prison, is also listed as an item on the PCL-R.
The jail didn’t hold Bundy for long though, for he soon escaped again and fled to
Tallahassee, Florida (Ramsland 2013). Within a month he attacked five women in a
sorority house, killing two and severely injuring others (Michaud et al. 1989). Bundy had
lost control (Rule 1989).
Once again, Bundy’s undoing was a traffic violation that lead to his arrest. Once
identified, he was put on trial for murder in Florida. Despite the advice of his council,
Bundy refused to consider the insanity defense. In a sign of either hubris or ignorance,
again consistent with a diagnosis of psychopathy, Bundy fired his legal team and elected
to defend himself (Hare 1995)(Ramsland 2013).
Bundy’s conceit proved fatal. Prior to firing his legal team, the counsel had made
a plea bargain with the judge. Since the legal team had already secured a plea bargain,
Bundy had signed an admission of guilt. He threw away the plea when he demanded
that he be allowed to defend himself. The prosecution then had Bundy’s signed
confession to show the jury, but Bundy no longer had protection from the electric chair.
As a result of acting as his own (incompetent) defense counsel, Bundy was found
guilty for two counts of murder and sentenced to death (Michaud et al. 1989). Bundy’s
demand to act as his own lawyer demonstrates both grandiose sense of self and need for
stimulation. Bundy wanted to have freedoms not afforded to other inmates, such as
access to library books and better lighting.
While on death-row, Bundy enlisted author Stephen Michaud to write a
biography of his life. After hours of conversations, Michaud described Bundy as turning
“interviews into a game of chutes and ladders, with disingenuous pleas of faulty
memory and long silences preventing me from pinning him down.”(Michaud et al. 1989)
Michaud found Bundy simultaneously fascinating and repulsive (Michaud et al. 1989).
One could never tell how truthful Bundy was, but one could always assume that he had
ulterior motives (Michaud et al. 1989).
In his final interview before execution Bundy spoke with evangelical leader
Reverend James Dobson (Ramsland 2013). Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family
(FOTF)—a fundamentalist Christian organization which promotes social conservative
values in public policy, such as restriction of abortion and abstinence-only sex
education(“Foundational Values” n.d.)—was also a public opponent of pornography
(Max Blumenthal 2009). Dobson’s interview with Ted Bundy made over a million
dollars in revenue for FOTF. Sixty percent of the proceeds were donated to anti-
pornography and anti-abortion political groups (Max Blumenthal 2009).
During the interview, Bundy blamed pornography for his digression into a serial
rapist and murderer (Ramsland 2013). He claimed that pornography was addictive,
explaining, “you keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of
material. Like an addiction, you keep craving something which is harder, harder,
something which… gives you a greater sense of excitement, until you reach the point
where the pornography only goes so far, you reach that jumping off point where you
begin to wonder if… if maybe actually doing it will give you that which is just beyond
reading about it and looking at it.”(Bundy 1989)
Bundy accurately describes symptoms of addiction, but his conclusion, that
pornography was his gateway into (and cause of) serial rape and murder, is
indefensible. An addiction to pornography has not borne out as an indicator of violent
sexual behaviors or criminal acts. Dr. Emanuel Tanay, a Detroit psychiatrist who
interviewed Bundy, explains that “pornography does not have the power to cause the
severe deformity of personality that he had.” (Beasley 1989) Tanay went further to say
that Bundy’s preference for violent pornography was not the cause of his behavior, “but
rather a reflection of his demented personality.” (Beasley 1989)
Another expert psychologist, Jim Breiling of the National Institute of Mental
Health, Anti-social and Violent Behavior Branch, explains that “After-the-fact
explanations often become justifications. It is sort of like removing
responsibility”(Beasley 1989). Breiling describes Bundy’s preference for violent
pornography akin to an avid camper’s attraction to outdoor magazines, the attraction to
the images is secondary to the primary interest (Beasley 1989). Fitting the profile of a
clinical psychopath, Bundy deflected responsibility, suggesting that any son, father, or
brother could become a serial killer under the influence of violent pornography. He
claimed that despite his “very strong inhibitions against criminal and violent behavior”
even he fell victim to the evils of pornography (Hare 1995; Bundy 1989).
Bundy shamelessly shifted blame: yet another marker of psychopathy. He
claimed that advertisements on stolen TV’s brainwashed him into stealing more items,
such as credit cards. He blamed some of his victims.(Rule 1989) On at least one occasion,
he even tried to blame the woman he murdered in a letter he wrote to Klopfer "I have
known people who ... radiate vulnerability…. Their facial expressions say, 'I am afraid of
you.' These people invite abuse. By expecting to be hurt, do they subtly encourage
it?”(Kendall 2020) The answer to Bundy’s question is obviously no.
Bundy blamed pornography, vulnerable women, and then also compulsions. He
said that his murderous impulses were a “building up of this destructive
energy…”(Bundy 1989)—for a while he was satisfied with violent pornography, but his
obsession took over his volition. He attempted to describe his compulsion to Dobson,
laughing before he continued in halted speech, “there is absolutely no way to describe.
First the brutal urge to do that kind of thing and then what happens is once it is more or
less satisfied, and, receded you might say, or spent, like that sense, that kind of energy at
a level receded and basically I became myself again.”(Bundy 1989) Bundy would blame
anyone but himself, and this refusal to accept responsibility is typical of psychopaths.
Another indicator of psychopathy is criminal versatility. Bundy’s crimes were
not only that of sexual sadism; he also committed murder, larceny, impersonation of a
police officer, assault of a police officer. . . the list goes on. This variety of crimes well
qualifies Bundy for the designation of criminally versatile, another item on the PCL-R.
This brief recounting of Bundy’s life is enough to show that he was, indeed, a
psychopath. Bundy meets almost all of the PCL-R requirements for psychopathy, (Hare
1995) because he was manipulative, had a grandiose self-image and superficial charm,
denied his responsibility, lived a parasitic lifestyle, and lacked any ability to experience
empathy, love, or care for the pain and suffering of others in addition to his juvenile
delinquency, criminal versatility, and escapes from jail. Even more, he was a sexual
sadist and serial killer with a psychopathic personality disorder. For all of these reasons,
Bundy is also a sinner, because he performed actions for his own self-interest, and he
intentionally and willfully hurt and killed many others without remorse.
Paul Farmer – Saint
A Saint leads a life worthy of emulation. Saints are good people despite
circumstances, and willingly sacrifice for the good of others, a sacrifice motivated by
moral reasons (J. S. Summers and W. Sinnott-Armstrong 2019). Paul Farmer is a Saint in
this way, because he accepts hardship in his own life in order to improve others. He
accepts greater responsibilities and a greater sense of duty not only to his friends and
family, but also to people whom he does not personally know or who live far from him.
Farmer says that he feels the most alive when helping people (Kidder 2009).
Farmer was born October 26th, 1959 and grew up in several places across the US.
He attended Duke University as an undergraduate and then Harvard Medical School.
He is known for his accomplishments in global medicine. The organization he founded,
Partners in Health (PIH) treated multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in
Kazakhstan and Peru, developed hospitals and health centers across Haiti, treated HIV
patients in Lesotho, treated Ebola in Liberia, and fought (and continues to fight) disease
in many more ways. Tracy Kidder’s book Mountains Beyond Mountains recounts several
years of Farmer’s work fighting TB and multiple drug resistant-TB (MBR-TB) primarily
in Haiti, Peru and Russia (Kidder 2009).
When asked how he feels when he is called a Saint, Farmer says that he feels like
the thief in Hawthorne’s novel The Marble Faun (Kidder 2009). In that story, a thief steals
from the Catholic Church and while making an exit anoints himself with Holy Water
and the Sign of the Cross. Farmer protested the title saying, “people call me a Saint and I
think, I have to work harder. Because a Saint would be a great thing to be.” (Kidder
2009)
Kidder wrote that, when he asked Famer about his Sainthood, he “felt a small
inner disturbance. It wasn’t that the words seemed immodest. I felt I was in the presence
of a different person from the one I’d been chatting with a moment ago, someone whose
ambitions I hadn’t yet begun to fathom.”(Kidder 2009) This exchange highlights a key
feature of Sainthood, humility. In order to be a Saint, one must not claim to be a Saint or
else one’s motivations would be revealed as aspirations for notoriety.
Farmer does not always meet common standards of virtue. He has a loose
interpretation of laws that he finds obstructive to a higher moral code. For example,
Farmer and his partner Jim Kim stole drugs and microscopes from Harvard Brigham
hospital in order to provide poor Haitians with medical services (Kidder 2009). Farmer
contended that it was his moral obligation to provide Haitians with the same quality of
health care as Americans. He seemed to take only slight consideration of the means he
employed to accomplish this goal and focused more on the outcome, treating the sick
and injured of a third-world country (Kidder 2009). True, he stole. However, he stole
from excess and to give to those who had none. That being said…he did steal drugs.
Farmer follows his own moral code, a trait characteristic of many Saints. Cultural
heroes, people who changed the world, typically did not follow the letter of the law.
They were morally upstanding people, but they broke laws to incite change or to save
lives. Those such as Martin Luther King Jr., Ghandi, and Nelson Mandela were heroes,
but also rebels: Leaders of revolutions answer for the well-being of a people, which is a
higher calling then a penal code.
While Farmer is a Saint in actions and achievements, his Sainthood comes at a
cost to himself as well as others, especially those closest to him. Kidder wrote of the
personal and relational costs of Farmer’s Saintliness, specifically with his longtime
partner Ophelia Dahl (who could also be considered a Saint, albeit one of a very
different style). Farmer once proposed to Ophelia. In her rejection, she wrote, “the
qualities I love in you also cause me to resent you: namely your unswerving
commitment to the poor, your limitless schedule and your massive compassion for
others. [A]s your wife, I would place my own emotional needs in the way of your
important vision.”(Kidder 2009)
Years later, Dahl reflected that Farmer “…made so many people feel he cared
about only them at that moment.”(Kidder 2009) Dahl continued, “Of course, one knew
that sometimes his interest was mixed with other motives, but he had this power
because somehow one also knew that his interest was sincere.”(Kidder 2009) Her
recollections show Farmer’s authentic interests in others’ well-being, but she also hints
at his fallibility. Even though his “interest was sincere,” his motivations were
complicated (Kidder 2009). Farmer’s commitment to the poor stressed not only his
romantic relationships but also his other personal relationships:
Some months after [Farmer’s non-profit] received the Gates grant, Farmer wrote
an open letter to the organization. In it, he worried that PIH might be losing its
way ‘morally.’ This because, among other things, some employees expected to be
paid for working extra hours. He wrote, ‘One can never work overtime for the
poor. We’re only scrambling to make up for our deficiencies.’ (Kidder 2009 pp
245)
Dahl had to clean up the resulting emotional breakdown after Famer returned to
Haiti. Among other things, Dahl ensured that their workers would be paid for their
overtime. She did not bother to tell Farmer.
Farmer’s standards were unsustainable. He held unrealistic standards for others,
in large part because he had even more unrealistic standards for himself. Whatever
Farmer asked of others, he demanded from himself ten-fold. However, Farmer’s ability
to function and even thrive under extreme conditions in Haiti along with his other forms
of rigorous self-denial could not be matched by other workers in PIH, leading many of
them to have mental breakdowns. Ophelia explained that Farmer wasn’t cruel, but his
expectations exceeded what others could offer. Ophelia admitted that volunteers wept
in “a case of nervous exhaustion, a case of… ‘decompressing from Paul.’”(Kidder 2009)
During his years traveling with Farmer, Kidder felt "sorry that so many Haitian
children still died of measles …” but he also felt sorry that he could never be sorry
enough to satisfy Farmer.”(Kidder 2009) Perhaps Farmer inspired the best in others, he
pushed them to offer the most of themselves, and maximized positive outcomes. But he
also left a wake of well-intentioned people with the belief they would never be able to
meet his expectations.
There is a level of cruelty in this kind of Saint—a cruelty, albeit unintentional,
directed at those whom the Saint should be closest to, including parents, children, and
romantic partners. Farmer clearly believes that we have a moral obligation to strangers.
He was quoted as saying, “Some things were plenty black and white … areas of moral
clarity, which they called AMC’s” and one of those things is sacrificing for the poor
(Kidder 2009).
Author Larissa MacFarquhar writes in Strangers Drowning that “without selfish
partiality—to people you are deeply attached to, your family and friends, to place—we
are nothing. We are creatures of kinship and loyalty, not blind servants of the
world.”(MacFarquhar 2015) It is pragmatic to have a primary duty to family, then to
those who are close, and finally to more distant persons. Preferring one’s own kin is a
social expectation, so neglecting one’s kin leads to personal injury of them. Farmer
strived to love strangers with the same strength as his own children:
I thought I was the king of empathy for these poor kids, but if I was the king of
empathy, why this big shift because of my daughter? It was a failure of empathy,
the inability to love other children as much as yours. The thing is, everybody
understands that, encourages that, praises you for it. But the hard thing is the
other [loving them all equally].… All the great religious traditions of the world
say, Love thy neighbor as thyself. My answer is, I’m sorry, I can’t, but I’m gonna
[sic] keep on trying.(Kidder 2009 pp 213)
Farmer sees his devotion to his daughter as a weakness. But consider the Saint
who abandons his own children for the sake of others’ children. By this social contract,
this Saint is then a Sinner, regardless of what “good” he bestows on those beyond his
kin.
MacFarquhar writes that “many people genuinely do not wish to be Saints, and
it is probable that some who achieve or aspire to Sainthood have never felt much
temptation to be human beings.”(MacFarquhar 2015) This is true; consider a Saint who
believes that a distant child means as much to him as the child who is near and is his.
Anyone who believes this ignores the impact of both biological and psychological social
bonding. For a Saint not to prefer his kin is to neglect his kin. Farmer is a Saint, but this
does not prevent him from hurting others, especially those closest to him.
Comparing the Saint and the Sinner
The Saint and the Sinner represent two ends of a spectrum. They are physical
manifestations of an endless battle between good and evil. Saints and Sinners have taken
different forms throughout history and folklore: the heroes and villains of fairy tales,
Paul the Apostle and Judas Iscariot in Christianity, Malachi and Mordechai in Jewish
tradition, etc. The two greatest contrasts described so far is the Saint Farmer and the
Sinner Bundy.
As a Saint, Farmer makes his own life harder in order to better the lives of others,
adopting greater responsibility and an increased sense of duty. In contrast, the Sinner,
Bundy, acts on selfish whims. The differences between Bundy and Farmer are more
evident than their similarities, but their similarities are still both surprising and
illuminating.
One similarity is that Saints still cause collateral damage. We saw how Farmer
hurt the feelings of those who cared for him because his expectations were too high for
his friends to satisfy. In addition, his self-preservation instincts were not well-tuned to
risk also causing his friends distress. As portrayed in another anecdote recounted by
Kidder:
Jim Kim said to Paul, “You’re no use to anyone as a martyr.” He tried to soften
his tone. “If you get yourself killed, Paul, I’m going to kill you.” Paul’s face
turned bright red. “What the fuck do you want me to do!” Paul had yelled at him
before, but Jim had never heard him scream. Paul smuggled the money into Haiti
(Kidder 2009 pp 115).
Jim Kim was right; Farmer is no use to anyone as a martyr. Farmer may have
thought his safety unimportant when working to better the lives of others, but he seems
to fail to comprehend the pain he caused Kim with his recklessness.
These tendencies arise in part because Farmer views all people, regardless of
status as friend or family, as equal. Saints view all persons as special and, hence, as
essentially equal. As Farmer put it, “’if you say that seven hours is too long to walk for
two families of patients, you’re saying that their lives matter less than some others’, and
the idea that some lives matter less is the root of all that’s wrong with the
world.”(Kidder 2009) Similarly, psychopaths and other sinners also seem to view all
other people as essentially the same, but only because they see themselves as the only
special ones and all other people as fundamentally below them. Although they have
very different views of their own importance, Saints and Sinners, thus, seem comparable
insofar as they both treat all others as equal.
As a result, they both misunderstood other people. Bundy underestimated
compassion. He underestimated human love for those who went missing. In
Conversations with a Killer, Bundy demonstrates both his obliviousness to the value of
life, and his habit of holding unrealistic expectations of others:
[Bundy] had taken this somewhat unrealistic conclusion that under the correct
circumstances, he could select any person as a victim. And that there would be
virtually no attention paid to that person’s disappearance. Because people
disappear every day! It happens all the time. . . he was always amazed and
chagrined by the publicity generated by the disappearances he thought would go
almost totally unnoticed. Of course, this was an unrealistic expectation… for
some reason, it was a necessary way of looking at things. To say that perhaps this
person won’t be missed. I mean, there are so many people. This person will
never be missed. It shouldn’t be a problem (Michaud et al. 1989, transcript).
Farmer’s misunderstanding was in the opposite direction. Farmer overestimated
peoples’ capabilities of self-sacrifice and sustainability for charity and self-denial. He
expected those who volunteer with him to make sacrifices for the poor that were
unsustainable for their capabilities. Even though Bundy underestimated others and
Farmer overestimated others, they both misunderstood others by assuming that others
shared their views.
My Saint and Sinner are also similar in how different parts of their minds fit
together. Both Farmer and Bundy act in ways that mesh with their wants and desires.
Bundy wanted sexual gratification, and Farmer wants to save lives. Neither Bundy nor
Farmer seems to experience the inner turmoil of conflict within their personalities. In a
way, this frees Farmer and Bundy from symptoms of guilt and regret. Unlike Farmer,
Bundy did not choose to sacrifice in order to help others, he chose self-gratification. The
way Bundy choose to self-gratify was truly horrific. Farmer knows he helps the poor
more than the average person, but this does not seem to mitigate his sense of his or their
duties. Bundy knew that it was wrong to rape and murder, but that did not seem to
mitigate his raping and murdering behaviors.
Despite these similarities, my Saint and Sinner still obviously differ greatly in the
degree or amount of harm they caused. The harm that Bundy enacted was far more
severe than anything Farmer could ever imagine doing. Bundy raped and murdered
women, and he did not seem to appreciate the harm he caused with his actions. His acts
overshadow any semblance of harm which might have been caused by Farmer.
The harm that Farmed caused was also incidental, at worst a product of
negligence. His harm was never intentional, and it occurred as consequence of his
charitable interests. In contrast, Bundy’s desired outcome required causing harm. It
required murder. Bundy’s intent was explicitly to kill. No greater harm can happen to a
person’s body but to be killed. Bundy was motivated by self-interest and driven to
achieve an outcome that left women dead.
Finally, while Bundy sought his own self-interest, Farmer sacrificed his. His
work for others often led to injuries and illness for Farmer. At one point, he broke his
leg. At another time, he continued to fly back and forth between Haiti and Boston after
becoming infected with Hepatitis C (Kidder 2009). He continued to work for as long as
possible until it was impossible for him to continue. This kind of extreme self-denial
connects the Saint and the Scrupulous, not a Saint and a Sinner.
Jennifer Traig – The Scrupulous
Jenny Traig, author of Devil in the Details, provides insight into the mental illness
of Scrupulosity. Scrupulosity is “a disorder characterized by obsessions and
compulsions that are moral in nature.”(“IOCDF-Scrupulosity-Fact-Sheet.Pdf” n.d.) It is a
disorder characterized by morally relevant thought distortions, or obsessions, which
compel the individual to soothe their anxiety by certain actions, or compulsions. For
Jenny, Scrupulosity
Made even regular museums agony. I had decided not to look at any paintings of
people; they were graven images, and If I was going to do that I might as well go
ahead and build a golden calf. Worse still were the religious paintings, idols all.
My parents had seen this coming and had warned me not to try anything funny.
“If we pay eight dollars to get you into a museum you’re daman well going to
look at everything they have there,” they insisted. I placated them by pretending
to look at the artwork; I was actually just looking at the frames. (Traig, 2004 pp
200)
Traig’s experience with mental illness is a good foil to the obsessions and
compulsions which Bundy claimed to motivate him. Her obsessions and compulsions
were also about morality, but in the opposite direction. Traig was born in the early
70’s—coincidentally at the height of Bundy’s murderous rampage—and was raised in
California. Her memoir recounts her childhood in the 1980’s with a Catholic mother and
a Jewish father—a mixing of cultures and religions to which Traig attributes some of her
neurosis. Traig opens her memoir with the admission of suffering from Scrupulosity.
Traig accuses neuroanatomical and physiological abnormalities in the basal ganglia, a
region of deep in the center of the brain for the symptoms she experienced. She laments
that “Because one’s immortal soul—Jewish or Christian—is on the line, Scrupulosity can
be one of the hardest forms of OCD to treat.... Oddly, religion is often what helps the
sufferer get over it.”(Traig 2004)
Scrupulosity is easier to understand in relation to Obsessive Compulsive
Disorder (OCD). The official psychiatric handbook of mental diseases or the Diagnostic
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) lists the trait “scrupulous” as one of the
possible symptoms for OCPD, or obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. The term
arises as a possible diagnostic criterion for OCPD if the patient presents as, “over-
conscientious, Scrupulous or inflexible about matters of morality, ethics or values (not
accounted for by cultural or religious identification).”(APA 2013)
In other words, being scrupulous (in the lower-case form of the word) alone does
not qualify as a mental disorder. Scrupulosity, the upper-case proper noun, does not
currently pick out its own diagnostic category in the DSM-5. Instead, it is currently
understood as a form of OCD (J. S. Summers and W. Sinnott-Armstrong 2019). For
someone to meet criteria for OCD they must exhibit “true obsessions and
compulsions”(APA 2013).
Obsessions and compulsions are defined in detail by the DSM-5 under the
diagnosis of OCD (see below). Briefly, obsessions are recurrent and persistent thoughts
which an individual cannot ignore or suppress. Compulsions are acts performed by
someone suffering from an obsession in order to neutralize the intrusive thought.
Compulsions are usually repetitive behaviors such as ordering, checking, or mental acts
(e.g., praying)(APA 2013).

For a thought to be an obsession, the individual’s thoughts, urges, or images
must be recurrent and persistent, intrusive and unwanted, and evoke distress or anxiety.
In Clean Hands? Summers and Sinnott-Armstrong argue that the anxiety-inducing
thoughts must also be disproportionate to the actual and reasonable risk: “the anxiety
must not be a proportionate response to a reasonable and accurate assessment of a
danger, threat, or genuine potential for losses.” (J. S. Summers and W. Sinnott-
Armstrong 2019)
Anxiety coincides with the intrusive and obsessive thought. First, because the
individual suffers an overestimation of the likelihood or degree of harm. Second,
because anxiety has been conditioned to accompany the thought. Specifically, the
individual develops a heightened and disproportionate awareness and aversion to
certain risks, such that the individual exhibits an exaggerated emotional response to a
condition. Finally, the individual with Scrupulosity has a preoccupation with the
thought, urge, or image. This preoccupation involves an inability to think about
anything else or to distract and to not ruminate (J. S. Summers and W. Sinnott-
Armstrong 2019). Traig recounts:
Perhaps our obsessions are entertaining enough. In real life we are meek and
law-abiding, but in our minds we are murderous sex fiends. Most obsessive-
compulsives fear they are going to stab a loved one. Many of us can’t bear to be
around knives at all. This fear isn’t all that irrational; knives are dangerous, and
goodness knows even loved ones can push it. Our other fears, however, make
less sense. Though we are neither pedophiles nor animal lovers, we fear that we
are going to rape the baby and the housecat (Traig 2004 pp 24).
Scrupulosity, like other forms of OCD, causes the sufferer distress. The disorder
enslaves people to a set of conditioned cues, thoughts, feelings, urges, and then
behaviors. While it may not make sense or even be possible to follow the command, the
internal urge, nevertheless, they must! This trait of the disorder engenders the distress
associated with Scrupulosity. Traig described a time of her life at the height of her
symptoms:
It drove everyone crazy, but I couldn't stop. Twenty or thirty times during the
course of a meal, I would hop out of my seat, spin around, smack the bookshelf
behind my chair, then spin back. It was not an activity I particularly enjoyed.
While I was spanking the furniture, my cereal was getting soggy, my sister was
eating my bacon, and my parents were expanding my vocabulary with a series of
increasingly profane threats. 'Sweet mother of crap, Jennifer. What did the
bookcase ever do to you? If you're going to smack anything, smack your sister.
She's the one who's eating all your bacon.'(Traig 2004 pp 25)
The other primary characteristic of OCD are compulsions. Obsessions create a
feedback loop within the brain of those with OCD, and compulsions respond to these
obsessions, for a time alleviating some of the anxiety associated with a thought.(Maia,
Cooney, and Peterson 2008) But the reduction in anxiety is temporary so the manner in
which to address the anxiety must change. This is how compulsions develop.
If Traig was worried about ritual cleanliness, she would wash her hands, but
then she might be concerned that she didn’t wash her hands completely enough, or with
the right kind of soap, or the towel was dirty, so the hand washing regime grows
progressively more elaborate as each piece of the ritual gradually becomes less effective
at soothing her anxiety. The patterns of behavior may develop to the point that the
thought which induced the initial anxiety, “I must be clean of impurities,” is no longer
discernable by the ritual. Traig self-describes her experience as:
The obsessive behavior quickly evolved from a casual hobby to an all-consuming
addiction, a full-time occupation. It happened so fast. One day I was riding bikes
to McDonald’s like a normal kid; the next, I was painting the lintels with
marinade to ward off the Angel of Death.… I don’t remember what came first,
but I think it was the food. At this point I’d been having problems with food in
an obsessive but secular way for about a year. I had begun eliminating foods
from my diet, first sugar and shortening, and then cooked foods, then food that
had been touched by human hands, then processed foods, and then unprocessed.
By January we were down to little more than dried fruit, and my nails were the
texture of string cheese (Traig 2004 pp 6).
Although, there are more complete definitions of mental disorders (and likely
better ones) for the purposes of this chapter, we will consider a condition a mental
illness based on four qualifiers a) causes disturbances in the daily life of someone with
the condition b) stems from dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or
developmental processes underlying mental functioning c) it is not explained by cultural
variances, and d) the dysfunction is not primarily between the individual and society.
The four points are adopted from the definition of mental disorder provided in the
DSM-5 (APA 2013).
Traig’s mental illness caused distress to both herself and her family. Traig was
distressed because she suffered disturbances in her daily life owing to her condition.
One day she was riding bikes like a normal kid; the next she was painting lintels to ward
off the Angle of death. Traig’s condition, Scrupulosity, stemmed from dysfunction in her
psychological processes. Traig’s thoughts were obsessional, which is a dysfunction of an
underlying mental process, and she performed compulsions, which were dysfunctional
responses to a psychological stressor.
Third, although Traig’s obsessions were predominately focused on Orthodox
Judaism, her thoughts and behaviors were not consistent with the practice of the
religion. Her behaviors exceeded behaviors of the most pious followers. Traig did not
receive accolades from the Rabbi, but mild disapproval; they shook their head at her
behaviors. She wore a Kleenex as a yarmulke even though women do not wear
yarmulkes. Finally, her dysfunction did not primarily lie between herself and society.
She would have felt anxious even if others had not disapproved of her actions.
All this together supports the claim that Scrupulosity is a mental illness as
exemplified by Traig’s experiences. While Scrupulosity is not listed in the DSM-5 as a
distinct mental illness, it does fall within the diagnostic category of OCD when
obsessions and compulsions are present, and it is distinct from other subtypes of OCD.
The sufferer with Scrupulosity has religious or moral obsessions and compulsions, but
these are still obsessions and compulsions related to anxiety and dysfunction.
Admittedly, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between the atypically
devout or moral and the pathologically devout or moral. Even Farmer noted that the
line between charity and obsession sometimes blurs. During a disagreement with
Kidder about Kidder’s tentative portrayal of Farmer’s work in Cuba he said, “When
others write about people who live on the edge, who challenge their comfortable lives—
and it has happened to me—they usually do it in a way that allows a reader a way out.
You could render generosity into pathology, commitment into obsession. That’s all in
the repertory of someone who wants to put the reader at ease rather than conveying the
truth in a compelling manner.”(Kidder 2009) Nevertheless, Farmer’s actions are
atypically good but not pathological, whereas Scrupulosity is a mental disorder.
The line between Scrupulosity and exceptional morality is marked by other
distinctive features of Scrupulosity. In particular, patients with Scrupulosity typically
display (1) perfectionism, (2) chronic doubt, and (3) moral thought-action fusion (Nelson
et al., 2006; cf. Frost & Steketee, 2002; Olatunji, Abramowitz, Williams, Connolly, & Lohr,
2007). (J. S. Summers and W. Sinnott-Armstrong 2019) Perfectionism (as is relevant to
Scrupulosity) is characterized as being:
…excessively conscientious, Scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of
morality, ethics, or values…[They] may force themselves and others to follow
rigid moral principles and very strict standards of performance. They may also
be mercilessly self-critical about their own mistakes. Individuals with this
disorder are rigidly deferential to authority and rules and insist on quite literal
compliance, with no rule bending for extenuating circumstances…. These
qualities should not be accounted for by the individual’s cultural or religious
identification. (American Psychological Association, “Obsessive-Compulsive and
Related Disorders.”)
Traig refused to look at museum paintings for fear that she might break a rule
regarding idolatry. She altered her diet to the point of starvation in an attempt to eat
Kosher, although she took liberties with rules by increasing their restrictiveness.
Second, chronic doubt affects those with Scrupulosity. Chronic doubt is
persistent doubt that bleeds into every part of life. There is no acceptance of “good
enough” because the Scrupulous cannot accept the uncertainty associated with chronic
doubt, the endless “what if’s”. They cannot accept that they have tried “enough” or
performed “good enough”; their anxiety compels them to check, and recheck, and
recheck their recheck (J. S. Summers and W. Sinnott-Armstrong 2019). Traig wrote that:
Scrupulosity is sometimes called the doubting disease, because it forces you to
question everything, Anything you do or say or wear or hear or eat or think, you
examine in excruciatingly minute detail. Will I go to hell if I watch HBO? Is it
sacrilegious to shop wholesale? What is the biblical position on organic produce?
One question leads directly to the next, like beads on a rosary, each doubt a pearl
to rub and worry. Foundation garments, beverages, reading material: for the
Scrupulous, no matter is too mundane for a dissertation-length theological
interrogation (Traig 2004 pp 5).
Third, moral thought-action fusion occurs when the Scrupulous cannot
distinguish between the harm caused by thinking of an action and the harmed caused by
performing an action. Summers and Sinnott-Armstrong write, “people with
Scrupulosity fail to distinguish doing something immoral from thinking about doing
something immoral and, hence, treat thoughts as equivalent (or close) in moral status to
physical actions.” (J. S. Summers and W. Sinnott-Armstrong 2019)
This symptom was present in Traig. She was concerned that any impure
thoughts were equivalent to impure actions. In her memoir Traig wrote, “Don’t think
about toilets. Don’t think about toilets. Don’t think about toilets. Oh, now you’re going
to have to go wash.”(Traig 2004) In this example, Traig’s thoughts about toilets blurred
into action. Even though Traig only thought about a toilet, she had to wash as though she
had actually used the toilet.
The Scrupulous are motivated by the anxiety associated with their obsessive
thoughts. Traig’s piety is amplified by her anxiety and by her mental illness. Her
obsessive thought was “Don’t think about toilets” and the co-occurring anxiety
compelled her to wash her hands. In the preface of the book Clean Hands?, Jesse
Summers writes that those with Scrupulosity, “might or might not act the same as
someone motivated by morality, but motivation by anxiety seems fundamentally
incompatible with motivation by morality.” (J. S. Summers and W. Sinnott-Armstrong
2019). Summers and Sinnott-Armstrong wrote, “We distinguish people with
Scrupulosity from people with admirable character traits who might perform the same
actions.... admirable character traits cannot be defined merely by behavior—and in some
cases, not even by a simple account of the person’s motivation.”( J. S. Summers and W.
Sinnott-Armstrong 2019)
Traig’s motivation for an internal relief, even one that may be related to morality,
is still a selfish one. Her goal is not positive, in that relief from anxiety does not add a
positive emotion, but rather diminishes negative feelings from doubt and anxiety. She
feels satisfaction only insofar as her anxiety is taken away. Thus, Traig suffers from
Scrupulosity and is neither a Saint nor a Sinner, because, even though her behaviors
match those of some Saints, her actions are inspired by anxiety and aimed to assuage
discomfort she feels rather than to fix a wrong external to herself.
Comparisons
A person may be indifferent, motivated, or obsessed with morality; rather, with
acting morally. The psychopath is indifferent, the Saint motivated, and the Scrupulous
obsessed. In lieu of morality, the psychopath is motived by his self-interest. For Bundy,
the combination of his motivation for self-gratification, his inability for empathy, and
lust for sexual sadism made a very dangerous person indeed. His actions were
horrifically immoral and performed to achieve his wants and desires without regard for
the harm to others.
In contrast, both the Saint and the Scrupulous perform morally, but only the
Saint is truly motivated by morality. The Scrupulous, in a fashion similar to a Sinner, is
motivated by self-interest, albeit one for an alleviation of anxiety as opposed to a desire
to kidnap, rape, murder, and so on so forth. The similarities among the three are less
obvious than their differences, but they still exist. Their similarities are that their actions
have collateral damage, but their differences are intent, motive, and degree of harm.

The Saint and The Scrupulous
The actions of the Saints and the Scrupulous actions appear comparable. The
distinction lies in their inspiration. A moral action performed because it is the right thing
to do is different from a moral action performed because it is the compulsive thing to do.
Discussed earlier was the classification of Scrupulosity as a mental disease. Sainthood,
on the other hand, is no mental illness.
Although some behaviors performed by the Saint might seem odd, the actions
are not pathological because their motivation stems from strong moral character. For
example, Paul Farmer continually put his life at risk while Haiti was in active civil war.
Farmer’s actions are odd, but they are only statistically odd because they exceed what
many people are willing to risk in order to help strangers. Farmer is motivated by
morality, his intent is altruistic, and he successfully prevents harm. More so, he saves
lives on a large scale.
In contrast, people with Scrupulosity are compelled by anxiety in a desperate
attempt to soothe their obsessional thoughts. However, regardless of Traig’s prodigious
ability to worry, she did not actually prevent any harm from occurring through her
compulsive acts. Some of Traig’s behaviors did put herself at risk, such as when she
developed anorexia, but her eating disorder was not a means to save other’s lives. It was
a response to internal psychological dysfunction—that is, an attempt to exert some form
of control over her external environment.
The Scrupulous, are inundated with strong compulsions to carry out acts, that
may or may not be consistent with how they want to act, but instead they feel as though
it is how they must act. There is little to no choice in the development of specific
compulsions, and certainly no choice in the onset of the disease. Farmer chose his moral
actions. This allows Farmer to elect Sainthood, a choice which Traig did not make when
performing compulsive acts of piety. Farmer’s actions are saintlier, more righteous,
because his actions are willed. But the decisional capacity he wields over his life is not
an opportunity accessible to the Scrupulous.
Instead, the Scrupulous gives into their fears. They live a life in reaction instead
of action. Farmer has the freedom to choose righteousness. The Scrupulous, may excel at
the righteous act, but the meaning of the act is limited by their volitional capability. The
Scrupulous exert control where able, for example, over their bodies in anorexia.
If we use a soccer metaphor for the Saint and the Scrupulous, the Saint would
have enrolled to join the team because they love the game and want to help their team
win. The Scrupulous would have been enrolled by someone else, and yet out of fear of
what will happen if they do not play, they join the game. The Saint’s motive is the love
of the game, his intent is score goals and thereby to win the game, and for the sake of
this metaphor, he succeeds in winning the game. The Scrupulous fearfully participates. If
they score, it is also out of fear, or incidental to their participation in the game. The
Scrupulous may win or lose the game, but it doesn’t really matter because their intent
was not to win, but to avoid what they fear. The fear of what will happen if they had not
played the game.
Both the Saint and the Scrupulous must overcome hardships. Farmer accepts
hardship and difficulties as a means to help others. For example, Farmer continues to
work in Haiti and with other populations in need even though he could settle down
safely in the United States and make a quite substantial income. Traig’s hardships are
not chosen in the way that Farmer could “take on” challenges, but rather was organic to
her nature, a consequence of her mental illness. Traig did not choose the compulsive
morality that was thrust upon her by a cocktail of biology and life setting.
A Catholic Saint who was one of the first recorded cases of Scrupulosity, Saint
Alfonso Maria de’Liguouri, wrote about his illness: “The suffering that affects
Scrupulous souls comes, not from the fact that they have a scruple about what they are
doing, but from the fear that what they are doing might be sinful and that they are, in
fact, committing sin.”(Maria de’Liguori 1999)
Saint Alfonso’s writing reinforces the concept that the Scrupulous are prompted
by anxiety. Although the Saint and the Scrupulous share a moral standard, the
Scrupulous are driven to a moral perfectionism and a desperate attempt for control, in
contrast to the Saint’s motivations. Both the Saint and the Scrupulous exceed what is
typical, but the Scrupulous strive for moral perfection, and the Saint’s goal is to save as
many lives as possible.
In Farmer’s attempt to save lives, he adopts a loose interpretation of the law. He
clearly recognizes that for the most part it is wrong to steal. To steal is to cause a harm,
but he still stole medication in order to save people in Haiti. The Saint recognizes that
some wrongs are more wrong than others. The Saint, Farmer, contrasts with the morally
obsessed. Traig is unable to accept a moral gray area, she cannot accept the uncertainty
of it, the way Farmer does.
While Farmer is able to triage the wrongness of each act, the Scrupulous cannot
weigh wrongs in the same way, and may even harm others with her militant adherence
or interpretation of “do not steal.” Farmer’s interpretation of the law contrasts with
Traig’s rigid adherence to following a Kosher diet. The Scrupulous becomes fixated on
the object of their obsession. It is this fixation, this anxiety, that compels the Scrupulous
to act in what appears to be a morally or religiously motivated way. Summers and
Sinnott-Armstrong wrote in Clean Hands?
People with Scrupulosity display a kind of rigidity or inflexibility with regard to
circumstances. They continue to perform their compulsions even in
circumstances where those compulsions make no sense (other than to relieve
their anxiety). In contrast, moral Saints limit their distinctive acts to situations
where those acts will serve their moral goals and values (J. S. Summers and W.
Sinnott-Armstrong 2019 pp 88).
This unyielding fixation sometimes causes harm—not the kind of severe harm
caused by Bundy but small harms, such as preventing family vacations because of
concerns for their mental wellbeing. Traig’s family had to adopt changes to their lifestyle
to accommodate their daughter (or sister’s) neurosis. It is only a small harm. Although
Farmer also caused small harms, he prevented far more harm than he caused. The Saint
acts morally to prevent harm from occurring to others; the Scrupulous acts morally to
satiate an urge. The Saint is a Saint not only because of his actions, but also because of
his altruistic motivations (Bommarito 2018).
The Sinner and The Scrupulous
The Sinner and the Scrupulous both suffer from mental disease. In fact, they
overlap in some of the characteristics of their individual mental illnesses. If we are to
believe Bundy’s self-report of compulsive murder, it appears that both Ted Bundy and
Jennifer Traig performed compulsive acts. These compulsions, both derived from urges,
are so dramatically different in outcome (e.g., rape versus diet restriction) to seem
incomparable. The harm caused by Traig’s compulsions is a mild inconvenience. The
harm caused by Bundy was the deaths of dozens of women.
Psychopathy researcher and psychiatrist Dr. Cleckley wrote in The Mask of Sanity
that the psychoneurotic (for our purposes—the Scrupulous) suffer obsessive thoughts
which are sometimes criminal in nature,(Cleckley 1982) such as Traig’s concern that she
might stab a loved one.(Traig 2004) She writes that although “we are neither pedophiles
nor animal lovers, we fear that we are going to rape the baby and the housecat.”(Traig
2004) Cleckley argues that someone like Traig does not carry out these compulsions
because, “they recognize the nature of these acts and do not carry them out.”(Cleckley
1982)
I disagree, the Scrupulous does not carry out these violent compulsions because
their compulsion is not one of violence. Their compulsion is the avoidance of acting
violent, e.g., avoiding knives. The obsession is the thought, or fear, that they may act
violently. The Scrupulous has a fundamental aversion to this obsession. However, the
more they attempt to not think about this obsession, the more the obsession persists.
Thus, they do all that is feasible (beyond what is reasonable) to mitigate their
anxiety surrounding their obsessive thought of, “what if I stabbed my loved one?… the
knife is right there.” The counterpart to the obsession, i.e. the compulsion, might be to
rid the house of all potential weapons. Or to go further and do whatever they can to
remove any possibility of hurting an innocent bystander. For example, they may remove
from their house any cleaning products because they might be used as poison. This is in
stark contrast to Bundy, who carried out tragic and criminal compulsions. Bundy’s
obsession was rape and murder, not the avoidance of rape and murder.
Ted Bundy claimed his sadistic urges built inside him until he could no long
resist, he would then commit murder. The 2005 FBI Symposium on Serial Killers
addressed concerns about psychopath’s ability to control their compulsions or their
potential mental diseases writing, “It is important to remember that regardless of the
specific motive(s), serial killers are compelled to commit murder—that is, they do it
because they want to and need to.” (editor 2005) Whether or not all serial killers are
compelled in the manner in which Bundy reported is not important when comparing
Bundy to Traig.
The obsessions and compulsions that the Scrupulous experience are moral in
nature, and typically or eventually cause distress, while the Sinner does not seem to be
upset by their compulsions, even their most horrific urges.(Cleckley 1982) Put another
way, Ted Bundy was not burdened with feelings of guilt, an upsetting (i.e. distressing)
emotion. In The Only Living Witness: The True Story of Serial Sex Killer Ted Bundy authors
Stephen G. Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth recorded Bundy saying, “I don’t feel guilty
for anything…. I’m in the enviable position of not having to deal with guilt…. I feel
sorry for people who feel guilt…. I don’t feel sorry for anyone who doesn’t feel guilt,
because the guilt doesn’t solve anything, really. It hurts you.”(Michaud and Aynesworth
1999)
Ted Bundy may have truthfully been tempted to sadistically murder, and
experienced this as some kind of violent obsession, but he did not regret his temptations,
nor does it appear that he attempted to deny his urges. Cleckley observed, that true
psychopaths are free from any real symptoms of anxiety or distress (i.e.
psychoneurosis).(Cleckley 1982) This contrasts with “the psychoneurotic patient…[who]
is usually anxious to get over his symptoms, while the psychopath does not show
sincere evidence of regretting his conduct or of intending to change it.”(Cleckley 1982)
Bundy’s increasingly violent tendencies did not cause him shame, as it would others,
which marks the difference between Bundy and the rest of us.
For the rest of us, those who are not psychopaths, we experience feelings of guilt
and shame. These uncomfortable feelings act as deterrents against socially destructive
acts, such as rape and murder. Not only was Bundy unimpeded by feelings of guilt and
shame, he also had poor behavioral control, consistent with a psychopathic personality.
When describing his feelings after murdering, Bundy said that “the only thing that
appeared to be relevant was not exposing himself to that risk of harm again. The
approach is, say, ‘Don’t ever do it again.’ But as time passes, the emphasis is on, ‘Don’t
get caught.’”(Michaud and Aynesworth 1999)
The Scrupulous and others who experience obsessions and compulsions are
often anxious about their compulsions. Bundy may have been anxious, but he was more
anxious about getting caught than he was about his urge to commit murder. But if both
Bundy, and those with Scrupulosity are mentally ill, this begs the question, why is
Psychopathy a mental illness? Bundy was fully aware that his actions were harmful, but
this did not deter him from acting.
Is psychopathy, as presented by Bundy, a mental illness, when there is little to no
evidence that Bundy’s compulsions or urges alone caused him pain or discomfort?
Bundy’s urges, subsequent acts, and consequences (separate from getting caught) may
not have harmed his psyche. However, his disorder did harm him. Bundy reportedly
said that "I didn't know what made people want to be friends. I didn't know what made
people attractive to one another. I didn't know what underlay social
interactions.”(Michaud and Aynesworth 2012) One of the harms caused by his condition
was the inability to have friends. Another harm was his execution. Bundy was
ultimately was sent to the electric chair for his crimes.
Not all mental diseases cause internal conflict. For example, some mental
diseases elicit responses and behaviors consistent or in harmony with one’s goals and
ideal self-image, this form of mental disorder can be considered ego-syntonic. Bundy’s
perceived lack of remorse for his actions supports the hypothesis that his mental
disorder was ego-syntonic, rather than imply that he had not mental disorder at all.
Scrupulosity, as presented by Traig in her memoir, is ego-dystonic because she resisted
and was upset by her symptoms. Her obsessions and compulsions caused her
psychological suffering.
How Scrupulosity qualifies as a mental illness is described earlier. We’ll now
apply that same framework here: a) causes disturbances in the daily life of someone with
the condition b) stems from dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or
developmental processes underlying mental functioning c) it is not explained by cultural
variances, and d) the dysfunction is not primarily between the individual and society.
Psychopathy qualifies as mental illness because a) the disease certainly causes
disturbances in their daily life. Bundy had a “normal” dimension of his life, but as his
illness progressed, his serial rape and murder took over more and more. This
culminated in his arrest and imprisonment, which is a dramatic disturbance of his daily
life. It also led to his execution, an irrevocable disturbance. b) Bundy’s life disturbances
stem from brain (i.e., biological) dysfunction and psychological dysfunction in his
underlying mental processes. Bundy’s inability to experience empathy is an example of
his psychological deficiencies. c) Bundy’s psychopathic behaviors are not explained by
cultural variances, and d) is not primarily between Bundy and his society. Bundy was
not killing as a soldier in a war, nor was he rebelling against an oppressive regime. He
was acting by himself, for himself, against individual women.
Admittedly, one may argue that Bundy’s mental disorder was primarily between
him and his society. After all, the result of his acts was imprisonment and then
execution. Conversely, the DSM-V refers to dysfunction between the individual and
society as incidences of war, rebellion, gangs, and other social conflict, that is,
nevertheless communal with other members of a rebellion, gang, etc. Additionally, they
added this qualifier so that homosexuality would not count as a disorder even when
society condemns and harms homosexuals.
Thomas Nadelhoffer and Walter Sinnott-Armstrong (2013) write that, “…because
the typical behaviors of psychopaths are behaviors of which any and every society
disapproves and punishes (Gert & Culver 2004, 421). The conflict between psychopaths
and their societies is not contingent in the same way as the conflict between societies and
harmless private sexual practices. No society could survive with too many
psychopaths”(W. Sinnott-Armstrong and Nadelhoffer 2013) referenced in The Moral
Conflict of Law and Neuroscience (Alces 2018). In other words, a classifiable distinction
between dysfunction in the individual rather than dysfunction between the individual
and society is the universality of the conflict (i.e. does every society condemn the
behaviors?).
Lastly, a significant difference between the Scrupulous and the Psychopath is
how well their compulsions mesh with, rather than conflict with, different parts of their
personalities. As mentioned earlier, Scrupulosity, as manifest in Traig is ego-dystonic,
while psychopathy, as manifested in Bundy is ego-syntonic. That is, the difference
between the Scrupulous and the Sinner is how well the compulsions mesh rather than
conflict with their personality and desires. The Scrupulous’ motive is relief from anxiety
and feelings of guilt precipitated by concerns that they may not have acted sufficiently
moral to be a good person or to please God.
The Saint, The Sinner, and The Scrupulous
The Saint, the Sinner, and the Scrupulous are all sane, at least in the lay sense of
sanity. All three are capable of rational thought. None of the three suffers from
hallucinations, delusions or disorganized thoughts. They all have the ability to both
anticipate and appraise the effects of their actions. However, the actions performed by
the Saint, Sinner, and Scrupulous are out of the ordinary. Farmer helps others, Bundy
harms others, and Traig adheres to a religious code—all to an extraordinary degree.
However, unlike Traig, Farmer’s and Bundy’s actions are ego-syntonic. Their
urges and actions are not distressing in the way that Traig’s urges and actions are
distressing; therefore, Traig’s Scrupulous behaviors can be described as ego-dystonic.
Summers and Sinnott-Armstrong write that “Scrupulosity is ego-dystonic when people
with this condition are distressed and reject and resist their symptoms. It is ego-syntonic
when they do not reject or resist their symptoms.” (J. S. Summers and W. Sinnott-
Armstrong 2019). Traig wished to be less concerned for her obsessions; thus, her mental
illness was ego-dystonic. She wished to be less impeded by her moral preoccupations.
Traig’s obsession separated her from ordinary views of morality. She did wish to live as
an Orthodox Jew, but this was different from her compulsive behaviors which led her
Rabbi to shake his head in disbelief (Traig 2004).
In contrast, Bundy’s and Farmer’s actions are ego-syntonic. They had little reason
to show regret for what they’ve done or to have any intent to change their behavior
because it meshed with all aspects of their personality. Bundy’s desires were hedonistic
and intentionally caused harm. In contrast, the obsessions of the Scrupulous are
decidedly anti-hedonistic. Traig was pathologically good at self-denial, albeit in response
to anxiety she experienced.
All three—Bundy, Farmer, and Traig—can be characterized by their excesses.
Farmer’s excess is his generosity, charity, and self-sacrifice. Bundy epitomized an excess
of hedonism, and sacrifices others instead of himself. The Scrupulous, too, is excessive.
Traig is excessive in her self-denial and her anxiety. She denies herself food in an
attempt to keep Kosher to such a degree that she was left eating only dried fruit. Bundy
displays excessive hedonism, self-gratification at the risk of other’s well-being (their
life), violence, and disregard for law.
All three cause hurt beyond their self. Farmer hurt his friends like Ophelia, who
wrote of “the strain of living with a fellow who was in love with something else,
something that I could never compete with, even if I’d wanted to.”(Kidder 2009)
Bundy’s harm is self-explanatory, and Traig caused harm by inconveniencing her
family. Their actions are incomparable in the sense of harm. The fact that Traig and
Farmer cause harm seems secondary to their behaviors of excess, their extraordinary
acts. Without excessive charity, Farmer would see his friends and family more often.
Without excess consideration to keeping Kosher, Traig would not continue to
inconvenience her family.
The three can be distinguished by the way they view other people. Farmer said,
“There’s a lot to be said for sacrifice, remorse, even pity. It’s what separates us from
roaches.” (Kidder 2009) Farmer’s view is like Bundy’s in that all beyond oneself has
equal dignity. No one person is better than others. On the other hand, Farmer’s view is
the antithesis of Bundy’s in that for Bundy, the difference between the dignity of people
and the dignity of roaches is blurred at best. For example, after murdering Georgann
Hawkins on June 11th, 1974 Bundy tossed out the crowbar, briefcase, handcuffs and
other items he had used in the murder. When recounting this event in an interview
Bundy said, “I get mad at myself because I had to go out the next week to buy another
pair, it’s not comical but that’s just how it is.”(Ted Bundy In His Own Words The Death
Row Tapes Serial Killer Documentary n.d.) Bundy was more concerned with the handcuffs
he lost, an inanimate object, than the woman he killed. What’s more, Bundy didn’t seem
to realize what a horrible thing he just said.
Traig views people as being at risk by being around her. She was overly worried
that she had poisoned someone. For example, Traig repeatedly asked her sister or
parents, “I’m not going to poison you, am I? I’m really worried I’m going to poison
you,” even though she had no practical reason to believe that she had ever harmed
someone. The Scrupulous ruminates, checks, rechecks (and then maybe just one more
time) to ensure that they did not unintentionally cause harm. For Traig other people are
at risk just being near her.
Traig wrote, “though obsessive compulsives’ primary fear is that we might hurt
others, we’re so much less likely than the general population to actually do so… too
caught up in our own worries and routines to unleash our negative impulses on
others.”(Traig 2004) She also believed that her actions had disproportionate effect on the
protection or harm of others. In her memoir she describes washing a plate three more
times so that her family wouldn’t die: “So, I tapped the bookcase, I washed the plate,
and guess what: everything was okay. They didn’t die. Abracadabra. Magic.”(Traig
2004)
Traig or, more broadly, those with Scrupulosity attribute themselves with
increased responsibility of harm that occurs in the world. For example, Traig lists
“Global Events for Which I considered myself responsible.”(Traig 2004) The list included
such events as: the eruption of Mount Saint Helens, Chernobyl, the crash of the space
shuttle Challenger, all North American kidnappings, 1982-87 (Traig 2004). Ironically, if
she only blamed herself for kidnappings between 1982-87, this means she did not blame
herself for any of the kidnappings (and murders) committed by our Sinner and
psychopath, Bundy.
Conclusion
Paul Farmer is a saint. He is a saint because he leads a life worthy of emulation.
He willingly sacrifices for the good of others, not out of compulsion, but because he
believes it to be the right thing to do. He is a Saint because he hardens his own life in
order to improve others. He adopts greater responsibility and accepts a greater sense of
duty not only to his friends and family, but also to people whom he does not personally
know or who live far from him. In his pursuit of helping others, Farmer adopts a loose
interpretation of the law, because he follows a higher moral law than hospital
regulations about not stealing life-saving drugs for people who need life-saving drugs.
Bundy is a serial murderer and rapist. His mental illness is psychopathy.
Bundy’s urges to rape and murder did not derive from his psychopathy, but from the
accompanying sexual sadism. However, his psychopathy prevented him from feeling
empathy for the women he attacked and subsequently killed. Empathy would have
served as a natural barrier to his sadistic inclinations. Without empathy, Bundy could
not understand the crimes he committed in the way those of us with intact emotion
processing could. He knew what he did was wrong, against the law, and caused harm,
but he could not relate to that harm because his dysfunction in relating to others’ pain.
Traig too has a mental illness. She has Scrupulosity. Like Bundy, she also has
compulsions, but her compulsions about avoiding harm to others, strict adherence to the
laws written in the Torah. Traig’s moral perfectionism, chronic doubt, and moral
though-act fusion led to conflicts with her family and within herself. Nevertheless, she
overcame adversity to lead a successful life as a spokesperson and author. Traig is a
representative of the Jewish Book Council, earned her PhD in English, was interviewed
by NPR for her published works, and is still a practicing Jew. Her practice of religion is
currently not one of disorder but of desire from a sound mind.
Neither Traig nor Farmer caused severe harm to others, but Bundy did. Neither
Traig nor Bundy prevented harm to others, but Farmer did. Both Traig and Bundy acted
in response to the mental illness, that is, they acted in self-interest. Farmer was motived
by morality. Farmer and Bundy’s actions were ego-syntonic. Neither Farmer nor Bundy
followed strict adherence to the rules, but to different ends. Farmers lackadaisical
approach to the law served to help the sick and dying. Bundy’s blatant disregard for the
law meant he had one less obstacle to carrying out his ghastly acts.
Thus, all three overlap in various ways. There is little that simultaneously
connects all three other than their abnormality in their approach to morality. Farmer is
hyper-moral, Bundy was amoral, and Traig is pathologically moral. The Saint and the
Sinner, the Sinner and the Scrupulous, and the Saint and the Scrupulous overlap in ways
that connect three seemingly unrelated people. The point of this comparison is to show
patterns of shared behaviors because, perhaps by doing so, an approach can be
developed such that our society has more Saints, less Sinners, and treatment for those
with Scrupulosity.
Part II – Pilot Studies
Part I examined three cases. One of extreme immorality, one of altruism, and one
of Scrupulosity. The presentation of all three cases served to put the disorder of
Scrupulosity in higher relief. In Part II we build on some of the aspects of Scrupulosity
highlighted in Part I by examining the statistics. In other words, we ran a number of
studies to better understand Scrupulosity. Additionally, we considered how
Scrupulosity may influence an individual’s perception of self and others’ moral
transgressions.
As summarized in Part I, Scrupulosity is a form of OCD that focuses on morality.
The objectives of previous research on Scrupulosity were to address the core features of
the mental illness, i.e. obsessions and compulsions that are religious or moral in nature.
Jonathan S. Abramowitz et al developed a questionnaire to measure Scrupulosity.
Abramowitz et al, compiled an initial pool of 77 questionnaire items based on
verbal reports, and “face validity of the constructs we were attempting to measure”
(Abramowitz 2002). Subsequently, they shortened the scale to a 19-item measure
including both secular and religious questions using a statistical method referred to as
exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The scale was termed the PIOS (Penn Inventory of
Scrupulosity) (Abramowitz et al 2002).
A few years later, researcher Olantunji at Vanderbilt, published a revised 15-item
scale, termed the PIOS-R (Penn Inventory of Scrupulosity-Revised)(Olatunji et al. 2007).
The PIOS and PIOS-R are useful tools, however, one of the problems in studying
Scrupulosity is that the current measure of the disorder is religiously themed. Both the
PIOS and PIOS-R include items that seem inappropriate for secular persons because the
items refer to god, hell, or other specifically religious beliefs (Abramowitz et al. 2002)
methods.
Having a religiously themed inventory is problematic because Scrupulosity does
not only manifest in religious obsession, but also pathological morality. Both the atheist
and the religiously devout may be stricken with Scrupulosity. That being said, the
symptoms of Scrupulosity may present differently in religious versus non-religious
populations. Thus, there is a need to develop a secularized form of the PIOS scale.
Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, Jesse Summers, and I are interested in developing a
novel scale intended to test for Scrupulosity more broadly in secular patients as well as
those who identify with a religious group. We want to examine how Scrupulosity differs
and remains the same when presenting in atheistic and agnostic populations.
Therefore, we’re looking to develop a derivation of the PIOS questionnaire that
will be inclusive of secular persons with moral obsessions, so that we can use the
questionnaire to address research questions about moral decision making. This is
important when considering the attribution of responsibility, and the degree to which
we credit or blame individual actors.
For the purposes of this thesis no new data was collected. This is in part due to
complications regarding COVID-19. However, when researching Scrupulosity
previously, Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, Jesse Summers, and post-doc Christine Lillie,
collected preliminary data for a secular Scrupulosity scale (J. S. Summers and W.
Sinnott-Armstrong 2019). I have been generously offered the use of this data collected in
2013. The synthesis and analysis presented in the rest of this paper is from the 2013 data
set.
Study I
Study I started with the original 77-item pool developed by Abramowitz, David
F. Tolin, and Shawn P. Cahill.(Abramowitz et al. 2002) These three researchers generated
the items based on extensive clinical experience and patient interviews. The item bank
included various statements about religious and moral obsessional thoughts and
compulsive behaviors (Abramowitz et al. 2002).
Our first step was to create secular analogs to 77 items. We then used the items to
develop a secular scale. The scale was created by running an EFA using R lavaan, psych,
and foreign packages (R Core Team, 2013), (Rosseel, 2012).
An EFA is a statistical method used to cluster a number of items or variables into
broader, but fewer latent variables (Nadelhoffer et al. 2014). For example, in this study
we started with a large number of items and statistically distilling the items into
broader categories we were able shrink the number of items allowing for a more
manageable psychometric that may be used in studies (Nadelhoffer et al. 2014).
The clusters modeled by the EFA are known as factors. A factor is presumed to
represent an underlying construct. Factor extraction is the process by which one
determines how many factors are represented in the list of items when conducting an
EFA. Factor extraction typically occurs using one of two methods: Cattell’s Scree method
(1966) or Kaiser criterion (1960).
The Cattell’s scree method uses a scree chart of eigenvalues to visually examine
the distribution greatest drop between eigenvalues. The number of factors prior to the
drop or at the “elbow” of the scree chart are retained. An eigenvalue is a scalar measure,
or a value with magnitude but not direction, that helps to measure how items in a factor
analysis cluster when using a statistical method (Weisstein, 2020).
Kaiser criterion (1960) also utilizes eigenvalues. When using this method one
computes the related eigen value to each possible factor and values over 1.0 are retained
for the model. The Scree test has been criticized for relying on subjective interpretation
and the Kaiser criterion has been criticized for over factoring (Nadelhoffer et al, 2014).
Once the number of factors are extracted from the data sample, the next step is to
calculate the factor loading. Factor loading is the process by which the items or variables
are categorized by underlying constructs when running a factor analysis (Nadelhoffer et
al, 2014).
The development of the PIOS and PIOS-R scale found a two-factor model based
on an exploratory factor analysis (Abramowitz, Huppert, Cohen, Tolin, & Cahill, 2002).
The authors identified “fear of sin”(FOS) and “fear of god” (FOG) as their two factors.
They came to this conclusion by examining the items which clustered together. Factor I
related broadly to “fears of acting or thinking sinfully and the interference in
functioning caused by such fears.” (Abramowitz e al, 2002) and was thus termed FOS.
The second factor related to fears of god and his punishment and was therefore labeled
as FOG (Abramowitz et al, 2002).
The two factors were sufficiently distinct to be used as two sub-scales
(Abramowitz et al 2002). Their conclusion is supported by internal consistency
(Abramowitz et al 2002) shown by the calculation of Cronbach’s alpha for the full scale,
and two subscales FOS and FOG (α=0.93, α=0.90, α=0.88 respectively).
The revision of the PIOS, the PIOS-R, supported the two-factor model suggested
by Abramowitz et al. (Olantunji, 2007). In the revision, Olantunji, 2007 removed four
items from the PIOS due to redundancy and shared residual variance in the
development of the PIOS-R. The subsequent factor loading matched the PIOS save for
the four removed items.
The removal of the four items led Huppert and Fradkin, 2016, to suggest that the
factor/sub-scale identified as FOS by Abramowitz et al. may be better identified as “fear
of immorality” (FOI). The authors suggested this change because the items which
remained on FOS emphasize immorality rather than sinful action more broadly
(Huppert and Fradkin, 2016).
Based on previous research we hypothesized that the EFA of the secularized
items will likely represent a single factor, related to FOI, in contrast to the 2-factor
model. This is because the secularized items do not mention god, and therefore it is
unlikely that a factor measuring FOG will manifest. We hypothesize the inter-reliability
of the secularized scale will be high. We also hypothesize the secularized scale will more
strongly correlate to the FOI than to the full PIOS and the FOG subscale.
Methods
We adapted the 77-item bank developed by Abramowitz et al, 2002, by keeping
all non-religious items (about 39) and altering overtly religious items (about 38). We did
this by rewriting phrases such as “I am afraid my thoughts are unacceptable to god” to
“I am afraid my thoughts are morally unacceptable.” If items were either not secular or
could not be easily secularized we left the item unchanged. Below we give examples of
the religious items we secularized. This is not a comprehensive list, only a sampling.

We enrolled 97 participants through the online site MTurk. Participants rated
their distress and frequency of the secular analogs, the PIOS questionnaire, and basic
demographic questions.
Participants were asked to respond using a five-point Likert-type scale to
measure frequency and distress levels caused by symptoms (Abramowitz, 2002).
Participants rated how frequently they experienced what was described in the item and
how distressing that experience was.
frequency ratings: 0=never
1=rarely/almost never;
2=sometimes;
3=often;
4=constantly
distress ratings: 0=not at all distressing
1=minimally distressing;
2=moderately;
3=severely;
4=extremely
PIOS-S Exploratory Factor Analysis
To conduct the EFA on the secular items we planned to use principle axis
extraction and promax rotation for factor extraction. We chose principle axis extraction
and Promax rotation because principle axis is better at recovering weak factors
(Coughlin 2013) thus this is a preferred method for scale development. We used promax
rotation because the most recently published examination of the PIOS factor structure
used promax (Philips and Fisak 2020) and we want to minimize confounds when
comparing results.
Following the first round of EFA, we narrowed the items by removing redundant
or similarly worded items, keeping the item of the redundant pair by assessing which
has greater loading or is more normally distributed (about 30 items). Further items are
removed if they do not singularly load or their loading was less than .4 (about 20 items).
Factor loadings above .400 are typically considered substantial based on Hair et
al.’s suggested EFA protocol for scale development (Hair et al., 1998); therefore we only
retained item loadings over 0.4.
Finally we removed items by fit and the likelihood of construct measurement
based on what items substantially load onto which factor.
Participants rated both their frequency as well as their level of distress when;
therefore, we calculated separate scores for frequency, distress and composite (the
average of both frequency and distress) by averaging responses between questions. The
frequency score and distress score were strongly correlated (p<.001).
Since frequency scores were more normally distributed than distress scores
between participants, we conducted the factor analysis using the frequency score
consistent with the method used by Abramowitz et al, 2002. Finally, we hypothesized
what the items have in common. This resulted in a 10-item scale we termed PIOS-S for
PIOS-secularized.
PIOS Confirmatory Factor Analysis
Our next proposed step was to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on
the PIOS. We used the method to determine whether the data from the current sample
fits adequately to the two-factor model cited by Abramowitz et al., 2002 and Olatunji et
al., 2007. The purpose of conducting the CFA is in part to test whether our sample data
is similar enough to data samples previously collected to compare results.
A CFA is a factor analysis like an EFA; however, a CFA measures the “fit” of a
statistical model for the data (Nadelhoffer et al. 2014). In other words, a CFA analyzes
how well an inventory or questionnaire measures what we believe to be the underlying
constructs hypothesized as a prior.
PIOS Exploratory Factor Analysis
If the model was found to be a poor fit with our sample, then we planned to run
an EFA. The EFA is used to confirm that the model identified by Abramowitz et al, 2002
and Olantunji et al., 2007 is the best model to fit our data sample relative to other models
despite a “poor fit.”
When developing a new scale one starts by running an EFA to see how the items
cluster. The EFA is then used as a prior when conducting the next stage of scale
development. The next stage of scale development requires more data collection in order
to conduct a CFA on the prior suggested by the results of the EFA.
A CFA confirms the clustering measured by the EFA. One needs a prior to
conduct the CFA because one needs the predicted factor loading in order to conduct the
CFA. The data collected in the first study for the EFA cannot be used for the conducting
of the following CFA when developing a new scale.
This convention is different for already validated and published scales. We still
conduct the CFA when using a factored scale to confirm similarities in data sets.
However, since data samples can vary, and a factor analysis has some subjective
elements, an EFA is used to determine if the CFA prior is the best fit for the data sample
collected by researchers.
Additionally, fit is relative, so when a fit is “poor” this just means the fit indices
do not meet standardized ideals. For example, we hope the fit indices, RMSEA, is under
0.08. When a CFA does not have a RMSEA under 0.08, but the EFA confirms the factor
extraction and loading, then we can extrapolate that the prior is still the best fit relative
to the data sample.
A poor fit may be due to a relatively low sample size. The fewer participants in a
study, the more difficult it is to run a factor analysis. Typically, an EFA requires two to
three hundred participants for consistent results (Nadelhoffer et al. 2014).
We ran an EFA using principle axis extraction and promax rotation consistent
with protocol used by Philips and Fisak (Phillips and Fisak 2020). Items which loaded
onto a single factor and loaded greater than .4 were considered valid in the EFA for the
PIOS scale.
Additionally, we planned to see how the PIOS-R splinters when running the
EFA. Abramowitz et al suggested two subscales form from the PIOS and PIOS-R.
Therefore, we planned to correlate the two subscales with scores collected on the secularized
EFA results (Abramowitz et al. 2002).
Correlations between the secular scale and PIOS subscales
We planned to calculate the correlations between the secular scale suggested by
the EFA results and the PIOS subscales proposed by Abramowitz et al., 2002 and
Olantunji et al, 2007. We ran correlation by comparing the composite score of the PIOS,
PIOS (FOI), PIOS (FOG), and with the proposed secular scale. We then compare the
correlation coefficients to determine if the secular scale is significantly more correlated
with either the FOI or FOG subscale.
Results
PIOS-S EFA Results
The results of the EFA suggests that all items load onto a single factor. We
X2/df = 17.60, Tuker-Lewis index [TLI] = .921, BIC = - 79.560, root mean square error
approximation [RMSEA] = .122. Cronbach’s alpha for this factor was excellent at α=.951.
A single factor loading suggests that the items measure a singular construct. In
this case, the construct identified as FOI (Huppert and Fradkin, 2016). This is in contrast
with Abramowitz et al. 2002 findings, which identified two factors, FOS and FOG
(Abramowitz, 2002).

Although there is some ambiguity as to whether a one or two factor model is the
best fit for our data sample when using the Cattell’s Scree Test (Cattell, 1966) confirming
with the use of the Kaiser method confirms the best model uses a single factor (Kaiser,
1960). Additionally, the fit indices are improved with a single factor over a second
factor.

PIOS CFA Results
We ran a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the responses to the PIOS, which
bore results similar to the findings of Abramowitz et al, a two factor best-fit. (Olatunji et
al. 2007) The PIOS-R CFA, X2 /df = 12.6, Tuker-Lewis index [TLI] = .765, Comparative Fit
Index [CFI] = .801 root mean square error approximation [RMSEA] = .180. Cronbach’s
alpha for this factor was excellent at α=.957. The mean score was 1.502 (SD = .076 ). The
CFA found that the data from the current sample was a poor fit with the prior according
to fit indices. Therefore we conducted an EFA.
PIOS EFA Results
The EFA confirmed that the two-factor model was indeed the best fit for this data
Although, neither the CFA nor the EFA had a good “fit” indicated by the analysis, the
relative fit (how the fit compares to alternative models) supports the prior.
factor loading would best fit the sample data. However, since the second factor loads
with an Eigenvalue under 0.4 convention using the Kaiser Criterion for factor extraction
suggests that a single factor is the best fit (Kaiser, 1960). This also bore out in other fit
indices, a 2-factor EFA loaded most items on both factors; thereby, not distinguishing
between possible underlying constructs.
items 2, 6, 10, and 15 were removed for the PIOS-R. We conducted the EFA on the PIOS
since we collected responses in study II with the PIOS not the PIOS-R.

PIOS sub-scale PIOS-S Correlation Analysis
In contrast to the PIOS-S, the PIOS and the PIOS-R scales can be splintered into
two subscales (Abramowitz et al, 2002; Olatunji et al, 2007; Huppert and Fradkin, 2016;
Phillips and Fisak, 2020). These sub-scales are “fear of sin”—later renamed “fear of
immorality”—and “fear of god” (Abramowitz et al. 2002).
The PIOS and PIOS-S are highly correlated (0.911***, p < 0.001), the PIOS-S is
significantly more correlated with the PIOS subscale of “fear of immorality” (0.901*** p <
which means the relationship between the two correlation coefficients between FOS and
Items which load onto FOG have explicitly religious themes. The only item that
did not explicitly mention “god”, but nevertheless loaded onto “fear of god” was “I
worry about heaven and hell” an item which nevertheless has religious themes. In
comparison, none of the secular analogs mention god or overtly religious themes, and
all load onto a single factor.

Discussion
The CFA for the PIOS displayed a poor fit for our sample population. Not only
was RMSEA not under 0.08 it was well above; however, after conducting an EFA to
consider best bit, the EFA confirmed that a two factor extraction was best for the PIOS
data sample. Again, this is relative to the fit of either a single or three...etc. factor model.
Using a different factor loading and factor number did not improve fit; thereby
supporting the prior for the PIOS scale.
Since the PIOS-S loads singularly and the PIOS loads on two factors, this
suggests the PIOS-S measures a single underlying construct while the PIOS-R measures
two. The PIOS-S fits a single factor based on the Cattell scree test and the Kaiser criteria,
the PIOS measures two constructs. Despite this difference the PIOS and PIOS-S are
strongly correlated (.911***, p<0.001).
The PIOS and PIOS-S greatly overlap, but the PIOS also measures FOG, a
religious construct. Therefore supporting our hypothesis that the PIOS-S throws a
broader net for persons who my experience symptoms, especially those who present
with a moral or secular form of the disorder but without necessarily strong religious
affiliation or beliefs. A way to test this hypothesis in the future may be to measure scores
on the PIOS versus the PIOS-S while controlling for religiosity.
The PIOS-S is significantly correlated to the FOI and FOG - PIOS subscales.
However the PIOS-S is significantly more correlated to the FOI subscale. This supports
our hypothesis that a secularized PIOS scale was more likely to measure FOI than FOG.
Study II
For the second pilot study we applied the results from the first study. In study I
the secularized 77-item pool was reduced to a 10-item PIOS-S scale by using the
statistical method EFA. In study II, we plan to follow study I by conducting a CFA to
measure the fit of the data to PIOS-S. We recruited 140 participants through MTurk for a
two-stage study to test the validity of the items.
Method
Subjects were recruited through an online participant pool. The study comprised
of two stages: Time 1 (T1) and Time 2 (T2) which occurred 3 weeks apart. We conducted
the study in two stages so that we can compare test-re-test reliability, variance across
time, and statistical difference between PIOS-S and PIOS both at T1 and T2.
At the first stage of the study, participants (n = 140) responded to the secularized
10-item scale (PIOS-S) and answered demographic questions including items on
religiosity and political conservatism/liberalism. The demographic items were as
follows:
1. Please Indicate your age
2. Gender;
3. Please indicate which religious affiliation best describes
you;
4. How strongly do you affiliate with your religion;
5. How strongly do you hold your religious beliefs;
6. How strongly do you agree with the teaching of your
religion;
7. Please indicated how frequently you attend religious
worship service;
8. Generally Speaking do you consider yourself to be more
liberal or conservative leaning?
Based off of the responses to questions 3-7 we were able to control for religion
when calculating relationships between scores on the PIOS-S and PIOS. By using
answers to question 8 as a covariate we were able to control for political leaning when
calculating relationships between PIOS-S and PIOS scores.
At T2, 114 participants were retained from T1. The participants completed either
the PIOS-S or the PIOS. Participants did not repeat demographic questions. At T2, 57
participants responded to the PIOS-S and 57 different participants responded to the
PIOS. Scores were calculated by averaging the response to each item.
We measured the correlation coefficient between PIOS-PIOS-S and PIOS-S-PIOS-
between scores on the PIOS and PIOS-S with both religiosity and political conservatism.
Additionally, we ran a CFA on the PIOS-S to verify that a single factor best fits
with the PIOS-S and supporting our hypothesis that the PIOS-S measures a single
construct. We ran this statistical method using R “foreign” package (R Core Team, 2013),
R “lavaan” package (Rosseel Y 2012), and JASP (JASP 2020).

Discussion
In the results we report a significant correlation between PIOS-S at T1 and T2,
this indicates good test-re-test reliability. The significant correlation between the PIOS-
PIOS-S is also notable because it suggests that the questionnaires are measuring similar
underlying constructs. In one interpretation, this means that it does not really matter
which scale one uses; however, given the overtly religious elements of the PIOS versus
the PIOS-S more research addressing the specific score variations between religious and
non-religious groups would better assess if the PIOS-S has a broader application to
persons with Scrupulosity regardless of religious affiliation.
Both the PIOS-S and PIOS are significantly correlated to political conservatism
but only the PIOS is significantly correlated to religiosity. This offers more support for
our hypothesis that the PIOS-S casts a wider-net for Scrupulosity beyond religiosity.
What’s more, the correlation is not only significant, but also, z = -2.87. This means that
the relationship between the PIOS-S and religiosity, and PIOS and religiosity, are 2.87
standard deviations away from mean. Simply put, the distinction between religiosity
correlated with the PIOS versus the PIOS-S is statistically strong.
The PIOS-S CFA confirms the fit of a single factor to the PIOS-S. Ideally, for a
factor analysis we would like to see a REMSEA under 0.08; however this was unlikely to
happen with the number of participants to item ration. Instead, we can use the various
fit indices to inform the appropriateness of the scale relative to other fits. The CFA for a
single factor is therefore the best fit for the scale relative to other factor models, such as a
two or three factor CFA.
Study III
Morality is comprised of values and principles held at both the individual and
social level.(Graham, Haidt, and Nosek 2009) The MFQ which participants answered in
our study was developed by moral psychology researchers Jesse Graham, Johnathan
Haidt, and Brian Nosek (Graham, Haidt, and Nosek 2009). The questionnaire was based
on the Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) (Graham, Haidt, and Nosek 2009). We chose to
use the MFQ because we hypothesized that people who scored high on the PIOS/PIOS-R
would put greater weight on the purity, loyalty, and authority foundations than people
who score high on the PIOS-S, but not the PIOS/PIOS-R. This hypothesis was based on
previous research finding that purity, loyalty, and authority were related to religious
belief (along with conservative politics). MFT broadly categorizes the aspects of
morality into 5 (sometimes 6) moral foundations. These foundations include harm,
fairness, ingroup, authority, and purity (Graham, Haidt, and Nosek 2009).
Harm/care: “The long history of mammalian evolution has shaped maternal
brains to be sensitive to signs of suffering in one’s own offspring. In many
primate species, particularly humans, this sensitivity has extended beyond the
mother-child relationship so that all normally developed individuals dislike
seeing suffering in others, and have the potential to feel the emotion of
compassion in response.” (Haidt and Graham, 2007 pp 104).
Fairness/Reciprocity: “The long history of alliance formation and cooperation
among unrelated individuals in many primate species has led to the evolution of
a suite of emotions that motivate reciprocal altruism, including anger, guilt, and
gratitude (Trivers, 1971). Because people feel these emotions when they observe
or engage in reciprocal interactions, all cultures have developed virtues related
to fairness and justice.” (Haidt and Graham, 2007 pp 105)
Ingroup/Loyalty: “The long history of living in kin-based groups of a few dozen
individuals (for humans as well as other primate species) has led to special
social-cognitive abilities backed up by strong social emotions related to
recognizing, trusting, and cooperating with members of one’s co-residing
ingroup while being wary and distrustful of members of other groups.” (Haidt
and Graham, 2007 pp 105)
Authority/Respect: “The long history of living in hierarchically-structured
ingroups, where dominant males and females get certain perquisites but are also
expected to provide certain protections or services, has shaped human (and
chimpanzee, and to a lesser extent bonobo) brains to help them flexibly navigate
in hierarchical communities. Dominance in other primate species relies heavily
on physical force and fear, but in human communities the picture is more
nuanced, relying largely on prestige and voluntary deference (Henrich and Gil-
White, 2001).” (Haidt and Graham, 2007 pp 105)
Purity/Sanctity: “Disgust appears to function as a guardian of the body in all
cultures, responding to elicitors that are biologically or culturally linked to
disease transmission…In many cultures, disgust goes beyond such contaminant-
related issues and supports a set of virtues and vices linked to bodily activities in
general, and religious activities in particular. Those who seem ruled by carnal
passions (lust, gluttony, greed, and anger) are seen as debased, impure, and less
than human, while those who live so that the soul is in charge of the body
(chaste, spiritually minded, pious) are seen as elevated and sanctified” (Haidt
and Graham 2007 pp 106).
In other words, harm is the opposite of care, the protection of others.(Graham,
Haidt, and Nosek 2009) Fairness/reciprocity is the equal division of resources and justice
according to the societies’ rules.(Graham, Haidt, and Nosek 2009) The moral foundation
ingroup denotes the loyalty of an individual to the group, such as the family, culture, or
nation. (Graham, Haidt, and Nosek 2009) Authority is an individual’s submission to
tradition and hierarchical leadership, opposite to subversion.(Graham, Haidt, and Nosek
2009) Finally, purity, arises from feelings of disgust which serves by a group.(Graham,
Haidt, and Nosek 2009) For example, an abhorrence against certain foods (like pork),
desires (such as lust), and behaviors (e.g. cannibalism).
Johnathan Haidt’s discusses a sixth moral foundation, liberty by referencing Iyer
et al, 2011, in his book The Righteous Mind (Haidt, 2012). However, the data collected in
our study does not attempt to measure the moral foundation of liberty and is thus not
further considered in this thesis.
The MFQ is a brief questionnaire which measures the importance different
people place on each foundation, both narrowly for an individual and broadly for a
culture or group (Graham, Haidt, and Nosek 2009). The five foundations further cluster
into two groups, an individualizing cluster and a binding cluster.(Graham, Haidt, and
Nosek 2009) The individualizing cluster includes the fairness and harm foundations.
While the binding cluster encompasses the foundations of authority, purity, and
ingroup (edited by John T. Jost 2009; Graham, Haidt, and Nosek 2009).
In addition to the MFQ, participants in our studies answered a questionnaire
quantifying belief in a just world (BJW). A higher score suggests a higher adherence to
BJW (Lerner 1980). Much like MFT, Just World Theory or belief in a just world (BJW) is
displayed by both individuals and groups.(Lerner 1980) The BJW hypothesis was well
summarized in the seminal book “The Belief in a Just World” by Lerner and Miller
(1978):
Individuals have a need to believe that they live in a world where people
generally get what they deserve. The belief that the world is just enables the
individual to confront his physical and social environment as though they were
stable and orderly. Without such a belief it would be difficulty for the individual
to commit himself to the pursuit of long range goals or even to the socially
regulated behaviour of the day to day life. Since the belief that the world is just
serves such an important adaptive function for the individual, people are very
reluctant to give up this belief, and they can be greatly troubled if they encounter
evidence that suggests that the world is not really just or orderly after all. (Lerner
and Miller, 1978, pp. 1030-1031)
In other words, BJW refers to the belief that the world is more or less fair and
just, people who are wronged will be properly compensated, and overall people get
what they deserve.(Clara Sabbagh 2016) Furthermore, data suggests that general BJW
correlates with harsher judgement of others over self, victim blaming and derogation of
the disadvantaged groups (Lipkus et al., 1996; Bègue and Bastounis, 2003; for a recent
overview see Hafer and Sutton, 2016)(Clara Sabbagh 2016). We chose to measure BJW
because previous research has suggested that religiosity has a negative correlation with
BJW (Hafer and Sutton 2016); therefore, we hypothesized that higher scores on the
PIOS/PIOS-R but not the PIOS would be negatively correlated with BJW.
Methods
We recruited 104 participants through MTurk as part of study II. Participants
completed the Moral Foundations Questionnaire and either the PIOS (n = 57) or PIOS-S
(n = 57) scale also during study II. They answered demographic questions relating to
religiosity and political leaning. We correlated their scores on the MFQ with scores on
the PIOS and PIOS-S, while controlling for religiosity and political conservatism.
Results
We found that after controlling for religiosity and political conservatism the
PIOS-S scale significantly correlated with Fairness, In-group, Authority, and Purity. The
PIOS scale significantly correlated with Harm, In-group, Authority, Purity and BJW. see

Discussion
By controlling for religiosity and political conservatism we found that the PIOS-S
scale significantly correlated with Fairness, In-group, Authority, and Purity, this
supports our hypothesis that people who scored high on the PIOS/PIOS-R would put
greater weight on the purity, loyalty, and authority foundations than people who score
high on the PIOS-S, but not the PIOS/PIOS-R. However, the data also suggests a
correlation between higher scores on the PIOS and fairness which we had not
hypothesized.
Moreover, of the PIOS-MFQ correlations, only authority is significantly more
related to PIOS-S over the PIOS. This suggests a stronger difference in those who score
highly on the PIOS versus the PIOS-S and the moral foundation authority.
The stark difference between the correlation results between controlling and not
controlling for religiosity and political leaning suggests the strong impact religiosity and
political leaning has on the relationship between the PIOS, PIOS-S, MFQ, and BJW.
Although the preliminary data on correlations between moral foundations and
BJW and the PIOS-S and PIOS-R are mixed there are sufficient data to warrant more
testing.
Study IV
There are circumstances in which persons judge themselves more severely than
others, for example, Jennifer Traig criticizes her own acts but not acts of her parents
when they look at portraits (Traig, 2004).
In study IV we considered the relationship between Scrupulosity and moral
judgement of first versus third parties. We hypothesized that people with Scrupulosity
would make harsher judgments of themselves than of third parties. Our hypothesis was
based both on a 2008 paper by Thomas Nadelhoffer and Adam Feltz (Nadelhoffer and
Feltz, 2008) which explored first versus third person moral judgements, and on
observations of case studies described in “Clean Hands?” (J.S. Summers and Sinnott-
Armstrong, 2019).
Although we asked participants to respond to both the PIOS and the PIOS-S, we
had no hypothesis of whether a difference in scores on the PIOS and the PIOS-S would
correlate with judgement of first versus third person moral transgressions.
Methods
We constructed and piloted ten vignettes describing different moral dilemmas.
We developed two versions of each vignette, such that they were written in either the
first or third person. For example:
First person:
“You and your sister are very close, and both of you are usually law-abiding.
One day, however, your sister told you that she was in big trouble with the IRS.
She had been audited. During the audit, she had sworn under oath that she used
one room in her house as an office, even though she had never used it as an
office. She lied to the IRS agent because she had claimed that room as a
deduction on the tax form that she had filed earlier, and she would owe extra
taxes if the deduction were not allowed. Unfortunately, the IRS agent doing the
audit asked for confirmation that she really did use that room as a home office.
She told the agent that you would vouch for her. She regretted having done all of
this, but it was too late to take it back. She begged you to tell the agent that she
had used the room as an office. If you had refused to lie to the agent, your sister
would have gone to jail for perjury. However, there was no chance of you getting
in trouble. So you testified to the agent that you had seen your sister using that
room as a home office.”
Third person:
“Ted is operating a crane to move a load of bricks, and, although he is an
experienced construction worker, he does not seem to notice that if he moves the
bricks all the way to their destination, the crane will become overextended and
might collapse. Jack is sitting 30 yards away from the crane, having lunch. Jack
thinks to himself: “This look dangerous. I'm not sure if the crane can make it all
the way.” Jack hesitates and, before he says anything, the main arm of the crane
collapses, and the crane falls over.” (Haidt and Baron 1996)
160 participants were recruited through MTurk. They read the ten vignettes, all
written in either the 1st or 3rd person—each participant had examples of both 1st and 3rd
person—and answered questions about moral blameworthiness and punishment for
each vignette, using a 10-point scale. Specifically they were asked, “How morally wrong
are your [Jack’s] actions?”; “How morally wrong would most people think your [Jack’s]
actions are?”; “How much should you [Jack] be punished for your [his] actions?”. The
participants also completed either the PIOS-S or the PIOS scale.
Results
Our regression analysis revealed that Scrupulosity measured by both the PIOS
and PIOS-S scales impact punishment decisions, albeit in very different ways (R2=.066,
adjusted R2=.036, F(5, 159)=2.425, p=.06). For each unit increase on the PIOS scale,
punishment severity increased at a higher rate in the 1st party condition (1.3 points per
unit change in PIOS) as opposed to the 3rd party condition (1.0 point per unit change in
PIOS). We found an opposite pattern with the PIOS-S measurement: for each unit
increase on the PIOS-S scale, punishment severity significantly increased at a higher rate
in the 3rd party condition (1.5 points per unit change in PIOS) as opposed to the 1st
In other words, the PIOS and PIOS-S both predict relative (predicting first versus
third person) punishment decisions in first versus third person moral transgressions.
The PIOS predicts that the higher the score the more likely the individual will
punish first person moral transgressions greater than third person. The PIOS-S predicts
the opposite. This suggests that those who score higher on the PIOS are more critical of
their own moral transgressions and believe they deserve greater punishment as opposed
to someone else.
In contrast, scores on the PIOS-S correlate to increased willingness to punish
other’s moral transgressions more than their own. Those high in PIOS versus PIOS-S
were the same on first person but different on third person.

Discussion
The PIOS-S and PIOS differently predict punishment scores on first versus third
person moral transgressions. This may be because of the second underlying construct
that the PIOS/PIOS-R measures which the PIOS-S does not, FOG.
Higher scores on the PIOS correlated with a slower increase in punishment
ratings for third person moral transgressions. In other words, higher scores on the PIOS
correlated with more lenient punishment ratings for third person moral transgressions,
but not for first person moral transgressions. This may be related to the effects of
believing in a higher power, or a morally superior entity that passes judgement. If one
believed in a righteous god, then severity of terrestrial punishment may seem

redundant. Additionally, another explanation could be that for some faiths it is
considered sinful to pass judgement on others.
It is notable that both scores on PIOS and PIOS-S positively correlated with
severity of punishment for self and others. This suggests a relationship between
Scrupulosity and judgement of moral transgressions. More specifically, scores positively
correlated with harsher judgements of moral transgressions, supporting our initial
hypothesis.
Conclusion
In Part I, I compared Scrupulosity to both extreme altruism and psychopathy. In
Part II, I described our survey studies conducted up to this point. What I have learned
through this project is how much more research can be conducted around Scrupulosity.
I am eager to follow up on first versus third person moral transgressions. The
preliminary data is promising and can direct future research.
Another direction for future research is to examine the exploratory factor
structure of the PIOS-R in Christianity, other major religions, agonistics and atheists. We
did collect such information in our sample; however, the sample size was not large
enough to further separate the subjects into groups for data analysis based on religious
affiliation. What’s more, there were several religious groups which were not represented
in our data due to the sample pool. This may be amended by reaching out to different
subject pools and by emphasizing research outside of predominantly Protestant
Christian countries or regions.
In our research we collected demographics about religious affiliation, but the
sample size was not conducive to breaking the samples into smaller groups for
comparing religious affiliation with scores on the PIOS and PIOS-S. For now, our data
suggested that Christian and non-Christian populations score significantly different on
the PIOS and PIOS-R scale developed by Abramowitz et al at UNC.
Previous findings support the reliability of the PIOS for certain religious faiths,
e.g. Jewish, Christian, and Muslim samples (Inozu, Keser, & Karanci, 2017; Piruntinsky
& Rosmarin, 2018; Witzig & Pollard, 2013).
In a recent study, Huppert and Fradkin 2016 found the PIOS reliable at
distinguishing between Christians with, and Christians without, religious obsessions
(Huppert and Fradkin 2016). The authors also found that this effective distinction was
not replicable for other religious affiliations (i.e., Jews and non-religious patients). Hale
and Clark (2013) had similar findings suggesting a positive correlation between total
PIOS and POIS sub-scales scores and the self-reported importance of religion in the
subject’s lives (Hale and Clark 2013).
Even more recently while preparing my final paper I came across a publication
from June which addressed some of the very concerns we had with the religious items
on the PIOS and PIOS-R (Philips and Fisak 2020). The authors research adeptly shows a
gap between Christian and non-Christian scores on the PIOS-R. In particular, most
atheists surveyed (77.8%) selected “0” for all of the FOG subscale items (Philips and
Fisak, 2020). This suggests the FOG subscale has limited utility in atheists participants,
supporting our hypothesis that a secularized PIOS-R/PIOS would be applicable to a
greater variety of people.
Furthermore, Philips and Fisak found the same factor loading for an atheist
sample taking the PIOS-R as Abramowitz et al, 2002 and Olantunji, 2007. This is exciting
because the items which load as FOS/FOI are secular and the items which load on FOG
are specifically religious. The findings by Philips and Fisak also suggest that although
with the atheist population a second factor still bears out, the average score on the FOG
versus FOI subscale is significantly lower, once again supporting the futility of the FOG
subscale in atheist populations (Philips and Fisak, 2020).
The timing and contents of Philips and Fisak’s publication is both informative
and exciting. Informative because their research pairs well with the studies we
conducted, exciting because although our research is not identical it does hint at
replicability in our studies.
Overall, Scrupulosity evokes questions about moral responsibility and incentives
for moral action. Follow up projects would examine the influence of Scrupulosity
behaviors (symptomology) on moral decision making and judgements and perceptions
of others moral decisions.
The results of these studies warrant continued experimentation. Moreover, since
Scrupulosity is a mental disorder, future research should be conducted with clinical
samples. Additionally, follow up studies should continue to work to validate the PIOS-
S and examine the relationship between PIOS-S and convergent and construct validity.
We acknowledge some research limitations for these studies. It must be noted
that results based on this data set are low powered to restricting the variety of data
analysis we can run as well as significant correlations. However, the data serve as a
starting point for hypothesis synthesis and direction for further research studies.
Additionally, sample size limited what kinds of analysis could be run on the
data—for example, we could not control for specific religious affiliation when running
correlational regressions. Our goal is to eventually gather more data to test the validity
of a secular PIOS scale.
