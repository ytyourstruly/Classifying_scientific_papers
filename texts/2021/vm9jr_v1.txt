Construct Validity and Psychometric Properties of T-MoCA
Abstract
Background: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a neuropsychological cognitive
tool developed and adapted widely in various languages for screening mild cognitive
impairment (MCI).
Objectives: The present study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Tamil
(India) Version of MoCA (T-MoCA) and further examine the construct validity of the tool.
Method: The authors conducted internal consistency, test-retest, sensitivity-specificity, and
construct validity using 233 Tamil-speaking elderly participants. The inclusion criteria of the
study participants were 0.5 or less than 0.5 scores in the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR).
Further, T-MoCA was used to screen MCI.
Results: The result showed that the T-MoCA had high internal consistency (0.83) and high
test-retest reliability (0.92). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses showed an area
under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 (95% CI 0.87-0.94) for detecting MCI. Furthermore, the optimal
cut-off score to detect MCI was 24, accommodated a sensitivity and specificity of 88.4% and
77.9%, respectively.
Conclusions: The Tamil (India) version of the MoCA maintained its core diagnostic
properties, furnishing it a valid and reliable tool for the screening of MCI. Also, its latent
dimensions help to understand the elders’ cognitive function in a better way.
