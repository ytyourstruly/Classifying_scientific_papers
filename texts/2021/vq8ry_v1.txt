Abstract
How do perceptions of one’s relative economic status affect beliefs regarding gender roles?
We conducted a 2019 survey experiment with approximately 2,000 adults in Nepal. Em-
ploying an established survey treatment called a priming experiment to subtly alter half of
respondents’ perceptions of their relative economic well-being, we find that increased feel-
ings of relative deprivation make married women significantly less likely to support gender
egalitarian perspectives. Women decrease their support for women making decisions over
household expenditures, having equal control over household income, sharing household
chores, and women working outside the home. A message randomly read to some women
and designed to spur increased support for women’s empowerment does little to alter beliefs
regarding gender roles or to attenuate the effects of the relative deprivation prime. Despite
the negative impacts on women’s gender attitudes, however, we do not find a similar pattern
among married men. The results underscore the deleterious effects that feelings of relative
deprivation can have on women’s own gender attitudes and provide a cautionary tale given
trends toward greater economic inequality further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
The impacts of economic vulnerability on male backlash—or the extent to which men raise op-
position to the empowerment of women—are theoretically ambiguous. In particular, backlash
may not apply equally to all facets of gender equality. For example, in a context of limited
economic opportunity, compared to a context of abundance, the perception of women seeking
social advancement might appear to be a relatively greater threat to men (Inglehart and Flana-
gan, 1987; Andersen and Fetner, 2008; Morgan and Buice, 2013), strengthening opposition to
women’s empowerment. Yet the same lack of economic opportunity may simultaneously make
men more inclined to support women’s economic participation—with a motive of increasing
economic resources to thus lower economic anxieties for them and their families (Kosec et al.,
2021). Given that economic vulnerability is growing in many contexts (Ravallion, 2014), and
has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to understand when economic
anxieties cause greater or less support for different facets of gender equality.
Extant research indicates that individuals evaluate their economic conditions compared to
others around them (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Levy, 2003; Bendor, 2016). As such, this
trend toward increased inequality may mean that economic anxieties have risen in lockstep with
inequality among those being left behind. The salience of inequality has also been rising, in
large part as a result of the proliferation of information technology and the increasing preva-
lence of migration. Both trends have led to a broadening of the reference group against which
individuals compare themselves, resulting in a larger subset of the population feeling relatively
deprived. Recent research has shown that while feelings of relative deprivation may prompt
support for women’s economic participation—which can raise income for a household and thus
lower economic anxieties—they could also incite greater intra-household tensions (Kosec et al.,
2021). If men perceive a status threat in addition to relative economic deprivation, they may be-
come increasingly hostile towards actions to promote gender equality. That is, threats to their
economic status may make men more intent on holding on to their greater decision-making
power vis-a-vis women in the household.
In this paper, we use a novel data collection effort covering 2,011 households in 8 districts of
Nepal during February–April 2019 to examine whether feelings of relative economic deprivation
affect attitudes toward women’s role in the household. As our outcomes generally relate to
attitudes about women’s decision-making power in the household, we primarily focus on married
individuals for which all individuals have some chance of making the decision (e.g., as opposed
to an unmarried daughter who is likely closed out of many decisions), and interactions between
spouses are likely to affect women’s roles in decision-making. We utilize a relative deprivation
priming experiment that provides us with exogenous variation in individuals’ perceptions of
their relative economic status. Specifically, half of respondents are assigned to receive a relative
economic deprivation prime and half are assigned to not receive it, allowing us to make causal
interpretations regarding how the prime shifted gender attitudes.
We find that being made to feel relatively deprived (i.e., receipt of the poverty prime) leads
married women, but not married men, to become less supportive of women’s decision-making
power in the household. Effect sizes are fairly large. Among married women, we find a 0.0194
unit or 0.17 standard deviation decline in our Gender Egalitarian Index, which we use to assess
the overall degree to which married women’s gender attitudes are egalitarian. Specifically,
when women perceive that their household is in a relatively lower position compared to others
in their neighborhood, they become less likely to believe that women and men should have equal
ability to decide how to spend their household income and equal control over their household
income, less likely to believe that women and men should share household chores, less likely
to support women working outside the home, and somewhat more likely to uphold traditional
values. Some attitudes were stickier than others, such as attitudes on women supporting their
husband’s opinions and views on young women needing to follow tradition. In other words,
the deprivation prime did not shift these attitudes. These results suggest that feeling relatively
deprived leads women to be more willing to give up intra-household bargaining power on more
practical matters, but does not fundamentally change their attitudes about how women should
behave vis-a-vis their husbands or whether young women should continue to uphold tradition.
In addition, we test whether the effects of relative deprivation are moderated by gender
egalitarian messages. We find that the messages have negligible effects on shifting attitudes.
Married women who are induced to feel relatively poor held less egalitarian attitudes, even
after receiving messages that were intended to empower women. The messages also failed to
shift married men’s attitudes. Further, these messages did little to attenuate the effects of the
relative deprivation prime. It is important to note that the egalitarian messages failed to pass
our manipulation check question, which asked the extent to which women are provided with
different economic and social opportunities than men. Thus, it is possible that the messages
were too weak for us to detect any effects. Yet, our results are consistent with a recent study
which uses a stronger women’s empowerment intervention (McKelway, 2021), and therefore
provide evidence that women’s empowerment interventions are ineffective in shifting attitudes
on intra-household gender dynamics.
The Case of Nepal
Why examine the issue of intra-household bargaining in Nepal? In this section, we highlight
the key characteristics of Nepali politics, economics, and society that shape intra-household
bargaining in the country. To do this, we first discuss recent political developments in Nepal,
specifically with an eye to their gendered elements. We then provide an overview of the status
of women in the country, including detailed discussion of the state of the literature on intra-
household bargaining in Nepal. We conclude this section with a focus on the specific issue of
migration: it defines so much of life in Nepal today, such that any reflection on gender, including
intra-household bargaining, would be incomplete without serious discussion of the phenomenon.
Politics and Gender in Nepal
Nepal is a new democracy. Until 2008, it was a Hindu monarchy which, from 1996 until 2006,
battled a Maoist insurgency that ravaged the country. This conflict claimed the lives of an
estimated 13,000 individuals, and resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands more
(Adhikari and Samford, 2013; Joshi, 2013). The conflict ended in 2006 with a peace accord
between unified Maoist factions and the monarchy that led to a democratic election and, two
years later, dissolution of the monarchy and formation of the Federal Democratic Republic
of Nepal (Grossman-Thompson and Dennis, 2017, 801). Since the abolition of the monarchy,
the Maoist political party (Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist) has dominated Nepali elections,
along with the liberal democratic Nepali Congress party and the Communist Party of Nepal-
Unified Marxist Leninist (Hachhethu and Gellner, 2010).
The Nepalese Civil War had a profound impact on gender relations in the country. Indeed,
women played an active role in combat during the decade-long conflict (Pettigrew and Shneider-
man, 2004), and gender equality lay at the heart of the demands the Maoists made throughout
the conflict (Grossman-Thompson and Dennis, 2017, 801; Grossman-Thompson, 2019, 343).
Many of these demands have made their way into the formal policies that shape Nepali
politics today. For instance, Nepal’s 2015 Constitution guarantees gender equality in all spheres
of life, including in education, work, and wages. A number of quotas guarantee female political
representation at various levels of government. For instance, at the lowest administrative level,
the ward (equivalent to a county in the United States), two of the four ward members must be
women (Asian Development Bank, 2020, 3). In each district, which is one administrative level
higher than the ward, three of the nine members must be women (Asian Development Bank,
2020, 3). Throughout the state, including elected bodies and political parties, there must be
33% representation of women (Hachhethu and Gellner, 2010, 142). Perhaps one of the most
powerful signs of the success of some of these policies is the fact that the current president of
Nepal, Bidhya Devi Bhandari, elected in 2015, is a woman.
Yet in many ways, formal policies in Nepal continue to serve as significant obstacles to gender
equality in the country. For instance, one of the Maoists’ specific grievances tied to gender was
the fact that under the constitutional monarchy, only Nepali men could pass on citizenship to
their children or foreign-born wives (Grossman-Thompson and Dennis, 2017, 802).
While this issue has been debated in the context of new drafts of Nepal’s constitution,
this specific issue has not been resolved in post-conflict Nepal. One significant barrier to its
resolution is tied to nationalist sentiment and the threats that bordering India and China both
pose to this small landlocked country. Placed in this geopolitical context, Nepali women are
portrayed as possible threats to the Nepali state, particularly if women living on the borders
of India or China have children with Indian or Chinese men and thus ”contaminate” Nepal
with their offspring (Grossman-Thompson and Dennis, 2017, 810) We highlight this specific
example to underscore the fact that gender inequality continues to be enshrined within the
letter of the law in Nepal. This can be seen in many areas of the law, including inheritance,
property ownership, and legal claims-making, where the law consistently discriminates against
women (Kunreuther, 2009). In fact, according to some accounts, formal laws and policies are
in fact increasingly encroaching on women’s rights over time, rather than expanding upon them
(Grossman-Thompson, 2019).
Gender in Nepal: An Overview
Nepal is a patriarchal society with pervasive gender inequality and norms that discriminate
against women in all aspects of life. Women are discouraged from engaging in wage-earning
activities, and urged to focus their attention on child-rearing and household chores. They
are perceived to be temporary members of their families of origin (Bennett 1983): when they
marry, they leave their parental household to join their husband’s family. In contrast, sons
are considered permanent members of their family of origin (Grossman-Thompson and Dennis,
2017, 800). Menstruation is deeply stigmatized, and in some parts of the country menstruating
women are required to sequester in an isolated shed. Although the practice is illegal, it continues
to occur, with at times devastating consequences for the physical and mental health of those
who engage in it, including death (Adhikari, 2020).
These types of gender discrimination, deeply embedded in Nepali society, lie at the root of a
long list of quantifiable evidence that girls and women are not afforded the same opportunities as
men. Overall, women lag behind men in most indicators of gender equality in Nepal, including
in the areas of education, health, economics, and governance, and a female child born today
is less likely to live a healthy and empowered life than is a male child (Gurung, Pradhan and
Shakya, 2020, 157).
For instance, while 10% of men in Nepal are illiterate, 33% of women are (Asian Development
Bank, 2020, 9). For every 100 employed men, there are only 59 employed women. The average
monthly income for a woman is about 5,900 Nepali Rupees (50 USD) less than for a man—about
30% lower. And 76% of respondents in one survey reported that women earn less then men for
the same job (Gurung, Pradhan and Shakya, 2020, 76). In line with the gender quotas discussed
above, more than 40% of elected local officials are women, and more than one third of those
in state and federal assemblies are women (Asian Development Bank, 2020, 7). Yet women are
under-represented in government services and often confined to less prestigious positions: they
hold 10% of gazetted (higher ranked and more stable) positions, and 17% of those that are not
gazetted (and therefore less secure). Women also constitute only 3% of the highest civil service
positions (Special Class) (Asian Development Bank, 2020, 10).
Moreover, gender violence is a serious problem in Nepal. Indeed, 48% of Nepali women
The average monthly salary in Nepal in 2020 was 20,000 NRS, or 165 USD.
report having experienced violence over the course of their lives, and 27% of women in the
country report having experienced physical violence (Khatri Chhetri, 2020b). Strong social
norms resist reporting such abuse—among women who experience it, two-thirds report not
sharing their experience with anyone (Asian Development Bank, 2020, 7).
These inequalities find echoes in many of the attitudes that Nepali men and women espouse
towards gender. For instance, a study found that less than 40% of Nepali men and women
hold egalitarian views toward household chores. Instead, they overwhelmingly believe that a
woman’s most important role is to take care of her home and family; that a woman loses the
respect of her family or community if she does not carry out her domestic chores properly; and
that it is shameful for a man to carry out chores such as sweeping the floor, or washing dishes
or clothes (Gurung, Pradhan and Shakya, 2020, 137-138). Men and women also hold gendered
attitudes toward appropriate social behavior of men/boys versus women/girls (for instance,
expectations about submission to authority, modesty, and assertiveness) with only about 27%
of people holding them to egalitarian standards (Gurung, Pradhan and Shakya, 2020, 137-139).
In contrast, Nepalis hold relatively egalitarian views when it comes to perspectives on gen-
dered economic roles. For instance, over 70% of men and women disagree with the following
three statements: women should not go for outside employment if the household economic con-
ditions are better; when women work (outside the home for cash), they are taking jobs away
from men; and it is shameful if a wife earns more than her husband (Gurung, Pradhan and
Shakya, 2020, 137).
There are other positive signs to consider as well, such as a gender parity index (GPI) of 0.99
for enrollment in early childhood development programs, and 0.95 for school and college atten-
dance (Gurung, Pradhan and Shakya, 2020, 136). More generally, indicators of gender equality
have risen steadily in recent years (Grossman-Thompson, 2019, 344). And in some spheres of
life, women are in fact more active participants in their community than men. For instance, one
study found that women are more involved in local organizations than men (Gurung, Pradhan
and Shakya, 2020). This is likely due to the growth of community groups throughout the coun-
try that work with women on a variety of different issues and that have been found to increase
a sense of agency and empowerment amongst participants (Shah, 2004; Pradhan, 2011).
Viewed comparatively, Nepal ranked 101st out of 153 countries in the 2020 Global Gender
Gap Index rankings (World Economic Forum, 2020). Considering sub-rankings, Nepal was
153rd for economic participation and opportunity; 133rd for educational attainment; 131st for
health and survival; and 59th for Political Empowerment (World Economic Forum, 2020).
Of note, our paper is focused on the overall status of women in Nepal. Yet much of the
inequality that we describe varies according to the caste/ethnicity of women in the country. For
instance, while the dominant Hindu caste/ethnic groups tend to see the lowest rates of female
market employment, Dalit and Muslim women are more likely to work in the marketplace
(Lokshin and Glinskaya, 2009, 15). In contrast, Dalit and Muslim women tend to hold less
egalitarian views on gendered economic roles than do Brahmin and Newari women. While
recognizing these important intersectionalities between caste/ethnicity and gender, our focus in
this paper is on the shared experiences of inequality that are a defining feature of Nepali women
regardless of their diversity of backgrounds.
Gender in Nepal: Intra-Household Bargaining
Turning specifically to the issue of intra-household bargaining, married women in Nepal have
some decision-making power in the household. According to the 2016 Nepal Demographic and
Health Survey, most of them have sole or joint decision-making power about their own health
care (58%), visits to family and friends (56%) and decisions about major household purchases
(53%) (International Organisation for Migration, 2019, 107). Yet women in Nepal participate
less in decision-making than men, have less control over resources, and experience limits to their
freedom of movement (Gurung, Pradhan and Shakya, 2020, 142; Asian Development Bank, 2020,
7).
Alarmingly, women’s decision-making power in these realms appears to have decreased from
2011 to 2016 (International Organisation for Migration, 2019, 107). In line with these findings,
the NSIS (Nepal Social Inclusion Survey) found a decline in women’s participation in the sphere
of economic decision-making: women who can decide on disposal of self earned income (76% in
2012 versus 60% in 2018) and women who can decide on selling their own land and other assets
(25% in 2012 and 11% in 2018) (Gurung, Pradhan and Shakya, 2020, xxii). These developments
signal the need for increased attention to drivers of women’s empowerment.
Yet other data suggest reasons to be more optimistic about women’s empowerment in the
household over time. For instance, the NSIS found extremely large increases in the following
variables from 2011 to 2018: more women noted that they decided or were consulted on their
marriage (61% in 2012; 75% in 2018); were consulted on the number of children to have (53%
in 2012; 86% in 2018); were allowed to go to local market without permission (64% in 2012;
87% in 2018); were allowed to go to their parents’ home without permission (47% in 2012; 79%
in 2018); and were allowed to attend formal meetings without permission (37% in 2012; 67% in
2018) (Gurung, Pradhan and Shakya, 2020, xxi).
Gender and Migration
We turn now to an issue that affects almost all aspects of Nepali politics, economics and soci-
ety: migration. The phenomenon is overwhelmingly male-dominated in Nepal, with important
impacts on women and intra-household bargaining.
Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world. By some accounts, about 20% of the pop-
ulation lives in poverty (International Organisation for Migration, 2019, 28), and this provides a
crucial driving force behind migration out of the country. Indeed, an estimated 7% of the pop-
ulation is “absentee” (not living in Nepal)—one of the figures often used as an estimate of the
size of the migrant population (International Organisation for Migration, 2019, 35). According
to the 2011 census—the most recent one to have been conducted in the country—almost half of
households in Nepal had a member currently or returned from working abroad (International
Organisation for Migration, 2019, 2). Of note, Nepal does not track migration to India, which
has an open border with Nepal, or migration elsewhere that starts through India. Such records
do not exist (International Organisation for Migration, 2019, 3). The 2011 census found that
about 37% of individuals absent from Nepal were in India (International Organisation for Mi-
gration, 2019, 2-3). As such, actual rates of migration are likely substantially higher than these
formal numbers indicate (Phadera, 2019, 5).
Formal remittances from this migration make up about 25% of the country’s GDP (Kha-
tri Chhetri, 2020a, 92). Notably, these data do not include informal financial transfers, which
This open border policy allows Nepalis (and Indians) to cross into the other country and work there or carry
out any other activities without any papers. In the words of two scholars of Nepal, “it is a border that, in many
of the modern understandings of the term, is not a border.” (Hachhethu and Gellner, 2010, 136-137).
are considered sizeable, although specific data on their volume is unavailable (Khatri Chhetri,
2020a, 92).
As noted above, cross-border labour migration from Nepal is overwhelmingly a male phe-
nomenon. According to official Nepal government data, in the past decade, women have been
granted only between 5% and 8.5% of government labor approvals in any given year (Kha-
tri Chhetri, 2020a, 12). This gendered imbalance in migration is the direct result of migration
policies that perpetuate gender inequality in Nepal. Indeed, while Nepali men face relatively
few barriers to migrating abroad, in the past 20 years women have faced a constant flow of shift-
ing cross-border migration restrictions. In 2003, all women were required to receive permission
from both their family and the local government if they wanted a foreign labor work permit
(Grossman-Thompson, 2019, 345). Five years later, all women were prohibited from leaving
Nepal for employment in Malaysia and the Gulf countries. This ban was briefly lifted in 2011,
only to be quickly reinstated the following year.
The 2012 reinstatement banned women specifically under the age of 30 from migrating to
Gulf countries, particularly for employment as domestic workers. In 2014, the ban expanded to
once again include women of all ages seeking domestic work employment abroad. The following
year, women aged 24 and above were permitted to migrate to the Gulf countries, if their children
were over the age of 2. As of 2021, all women are once again forbidden from migrating abroad.
The gendered imbalance that these policies foster has resulted in a dominant narrative
wherein Nepali women are often characterized as having been “left behind” by male migrants
(Grossman-Thompson, 2019, 339). Yet, while these policies have certainly complicated efforts
of women to migrate abroad, that does not mean female migration is non-existent in Nepal.
First, the open border with India means that women encounter no regulatory obstacles to going
there. Second, women can migrate illegally to any number of other countries. It is difficult
to accurately measure the size of Nepal’s female cross-border migrant population: the open
border policy with India complicates efforts to monitor India-Nepal border traffic, and the
illegal movement of women elsewhere similarly evades the formal procedures in place to track
movement of Nepali citizens.
These policies, framed in paternalistic terms as designed to protect Nepali women from

those that enter the country through unapproved channels, including smuggling (Khatri Chhetri, 2020a, 95).
encountering harm, are deeply problematic from the perspective of gender equality in Nepal.
Indeed, given levels of poverty in Nepal and limited opportunities for lucrative employment
domestically, the fact that the law makes it so difficult for women to access jobs abroad is an
instance of state-perpetuated gender discrimination that essentially reserves the most well-paid
and sought-after jobs for men. Furthermore, these rules increase the migration risks for those
women who seek employment abroad in violation of the law. They are unable to access the
protective measures and state support that come with the labor approval process, such as Nepali
government verification of the legitimacy of the foreign employment offer and registration with
authorities who keep track of the migrant’s whereabouts and can provide assistance as needed
(International Organisation for Migration, 2019, 22).
What is the impact of migration on married women who remaint behind? In addition to
continuing to manage child-rearing and household chores, wives of migrant men often take on
unpaid responsibilities tied to family agricultural plots and enterprises that husbands had pre-
viously managed (Lokshin and Glinskaya, 2009, 3). Of note, absent husbands do not necessarily
provide greater freedom for wives to enter the formal work force outside the home. For instance,
one study found that “male migration has a negative impact on the level of MWP (market work
participation) by the women left behind” (Lokshin and Glinskaya, 2009, 4), a finding that others
have confirmed and elaborated upon, such as Phadera (2019) who finds that “[m]ale-dominated
migration pushes females to give up wage-employment and increase labor supply in their own
farms” (Phadera, 2019, 4). Even when husbands are abroad, they continue to participate in
major household and financial decisions (International Organisation for Migration, 2019, 107).
Absent husbands often uphold Nepali society’s strong norms that oppose female employment
outside the home, and their local family members and neighbors help reinforce these views
(Lokshin and Glinskaya, 2009, 3). There is also evidence that left-behind wives are on the re-
ceiving end of more sexual harassment and abuse than women whose husbands are by their side
(International Organisation for Migration, 2019, 107). Overall, there is no consensus in the lit-
erature on whether male migration has overall more positive or negative impacts on the women
left behind (International Organisation for Migration, 2019, 105-106; Asian Development Bank,
2020, 10).
Of note, as married women in Nepal are perceived to have left their family of origin and joined that of their
husband, when a husband migrates his wife falls under the control of her parents-in-law (Sharma, 1986).
Research Design
Data Description
Surveys were conducted between February 9, 2019 and April 1, 2019. Study participants were
randomly selected in the targeted study locations in Nepal to be representative of eight dis-
tricts clustered around Kathmandu in the Central Development Region, which is one of seven
provinces in Nepal: Sarlahi, Dolakha, Sidhupalchok, Kavrepalanchok, Bhaktapur, Dhading,
Makwanpur, and Chitwan. The survey consists of 2,011 individuals, uniformly distributed
1. The survey was conducted as part of a longitudinal study that involved three rounds of data
collection. The initial sample was representative of two regions in Nepal, the Central Develop-
ment Region and the Mid-Western Region. In each of ten districts, eight Village Development
Committees (VDCs) were selected, as well as two wards within each VDC, for a total number of
160 research sites. Wards that had fewer than 100 households at the time, as well as those that
were not primarily Nepali speaking, were excluded from the selection process. Wards within a
VDC were then selected, being mindful to avoid, when possible, two wards that share a border.
Individuals were recruited in Round 1 to achieve gender balance and age balance with respect
to a youth and non-youth population (half being between 13-24 years old; and half being 25+
years old). The second and third rounds of the survey targeted all respondents who participated
in Round 1 of the study in the Central Development Region, which translates to 8 of the 10
original study districts.
The survey employed tablets using the SurveyToGo offline data collection survey platform.
The questionnaire took approximately 1.5 hours to complete. The relative deprivation exper-
iment and women’s empowerment narrative experiments were embedded in the survey, and
randomization was automated at the individual level by the SurveyToGo program.
Nepal is divided into 75 districts.

Relative Deprivation Prime
In order to assess the effects of relative deprivation, we leverage a relative poverty prime that
Mo (2012, 2018) first employed to study the effects of perceived inequality on political and
economic behavior. The prime was originally developed by Haisley, Mostafa and Loewenstein
(2008) to study the decision to participate in lotteries. Mo (2012, 2018) introduced a variation
on that prime to study the effects of feeling relatively poor on attitudes and behavior which
Healy, Kosec and Mo (2017) and Fair et al. (2018) replicated in Pakistan, and which Kosec
et al. (2021) replicated in Papua New Guinea.
About half of respondents were randomly assigned to receive a priming question inducing
them to feel relatively poor, and thus perceive the income distribution to be wider than it
actually is. Hereafter, we refer to this group as the “relative poverty prime” group. The
remainder of the respondents received an alternative priming question, designed to frame their
household’s income neutrally and make them perceive the income distribution to be narrower
compared to the treatment group. Hereafter, we refer to this group as the “no poverty prime”
group. To operationalize the prime, we ask all respondents the following question: “Income
is the amount of cash income you earn from all agricultural and non-agricultural activities,
the cash value of any crops you produced, and money you receive from governmental or non-
governmental programs. How much income did your family earn last month?” We then randomly
assign respondents to receive one of the following two sets of response options and ask them to
Response Option No Poverty Prime Relative Poverty Prime
1 Less than NRS 3, 000 Less than NRS 25, 000
2 NRS 3, 000 − 6, 000 NRS 25, 000 − 50, 000
3 NRS 6, 000 − 9, 000 NRS 50, 000 − 100, 000
4 NRS 9, 000 − 12, 000 NRS 100, 000 − 200, 000
5 More than NRS 12, 000 More than NRS 200, 000
Notice that someone whose family makes NRS 7, 000 per month on average would choose
response option 3 if assigned to the control condition, whereas the same person would select
response option 1 if given the treatment condition. The logic of this prime derives from previous
research showing that response options to ordinal or interval questions send cues to respondents
about what are normal or typical responses to a question (e.g. Courneya et al., 2003; Menon,
Raghubir and Schwarz, 1997; Rockwood, Sangster and Dillman, 1997; Schwarz et al., 1985). In
this case, respondents may assume that the five response options were purposely selected so that
response 3 is the modal, or most typical response. As such, receiving the treatment condition
(poverty prime) may induce the respondents to feel as if their income is in the bottom part of
the income distribution, and see the income distribution to be wider than it actually is. The
other half of the respondents, who are assigned to the control condition, will be made to feel
that their income is more typical, and that the income distribution is narrower. This is because
we selected brackets such that those who receive the relative poverty prime is likely to select
response option 1, whereas those who do not receive the relative poverty prime are relatively
equally likely to answer with any of the five response options.
Gender Egalitarian Messages & Perceptions of Threat
In addition to the relative poverty prime described above, we introduce a messaging experiment
where respondents are randomly assigned to receive one of four sets of messages. The first
is the control group, in which respondents are not read any statements; instead, they are
immediately asked to respond to questions about their gender attitudes. The second group
(which we refer to as the “pure treatment group”) is read a statement that both describes the
disadvantages that women face and also underscores that many people want to bring about
gender equality. Two additional groups get the same gender narrative as the pure treatment
group, in addition to one more sentence. The third condition (which we refer to as the “less
threatening prime”) is designed to make respondents feel that women’s advancement can also
benefit men, making gender equality appear less threatening to men. The fourth condition
(referred to as the “more threatening prime”) says that many people support employers in
Nepal using policies and programs to remove barriers to women’s employment and “level the
playing field” with men. This prime could make gender equality seem more threatening to men
3.

to defer to men. They are also taught to put their needs and wishes behind
those of others at home and in the workplace, which reduces their self-worth
and limits their ability to progress in life. Some people say this standard
of behavior should change and women should have the same rights and op-
portunities as men. They say that women should belong in all places where
decisions are being made, and that their involvement will benefit society.

Summary of Measures
Outcome Measures
Each of our eight questions was designed to capture perceptions of gender equality and norms
pertaining to women’s decision-making authority in the household (i.e., questions relating to
intra-household bargaining). For each question, respondents were provided with five response
options, and for all analyses, we recoded responses to range between 0 and 1 for ease of inter-
pretation. Moreover, all responses were coded such that higher values represented more gender
egalitarian viewpoints.
overall index for married men and women separately. On average, we find that men and women
have similar gender attitudes; the mean of the overall index, computed by taking an average of
the eight outcome measures, is around 0.62 for both genders. Men are slightly more egalitarian
than women in their attitudes about the extent to which women should follow tradition and
do what their husband asks, while women are more egalitarian than men for outcomes related
to women’s role in decision-making over expenditures and income, and their working outside
the home. Perhaps most surprising is that while both genders have quite egalitarian gender
attitudes about women making decisions about spending income and working outside the home
(outcome value for these are always above 0.89 for both genders), they have very regressive
attitudes related to women needing to follow tradition and support their husband’s opinions
(outcome values for these are always below 0.37 for both genders).

the money their household earns from farming and other work? [1=A great deal, 2=A lot, 3=Moderately,

statement? Women should be able to work outside the home if they want to. [1=Strongly agree, 2=Moderately

or disagree with the following statement? Women and men should have equal control over income their household
earns. [1=Strongly agree, 2=Moderately agree, 3=Neither agree nor disagree, 4=Slightly disagree, 5=Strongly

household chores. [1=Strongly agree, 2=Moderately agree, 3=Neither agree nor disagree, 4=Slightly disagree,

should follow tradition, especially women. [1=Strongly agree, 2=Moderately agree, 3=Neither agree nor disagree,
4=Slightly disagree, 5=Strongly disagree]; and (7) To what extent do you agree or disagree with the following
statement? It is important for a woman to do what her husband asks, even if she disagrees with him. [1=Strongly

In our pre-analysis plan, we included a wider set of measures. Results for all of these measures are presented
in the Appendix. Additionally, we registered that we would standardize using the mean and standard deviation in
the control group. We instead standardized the items to range between 0 and 1 to allow for ease of interpretation.
This deviation from our pre-analysis plan does not change our results.

Manipulation Check Measures
The following questions were developed to assess whether the treatments had their intended
effects. For the relative poverty prime, we expected that those who were randomized into the
treatment group to feel poorer compared to those in the control group. To capture this, we asked
all respondents the following question: “In your opinion, compared to others in your community,
is your household poorer or richer or neither poorer nor richer?” [1=Much poorer, 2=Moderately
poorer, 3=Slightly poorer, 4=Neither poorer nor richer, 5=Slightly richer, 6=Moderately richer,
7=Much richer]. We also expected that respondents who received a gender egalitarian message
would be more likely to believe that women in Nepal do not have the same economic and social
opportunities as men: “To what extent do women in Nepal have the same economic and social
opportunities as men?” [1=A great deal, 2=A lot, 3=Moderately, 4=A little, 5=Not at all].
As done for all outcome measures, we recoded all responses to range from 0 to 1. Summary
Data and Estimation Strategy
Estimation Strategy
Given our experimental design, we estimated the effect of the relative poverty prime on married
individuals’ gender attitudes using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression for all individuals,
and then separately for married men and married women:
(1)
A = α + βP + σX + φE + ρV + (cid:15) ,
i i i j k i
where i indexes individuals and P is a binary indicator denoting whether respondent i received
the poverty prime. The reference category or base group category in the specification is non-
receipt of the poverty prime. X is a vector of individual- and survey-level controls to improve
the precision of estimates. E are enumerator fixed effects for enumerator j, V are VDC fixed
j k
effects for VDC k, and (cid:15) is the error term. Note that as the study employs an experimental
design, we will consider both a specification without any control measures (X, E , V ) as well.
j k
We include control variables that we noted in our pre-analysis plan: gender (but not when conducting
analyses by gender), age, education, ethnicity, religious identification (Hindu and Buddhist), number of children,
household income, access to food, and household expenditures.
The outcome, A , represents individual-level gender attitudes that are expressed as the extent
of disagreement or agreement with or general support for statements related to gender norms
and women’s appropriate roles in the household and community.
Next, we estimate the effect of being exposed to a women’s empowerment narrative, the
effect of the relative poverty prime, and the interactive effects of exposure to a narrative and
the relative poverty prime on individuals’ gender attitudes. We again estimate the effects using
OLS regression for all married individuals and then separately for married men and married
women. We estimate the following empirical specification using
(2)
A = α + βP + γM + δP M + σX + φE + ρV + (cid:15) ,
i i i i i i j k i
where i indexes individuals, and M is a binary variable indicating whether the respondent
received a women’s empowerment narrative. P is a binary indicator denoting whether re-
spondent i received the poverty prime. The reference category or base group category in the
specification is non-receipt of any women’s empowerment message and non-receipt of the poverty
prime. The interactions are captured by coefficients δ.
Results
Balance Tests and Manipulation Checks
Before estimating treatment effects, we first conduct balance tests and manipulation checks.
When we examine whether demographic characteristics are balanced across our experimental
conditions, we observe that the randomization of the deprivation prime worked as designed (see
number of children, household income levels, food security, and household expenditure levels are
all statistically indistinguishable across the two experimental conditions. We also see balance
in observable demographic characteristics across our gender egalitarian message conditions (see
This consists of the “pure” women’s empowerment narrative, the “less threatening” women’s empowerment
narrative, and the “more threatening” women’s empowerment narrative. We registered in the pre-analysis plan
that we will pool the conditions if there is no evidence of each of the messages having differential effects.
We pre-registered all of the variables that we expected to achieve balance on. Information on respondents’
monthly household income, ethnicity, religion, and educational level are taken from first round of the longitudinal
data, as they were not asked again in this round of the data collection effort.
Through two tests, we are able to confirm that our relative deprivation treatment worked
as intended. First, we considered whether the relative deprivation prime influenced the income
bracket selected by the respondent (ranging from 1 through 5, with higher brackets indicating
higher household income). Reassuringly, we observe that those who were primed to feel relatively
poor chose a lower income bracket than those who were not primed to feel relatively poor.
demographic controls as well as enumerator and VDC fixed effects, the relative deprivation prime
translated to the respondent being over two brackets lower in the distribution we provided—a
result that is statistically significant in both cases at the 0.01 level. When we flexibly allow
the relative deprivation prime to have different impacts according to respondent gender, we find
some limited evidence that the prime affects women less than men; this difference is insignificant
in a specification not including covariates (β = -0.07; p = 0.57; see column 2) and it is significant
in the specification including them (β = -0.21; p = 0.06; see column 4). Overall, however,
the magnitude of the interaction term (β = -0.209) between the relative deprivation prime
and gender is small compared to the coefficient on the deprivation prime itself (β = -2.189),
indicating similar impacts across genders.

prime translates to a depressed view of one’s relative economic status—specifically, a 16.7 per-
centage point (pp) decline in our measure of subjective economic status when we do not include
covariates (p = 0.038; see column 1). This is equivalent to about a 0.105 standard deviation

the measure (p = 0.016; see column 3). Moreover, whether or not we include covariates, we
cannot reject the statement that the prime had the same impact on women than it had on men

The empowerment narrative, however, did not have the intended effect. None of the messages
led to a substantive or statistically significant shift in respondents’ perceptions that women are
in the Online Appendix). When we pool the three treatment conditions together, we still see no
substantive or statistically significant shift in responses when looking at all married individuals

decline in responses among married women and married men when we do not include covariates
(p = 0.334; see column 1 of the top panel) and a 0.968 pp (or 0.051 S.D.) decline in responses
when we include covariates (p = 0.393; see column 2 of the top panel). To observe a change in
gender attitudes with regards to intra-household bargaining, reduction in a denial that there are
inequities is a necessary first step. However, we do not see such a change. Indeed, it is possible
that our message was too weak; however, it is noteworthy that people are not responsive to a
subtle message regarding how women and men are treated differently in society, whereas people
are sensitive to subtle relative deprivation primes. In other words, people are sensitive to some
subtle treatments. Moreover, as showcased in a recent study in India, McKelway (2021) finds
that an intervention to empower women and encourage households to have women work outside
the home that is stronger than the one we used, as she uses a video to display benefits of women’s
advancement visually rather than through a simple text-based message, is ineffectual. She finds
that the video-based treatment does not change broader attitudes about how women need to
be afforded more opportunities. It appears that people are generally impervious to nudges to
improve gender dynamics between men and women. Given that we do not see evidence of our
women’s empowerment message increasing recognition that women need to be afforded more
rights and opportunities to be equal to men, we expect that the message has no effect on our
outcome measures of interest.
Main Effects
As we would expect given the gender egalitarian message did not have the intended effect of
increasing concern for women’s opportunities, as measured by our manipulation check question
described above, we see no effect of any of the gender egalitarian messages on our outcome
measures among both married women and men (β = -0.0003 - 0.008, p > 0.10; see columns

messages on our outcomes of interest is a precise null, rather than estimating main effects and
interactions, we focus on the main effects. In other words, rather than employing Equation
(2) that reflects our factorial design, we focus on Equation (1) and simply control for the
receipt of a message (whether we control for receipt of each of the three messages separately
or control for receipt of any of the three messages does not matter) to estimate the effect of
the relative deprivation prime. Note that when we employ Equation (1) rather than Equation
(2), the estimated treatment effect of the relative deprivation prime is an average of the effect
when people receive our gender message and the effect when people do not receive our gender
message; however, as there is no effect of the gender message, this is a non-issue. The advantage
of this empirical strategy is the fact that we obtain a larger number of respondents in both our
“control” sample (i.e., those who did not receive the relative deprivation prime) and “treatment”
sample (i.e., those who received the relative deprivation prime), which meaningfully shrinks the
size of our standard errors.
We find consistent evidence that perceptions of relative deprivation lead women to be in
favor of ceding their power to their husband in intra-household bargaining decisions, but have
Gender Egalitarian Index, which is a simple mean of the eight sub-components we consider, we
observe a 0.0194 unit (p = 0.008) decline among married women. This is a rather large effect,
reflecting an approximate 0.17 standard deviation (S.D.) decline in the degree to which married
women’s gender attitudes are egalitarian. This index is our primary measure of interest for two
reasons. First, by focusing on one key outcome, we mitigate against multiple hypothesis testing.
Second, an advantage of an averaged measure is that it nets out measurement error associated
with any one of the index components (Ansolabehere, Rodden and Snyder, 2008).

“every individual should follow tradition, especially women” (β = −0.0447, p = 0.052; hereafter
referred to as our “tradition” measure). The effect sizes for individual index components are
moderately large in standard deviation terms. Specifically, they reflect a 0.13 S.D. decline in
our expenditure measure, a 0.19 S.D. decline in our income measure, a 0.20 S.D. decline in
our share household chores measure, a 0.17 S.D. decline in our work measure, and a 0.13 S.D.
decline in our tradition measure. That these effects are all large and similarly-sized suggests
that none dominates our overall effects. Consistent with the aforementioned patterns, we also
see greater agreement with the sentiment that “it is important for a woman to do what her
husband asks, even if she disagrees with him”; however, this effect is not statistically significant
at conventional levels (β = −0.0244, p = 0.346; hereafter referred to as our “does what husband
asks” measure).
We observe null effects for questions pertaining to whether “a good woman always supports
her husband’s opinions” (β = 0.0070, p = 0.705; hereafter referred to as our “supports husband’s
opinions” measure) and whether “it is important for young women to abide by traditions, and
behave like their mothers’ generation” (β = 0.0039, p = 0.835; hereafter referred to as our
“young women follow tradition” measure). It is important to flag that the latter question
clearly refers to young women (who may be unmarried), whereas respondents would likely
answer the other seven questions with reference to older women (who are in marriages and thus
more likely to be weighing in on intra-household decisions). As such, it may be less relevant for
our index—though we include it given we pre-specified it as being included in our index.
In contrast, we observe no changes in gender attitudes among men depending on whether or
consider the index, we estimate a precise null effect (β = 0.0056; p = 0.469). Reassuringly, we
observe a null effect for each of the eight component measures as well. Given this pattern, we are
not surprised to see that the difference in the observed effect of the prime between women and
men for our overall index measure is statistically meaningful (β = -0.0251; p = 0.020; column 1
which we identified statistically significant impacts of the prime on women (for income (column
3), share household chores (column 4), work (column 5), and tradition (column 6) measures; see
with respect to intra-household bargaining in response to the relative deprivation prime, men’s
attitudes do not shift, and we can also statistically reject that impacts on women and men are
the same.
Discussion
This study contributes novel experimental evidence from over 1,500 married adults in Nepal on
how perceptions of one’s relative economic status influence beliefs regarding gender roles in the
household. It uses an established survey treatment called a priming experiment to subtly lead
half of respondents to feel that their household’s income is relatively low, which we refer to as
experiencing relative deprivation, while others are left feeling relatively neutrally about their
household’s income. We focus on married women and men in order to better capture intra-
household bargaining that occurs among spouses. We find that increased feelings of relative
deprivation make women significantly less likely to support gender egalitarian perspectives.
Women decrease their support for women making decisions over household expenditures, having
equal control over household income, sharing household chores, and women working outside the
home. A message randomly read to some women and designed to spur increased support
for women’s empowerment does little to alter beliefs regarding gender roles or to attenuate the
effects of the relative deprivation prime. Despite the negative impacts of the relative deprivation
prime on women’s gender attitudes, however, we do not find a similar pattern for men.
These results present an interesting contrast with those of Kosec et al. (2021). In Papua New
Guinea, these authors—like us—primed half of both men and women to experience increased
feelings of relative deprivation. They did not employ any women’s empowerment narratives.
They found that some aspects of gender attitudes are sensitive to perceptions of relative poverty.
Specifically, feeling that one’s household is relatively poor increases support for women’s paid
employment among both men and women. This might be interpreted as evincing a potential
upside to feeling relatively poor; at least in low-income and highly gender unequal contexts such
as that of PNG, some norm-based constraints limiting women’s labor force opportunities might
be relaxed when individuals feel economically worse off. However, they simultaneously find two
troubling effects. First, focus group discussions highlighted that support for women’s increased

economic participation would not alleviate their unpaid domestic and care work. Instead,
feeling relatively poor elicits more support for women “doing it all”—generating income outside
the home without reneging on any of their usual household chores. This accords with more
recent feminist scholarship showing that increasing women’s economic participation is not by
itself empowering. Also, women who experienced feelings of relative poverty believed that they
should be more involved in intra-household decision-making. Men, at the same time, did not
want to alter the status quo regarding who makes decisions, which suggests that feelings of
relative poverty can create conditions ripe for intra-household tension.
What might explain these contrasting findings? Nepal and PNG differ in that Nepal has
a higher likelihood of male (as opposed to female) labor supply adjustments in response to
worsening economic conditions given the availability of migration—which is male-dominated in
Nepal. Thus, where households faced with income shortages in PNG may rely more heavily on
women engaging in paid employment, those in Nepal may instead respond with male migration—
which is known to be lucrative, but which men may refrain from when possible due to the mental
health toll it is often takes (Chen, Kosec and Mueller, 2019). When households deal with
income shocks through increased labor supply by women, women may seek additional decision-
making authority in the household and adhere less to traditional gender roles. However, when
households adjust to income shocks through male migration, women may face increased domestic
workloads, be under the thumbs of in-laws, and cede power to avoid within-household conflict.
Overall, the results of both studies underscore the deleterious effects that feelings of relative
deprivation can have on women. In PNG, they appear to increase the potential for within-
household conflict over decision-making and saddle women with additional work. In the context
of Nepal, they appear to lead women to cede decision-making authority to men, possibly due to
a perceived increased need to fulfill traditionally female roles in response to either male absence
or to prevent conflict or violence.
The results also underscore the necessity of repeating experiments in different country con-
texts to assess how well the outcome of a study can be expected to apply to other settings
(i.e., external validity). Our contrasting findings from performing the same priming experi-
ment in two different country contexts with similar levels of economic and human development
showcase the importance of rigorous testing of patterns across multiple country contexts. An
interesting area for future research relates to precisely what are the economic conditions that
explain different reactions to the same primes. That is, substantive questions that remain to
be analyzed—possibly via studies that provide more variation in the underlying economic con-
ditions of respondents—regarding whether our hypotheses for the reasons that results differ
somewhat in PNG vs. Nepal are correct, or whether there are other important explanations for
differences in findings.
Our study is not without limitations. More work is needed to understand the extent to
which shocks to feelings of relative deprivation achieved by us via a survey experiment are
sufficiently similar to shocks perceived from real-world events (e.g., economic decline, job loss,
prices changes, natural disasters, etc). There may also be better ways to elicit gender attitudes
than simply asking questions—which may be susceptible to a variety of response biases that
could generate noise in our outcome variables (e.g., desirability bias, wherein individuals offer the
response they think enumerators want to hear). For example, presenting vignettes describing
particular real-world scenarios or offering list experiments may result in more thoughtful or
truthful replies.
