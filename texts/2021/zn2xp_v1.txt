Abstract
Background: A worldwide vaccination program is the chosen strategy
against the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccine hesitancy however, forms a threat
because vaccine uptake is voluntary in most countries. Care-professionals of
people with intellectual disabilities are exposed to greater risks than other
healthcare workers due to the vulnerable group they attend to and the
assisted-living facilities in which they often work. Little is still known of the
reasons for vaccine hesitancy in this specific group in contrast to those of
other healthcare workers.
Objective: To provide insight in the intentions and attitudes on COVID-
vaccination of healthcare workers, including those who care for people with
intellectual disabilities, by means of a scoping review.
Methods: The databases that were searched for papers are CINAHL, APA
PsycArticles, APA PsycInfo, Web of Science, Semantic Scolar, Prospero,
Outbreak Science, Cochrane and Scopus. The search was broadened to
healthcare workers in general because only two papers were found on those
caring for people with intellectual disabilities. A total of 26 papers were
identified concerning the vaccine intentions of 43,199 healthcare workers
worldwide. Data were gathered both quantitively and qualitatively. The papers

Insights in vaccination intentions of healthcare workers
were analysed for all themes regarding vaccine willingness and vaccine
hesitancy.
Results: The themes that came to light included: percentages of vaccine
willingness, predictors of willingness differentiated by 11 sub-themes (mainly
profession, age, gender and past vaccine behaviour), attitudes of willingness
and hesitancy differentiated by 19 sub-themes (perceived COVID treat and
protecting others for willingness, concerns on vaccine safety and efficacy for
hesitancy), sources of vaccination information, contextual factors and
changes in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance over time and finally, future
strategies for interventions.
Conclusions: There was overlap in the percentages of vaccination,
predictors of vaccine willingness and the attitudes of vaccine willingness and
hesitancy between healthcare workers and those caring for people with
intellectual disabilities. Vaccine safety and efficacy are the most prominent
concerns with regard to vaccine hesitancy. Therefore, future strategies for
interventions should address vaccine safety and efficacy. Furthermore,
interventions are recommended to be interactive in order to facilitate
exchange. Discussion groups that are able to address specific concerns and
personal experiences, show to be effective in addressing vaccine hesitancy.
Accurate information can also be made more accessible to target groups by
promoting video’s on social media platforms. Hence, further research is
necessary to specify more precisely the attitudes of healthcare workers caring
for people with intellectual disabilities and in more countries worldwide.

Insights in vaccination intentions of healthcare workers
What is already known
• Worldwide vaccination programs are the primary strategy to overcome
the COVID-19 pandemic, but vaccine hesitancy stands in the way of a
high degree of vaccination.
• Healthcare workers caring for people with intellectual disabilities face
heightened risks during the COVID-19 pandemic above and beyond
the risks other healthcare workers face, but limited literature is
available concerning the attitudes on COVID-vaccination of this specific
group.
What this paper adds
• This paper provides insights into the key themes in the available
research on COVID-19 vaccine intentions of healthcare workers, and
those caring for people with intellectual disabilities, which are:
percentages of vaccine willingness, predictors of willingness, attitudes
of willingness and hesitancy, sources of vaccination information,
contextual factors and changes in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance over
time and finally, future strategies for interventions.
• Predictors of COVID-19 vaccine willingness among all healthcare
workers were profession, age, gender and past influenza vaccine
behaviour; drivers of vaccine hesitancy for COVID-19 in this group
were concerns on vaccine side-effects, vaccine safety (e.g. pregnancy
related concerns), vaccine efficacy and speed of vaccine development,
but more research is necessary on healthcare workers that care for
people with intellectual disabilities and on healthcare workers in
continents such as Africa, South America and Australia.
• Suggestions are made for future interventions in order to improve
vaccination intention worldwide and addressing trust related issues of
the vaccination programs, such as especially focussing on vaccine
safety and efficacy, and addressing concerns of those that are hesitant
by making interventions more interactive as well as by increasing
information quality on social media platforms.

Background
Vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 started worldwide in December
2020 and are the primary strategy to tackle the pandemic. Along with
vulnerable population groups, such as the elderly and individuals with
vulnerable health, healthcare workers were prioritised to be vaccinated for
several reasons. One reason is the heightened occupational risk healthcare
workers are exposed to because they care for vulnerable population groups
(Giubilini et al., 2020), who are more prone to COVID infections.
Consequently, healthcare workers are at greater risk of direct exposure to the
virus. Other reasons to prioritise healthcare workers are to prevent them from
infecting the patients they care for, and to keep healthcare workers fit to work
where they are most needed as frontline workers (Giubilini et al., 2020).
Healthcare workers who care for people with intellectual disabilities
face a heightened risk due to the group they attend to and the specific
conditions in which this group lives. Some studies have reported excess
mortality rates among people with intellectual disabilities (Joy et al., 2020;
Landes et al., 2020; Williamson et al., 2021). In the Netherlands, for example,
Koks-Leensen et al. (2021) found that while 1.3% of the general population
intellectual disabilities is far higher: 4.6%. Besides showing that people with
intellectual disabilities who contract COVID-19 have higher death rates, these
studies (Joy et al., 2020; Koks-Leensen et al., 2021; Landes et al., 2020) also
show that people with intellectual disabilities are vulnerable as they often have
multiple additional medical comorbidities (Courtenay & Cooper, 2021).
Furthermore, people with intellectual disabilities have a higher chance of
infection (Gleason et al., 2021) as they often stay in assisted-living facilities
throughout their lives, where they, depending on the severity of their disability,
are cared for by a large number of healthcare workers. The higher the number
of individuals you are in contact with, the higher the risk for infection. Thus,
healthcare workers who care for people with intellectual disabilities could face
a higher risk of contracting COVID than other healthcare workers.
According to Randolph and Barreiro (2020), group immunity is
achieved when 67% of the population is vaccinated, but other research states
that group immunity thresholds are difficult to determine (Kadkhoda, 2021). It
is even likely that group immunity for COVID-19 may not be possible due to
new and upcoming virus variants. Since vaccine uptake is generally voluntary,
vaccine willingness plays a vital role in a successful vaccination campaign.
Vaccine willingness is often influenced by attitudes, beliefs and opinions on
vaccination, with low vaccine willingness being related to vaccine hesitancy
(Gagneux-Brunon et al., 2021). Therefore, it is important to investigate the
reasons and arguments for vaccine uptake or refusal. This is especially true of
healthcare workers caring for people with intellectual disabilities, given the
heightened risk they face. Several studies have investigated the factors
influencing vaccine willingness and vaccine hesitancy, such as beliefs and
attitudes towards vaccination. The systematic review on vaccine willingness
by Sallam (2021), reports on a total of 60 surveys taken from 31 published
papers. These studies were carried out globally in the general population and
in different target population groups like healthcare workers, students and
parents. The surveys analysing the general population (N=47) found the
highest vaccine willingness rates in Ecuador (97%) and the lowest in Kuwait
Page | 4
Insights in vaccination intentions of healthcare workers
(23.6%). The surveys analysing healthcare workers (N=8) found the highest
vaccine willingness in Israel (78.0%) and the lowest in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC, 27.7%). Hence, a review study examining the
arguments for vaccine willingness and hesitancy of healthcare workers,
especially in the care of people with intellectual disabilities, can provide
important information for policy makers in order to reach the highest
vaccination degree possible among healthcare workers providing care for this
specific group of people.
To date, however, very few studies have explored the vaccine
willingness and hesitancy of healthcare workers in care for people with
intellectual disabilities and their attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. This
review aims to better understand vaccine willingness and hesitancy among
healthcare workers who care for people with intellectual disabilities by
identifying key themes in the available research. The research question is:
What factors contribute to vaccination hesitancy or willingness? Are
influencing factors of vaccine willingness and hesitancy of healthcare workers
who care for people with intellectual disabilities different from those of other
healthcare workers? The current study assesses these questions by
conducting a scoping review: thus, gathering all themes related to vaccine
willingness and hesitancy from the reviewed articles.
Methods
Design & Protocol
This scoping review aims to identify key themes in the literature
concerning vaccination hesitancy and willingness among healthcare workers
who care for people with intellectual disabilities. The 12-step guideline by
Kable et al. (2012) was used during the search strategy.
Eligibility criteria
Papers focused on COVID-19 vaccination willingness and hesitancy
amongst healthcare workers were included. Initially, the search focused on
healthcare workers who care for people with intellectual disabilities, but very
few papers met this criterium. Therefore, the scope was broadened to
healthcare workers in general. Pre-printed and published qualitative,
quantitative and commentary papers were included. There was no language
exclusion. There was no eligibility criterium for year of publication or
timeframe of data collection, but only papers dating from 2020 and 2021 were
available due to the search topic. Papers were excluded if they did not focus
on vaccination hesitancy or willingness amongst healthcare workers and their
corresponding attitudes, beliefs, perceptions or views.
Information sources, search strategy and selection process
The second author conducted the search on April 4th, 2021, in the
following databases: CINAHL, APA PsycArticles and APA PsycInfo (via the
EBSCO host), Web of Science, Semantic Scholar, Prospero, Outbreak
Science, Cochrane and Scopus. The following search terms (or an adjusted

version) were used: “Wuhan coronavirus*” OR “COVID19*” OR “COVID-19*”
OR “COVID-2019*” OR “coronavirus disease 2019” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR
“2019-nCoV” OR “2019 novel coronavirus” OR “severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2” OR “2019 novel coronavirus infection” OR
“coronavirus disease 2019” OR “coronavirus disease-19” OR “SARS-CoV-
2019” OR “SARS-CoV-19” AND “vaccine” OR “immunisations” OR
“vaccination” OR “vaccination schedule” AND “healthcare prof*” OR
“healthcare work*” OR “health personnel” OR “healthcare staff” OR
“caregiver” AND “intellectual disability” OR “learning disability” AND “belief”
OR “perceptions” OR “views” OR “attitudes” OR “opinions” OR “knowledge”.
An initial search on all databases included all search terms, however the
Semantic Scholar database was the only database that yielded results with
the search terms “intellectual disability” OR “learning disability”. Therefore, the
search was broadened and excluded these search terms in all other
databases. A second search was conducted in Semantic Scholar. This
resulted in the identification of articles related to healthcare worker
perceptions.
A total of 176 articles were identified in the database search, of which
166 remained after excluding duplicates. Three review rounds took place after
the initial search was completed. During the first round, a title screening
identified 82 relevant articles. The second round consisted of the abstract
screening and yielded 44 eligible articles. The final full article screening
resulted in a remainder of 27 articles, because three articles were excluded
based on relevance and 14 were unavailable for full-text review. Of the final
selection of 27 articles, only two covered the beliefs of healthcare workers of
individuals with intellectual disabilities. After critical appraisal by the first
author, one more article was excluded, resulting in a final number of 26

Data synthesis and analysis
Microsoft Excel was used for the following steps. First, the purpose of
each of the studies was extracted from the introduction texts. If present,
hypotheses were also extracted. Second, the methodology of each of the
Page | 7
Insights in vaccination intentions of healthcare workers
studies was extracted, including the type of research (cross-sectional
survey/qualitative appraisal/ systematic review) and the survey topics (e.g.
sociodemographic characteristics, vaccination intent, reasons for vaccine
hesitancy, etc.). Third, the samples of the studies were described: sample
sizes, type of participants/respondents (healthcare workers, general
population, students), group sizes and descriptors of participants (e.g. gender,
profession, age, level of education). Fourth, countries and time frame of data
collection were extracted. Time frame of data collection is important in this
case because vaccination willingness/hesitancy may change over the course
of the pandemic. Finally, the results and/or conclusions of the studies were
gathered and organised in themes and sub themes. These themes are (1)
percentages of vaccine willingness, (2) predictors of willingness differentiated
by 11 sub themes, (3) attitudes of willingness and hesitancy differentiated by
19 sub-themes and (4) sources of vaccination information. Two more themes
that will be discussed directly in the discussion section of this review are (5)
contextual factors and changes in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance over time
and (6) future strategies for interventions.
After the second author conducted the search, the first author
independently reviewed all 27 papers in the final selection for eligibility by
making a full-text screening. Nioi et al. (2020) was omitted from the final
selection after consultation with all authors, resulting in the final number of 26
papers. Although this paper covers future challenges in the vaccination
campaign specifically towards healthcare workers because there is no current
data on its long-term safety, it does not cover vaccine hesitancy or willingness
amongst healthcare workers and their attitudes on the subject. Because
Sallam (2021) is a systematic review, the results of the current review will be
compared to those found by Sallam (2021) in the discussion section of this
paper. The commentary by Gur-Arie et al. (2021) discusses vaccine hesitancy
among healthcare workers and the ethical issues of mandatory COVID-19
vaccination and will also be reviewed in the discussion section.
Next, all the themes extracted from the papers by the second author,
were reviewed by the first author. All authors came to a consensus about the
themes identified. There was one alteration of a category: Contextual Factors
now also includes Changes in COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance over Time.
Two attitudes were merged and one theme was rearranged in order to make a
more concise overview of themes.
Results
First, the results section will describe the general characteristics of the
literature. Then, a more precise description will follow of the vaccination
intention across samples in the literature. Next, the predictors of vaccine
willingness will be discussed: the socio-demographical characteristics of
respondents. Finally, the attitudes on vaccine willingness and hesitancy will
be discussed. These attitudes are different from the predictors because they
are not demographical characteristics: attributes that are descriptors of the
respondents. The attitudes on vaccination intention are better described as
thoughts, beliefs, or opinions: attributes that are susceptible to change.

Characteristics of the literature
The screening for papers on the topic of COVID-19 vaccination
willingness and hesitancy amongst healthcare workers yielded a total of 26
articles that mainly consisted of cross-sectional surveys (n=22). The
remaining four papers were respectively, a report of cross-sectional qualitative
meetings1, a commentary7, a rapid qualitative appraisal14, and a systematic
review21. Characteristics of the papers included in this review are presented in
all tables. The data contained in the included papers had been gathered in 16
different countries worldwide, spread out over the continents of Africa, Asia,
Europe, North America, or a combination of two continents. The time frame of
data collection of these papers was between February 2020 and March 2021.
Sample sizes ranged from 24 respondents in the rapid qualitative appraisal14
to 16,158 respondents in the cross-sectional survey15. These samples were
split into the following groups of respondents: Healthcare workers (HCW),
Healthcare workers op people with intellectual disabilities (HCW ID), Family of
people with intellectual disabilities (Family ID), General Population and
Medical Students; followed by the percentage of that group willing to be
vaccinated. Additionally, in 12 papers2,3,4,5,9,11,17,18,19,22,23,26 the group of
healthcare workers was differentiated by health professions within the health
care system, as can be seen in the Respondents column. Their corresponding

The difference in vaccine willingness across samples
Only two papers8,13 reported about healthcare workers in the care for
people with intellectual disabilities. In both papers, healthcare workers
showed a comparable percentage of vaccination intention; 76% and 82%.
Iadarola et al. (2021)8 focused not only on healthcare workers who care for
people with intellectual disabilities, but also individuals diagnosed with
intellectual disabilities and family members of people with intellectual
disabilities (e.g., individuals who spend time with people with intellectual
disabilities and make decisions for them). Vaccine intentions did not
significantly vary across these three groups.
A total of 21 papers reported percentages representing vaccine
willingness amongst healthcare workers. These percentages differed
drastically across papers, ranging from only 27.7% in one paper9 to 82.95% in
another23. The 13 papers that differentiated vaccine willingness across
various health professions will be further explained in the following section
predictors of vaccine willingness.
Not all papers reported exclusively on vaccine willingness of healthcare
workers, but also included the willingness of other populations3,4,8,21,23,26. Of
the papers that reported about healthcare workers in comparison to the
general population, some mentioned significantly higher vaccination
willingness percentages for healthcare workers compared to the general
population23,26, while others found no statistically significant difference
between these groups4,8 and one found that doctors and the general
population were more willing to get vaccinated than nurses3. In an additional
paper24, the vaccination willingness of medical students (i.e. future healthcare
workers) was compared to that of non-medical students, with significantly
higher percentages for the medical students.
Predictors of vaccine willingness
The theme predictors of vaccine willingness was split into 13 different
respondents that predict vaccine willingness. Not all sub-themes are a
Profession, age, past vaccine behaviour and gender are statistically
significant predictors in eight papers or more. The predictors will be described
in order of frequency, but only statistically significant predictors in at least five
papers. Sub-themes that were statistically significant predictors in less than
five papers were not discussed. These include comorbidities, education,
ethnicity, mental well-being, COVID self-history, geographical location,
COVID-family-history, income, and political orientation.

Insights in vaccination intentions of healthcare workers
Type of profession was questioned in 18 papers and significantly
predicted vaccine willingness in 12 papers2,3,4,5,9,11,17,18,19,22,23,26. Physicians or
medical doctors had higher vaccine willingness than other healthcare worker
staff in 11 of those papers. Szmyd et al. (2021 (a)3) reported vaccine
willingness as high as 94.44% among physicians (MD), whereas only 61.48%
of administrative healthcare assistants (HA) were willing to get vaccinated.
One paper11 differed from the rest of the results: physicians were associated
with lower vaccine willingness than nurses, other healthcare workers and
Age also significantly predicted vaccine willingness. Age was
questioned in 21 papers, and was a statistically significant predictor in ten
papers2,8,9,11,12,13,16,18,22,26. Older age predicted higher vaccine willingness in
most papers 8,9,13,16,22,26, but not all. Three papers2,11,12 reported younger age
to predict vaccine willingness. Finally, vaccination intention was highest in age
groups under 40 and over 60 years old in one paper18.
Both past vaccine behaviour and gender predicted vaccine willingness
frequently and consistently. A total of 10 papers2,3,5,11,18,20,22,23,24,25 out of 13
reported that past influenza vaccine behaviour predicted vaccine willingness
significantly; having received the influenza vaccine corresponded with higher
vaccine intentions. A total of eight papers3,5,9,11,18,20,22,26 out of 21 reported that
gender predicted vaccine willingness; being male corresponded with higher
vaccine intentions.
Attitudes on vaccine willingness and hesitancy
Eighteen different subthemes focusing on the attitudes related to
vaccine willingness and hesitancy have been extracted from the 26 selected
willingness or hesitancy and were categorised into five overarching themes:
health factors, ethics, trust related issues, information, and practical factors.
Attitudes or beliefs that consistently corresponded with vaccine
willingness were (1) threat of COVID, (2) desire to protect family members, (3)
vaccination should be mandatory, (4) vaccination is a collective responsibility
and (5) vaccination being part of one’s profession. These attitudes fall under
the themes of Health Factors and Ethics. The most frequently occurring
attitude in favour of vaccine willingness was the perceived COVID threat:
fifteen different papers reported that an increased perception of COVID threat
was associated with higher vaccine willingness. Six papers reported that
attitudes toward protecting family members, vaccination being part of the job,
and collective responsibility were associated with vaccine willingness. Finally,
the belief that vaccination should be mandatory was measured and linked to
vaccine willingness in two papers. Here, healthcare workers were more willing
to get vaccinated than other groups of participants and thought more often
that vaccination should be mandatory.

Insights in vaccination intentions of healthcare workers
Attitudes or beliefs that consistently correspond with vaccine hesitancy
hesitancy fall under the theme Trust related issues, one under the theme
Information and four under the theme Practical factors. The attitude
associated with hesitancy most often was fear of short or long-term side
effects; this was the case in 17 papers. Additional concerns reported in ten or
more papers that fall under the category Trust related issues were the
vaccine's safety, speed of development, and efficacy. Distrust was observed
in several forms: distrust of the vaccine itself, distrust of the government, of
the pharmaceutical companies or distrust of health authorities/officials.
Another attitude associated with vaccine hesitancy was lack of information or
misinformation; this was the case in nine papers. Examples of where
information was lacking were (1) the vaccine in general14, (2) the benefits of
vaccination26, (3) on vaccine development2,18, (4) on the financial interest of
pharmaceutical companies11 and (5) on vaccine side effects11. The spread of
misinformation across traditional and social media was established in three
qualitative papers1,14,23 and three quantitative papers9,16,26. Finally, four
attitudes that corresponded with vaccine hesitancy fall under the theme of
Practical factors. The attitude of favouring alternative (herbal or organic)
treatments over vaccination was linked to hesitancy in three papers. Impact
on other precautions, logistics to get vaccinated, and spirituality/religion were
all linked to hesitancy once.
Information sources of COVID-19 and vaccination
In some papers, vaccination distrust and vaccine hesitancy were linked
to the sources used by respondents for COVID-19 vaccination information.
For instance, Di Gennaro et al. (2021) reported that the use of Facebook as a
primary source of information on COVID-19 vaccination was a statistically
significant predictor for higher vaccine hesitancy. In Mohamed Hussein et al.
(2021) the prime sources of information of respondents were social media
(77%) and television (40%), and according to the authors this was a reason
for the low percentage of vaccine willingness in their sample, which was
45.9%. Additionally, a positive relation between vaccine hesitancy and
distrusting the ministry of health was found by Verger et al. (2021). They
reason this distrust to be a major problem since the ministry of health is the
primary information source of COVID-vaccination to both healthcare workers
as the general population.
Other sources of information on COVID-19 than Facebook or social
media were linked to vaccine willingness. Attending lectures/discussions
about COVID-19 and using official websites were, amongst other variables,
significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Kabamba Nzaji
et al. (2020). Similarly, Yurttas et al. (2021) describe that although social
media and television were the most common information sources in both the
general population and in healthcare workers, healthcare workers also
frequently consulted institutional declarations and medical literature, which
might have caused their higher vaccine acceptance.
Discussion

Insights in vaccination intentions of healthcare workers
This scoping review aimed to examine the key themes in the available
research on COVID-19 vaccine willingness and hesitancy in healthcare
workers, including those who care for people with ID, with a specific interest in
their arguments, beliefs and attitudes on vaccination. A total of 26 papers
were selected and analysed, focusing on the socio-demographical predictors
of vaccine willingness and the attitudes that inspire vaccine hesitancy in
healthcare workers. Only two papers were found that focussed on healthcare
workers working with individuals with intellectual disabilities (Iadarola et al.,
2021; Lunsky et al., 2021). Vaccine willingness percentages were comparable
between the respondents of these two papers and within the subgroups of
these papers.
In the two papers that describe vaccine hesitancy in healthcare workers
that care for people with intellectual disabilities (Iadarola et al., 2021; Lunsky
et al., 2021), the main socio-demographical predictor of willingness was age,
with younger people being more hesitant for vaccination. Other socio-
demographical characteristics like profession, gender, ethnicity, education
and geographical location were not statistically significant predictors of
vaccine willingness. In Iadarola et al. (2021), there was however an
interaction effect between age and ethnicity: in both Black and White
respondents, those over the age of 50 were less vaccine hesitant than their
younger counterparts. In Asian and Latin/Hispanic respondents this age
difference was less strong. The respondents that were hesitant to get
vaccinated in Iadarola et al. (2021) were most concerned by the possible side
effects of the vaccine and its fast development. Not wanting to be an
experiment and not trusting the government were the follow-up reasons for
vaccine hesitancy, and these opinions were strongest in Black respondents.
The respondents that were hesitant to get vaccinated in Lunsky et al. (2021),
believed more strongly than those willing to get vaccinated, that ‘a vaccine
was unnecessary because of good health’, but also distrusted the vaccine
because of its fast development and potential side effects. Alternatively, these
respondents believed less strongly than those willing to be vaccinated, that
they were at risk to get COVID, that a vaccine would protect their family or
clients, or that vaccination was a part of their job. Comparing the outcome
measures of these two papers reveals the similarities between the
respondents: age being the sole predictor of vaccine willingness and concerns
of the vaccines’ side effects and its fast development inspiring vaccine
hesitancy.
As a result of the limited literature available on healthcare workers that
work with people with intellectual disabilities, the scope of this review was
broadened to all healthcare workers. As a result, in the following steps the
analyses included healthcare workers of any kind. First, the predictors of
vaccine willingness in all 26 papers were analysed. This analysis revealed
that profession, age, gender, and past-vaccine behaviour were the most
powerful predictors of the willingness to be vaccinated: medical doctors,
people of older age, men, and those previously vaccinated with the influenza
vaccine were most likely to also receive the COVID-vaccine. Our findings
suggest that nursing staff, people of younger age, women, and those not
previously vaccinated are the target populations when aiming to inform
healthcare workers of the benefits of vaccination. The results of this review
partly support those found in the rapid systematic review by Robinson et al.
Page | 19 IJNS manuscript template (August 2021)
Insights in vaccination intentions of healthcare workers
(2021): people of younger age and women were more hesitant towards
vaccination in the general population. Additionally, Robinson et al. (2021)
reported higher vaccination hesitancy in people with lower income, people
with lower education and people belonging to an ethnic minority group. These
last three respondent groups were statistically significant predictors in only
one (income) or two (education and ethnicity) papers in this review.
Next, all COVID vaccine attitudes were categorized: firstly in theme,
secondly according to whether they contributed to either vaccine willingness
or vaccine hesitancy. Attitudes promoting vaccine willingness fit within the
themes of Health factors and Ethics. Some examples are the COVID threat to
oneself or the desire to protect family members or other persons. Attitudes
promoting vaccine hesitancy fit within the themes of Trust related issues and
Information. Examples of trust related issues are concerns on both short and
long-term side effects, the safety of the vaccine, efficacy and the speed of
development of the vaccine. Other examples are lack of information or
misinformation on the vaccine. This suggests that the themes that need to be
covered when providing interventions to inform healthcare workers about
vaccination are Trust related issues and Information. The findings of this
review complement those of earlier studies. Robertson et al. (2021) report in
the UK Household Longitudinal Study with over 12,000 participants, that the
main reason for vaccine willingness is reducing the risk of being infected by
COVID or getting ill from it (54.6%) while the main impediment to vaccination
is worries about the unknown future effects of the COVID vaccine (42.7%).
Interestingly, this paper also reported responses about persuasion. Factors
that would increase the likelihood of getting vaccinated according to
participants were knowing a vaccine reduced their risk of COVID-19 infection
(67.8%); knowing a vaccine reduced the risk of being seriously ill (63.7%);
and knowing the vaccine was proven to be safe (59.8%). In other words,
respondents expressed the need for more information on vaccine safety and
efficacy.
Finally, an analysis was done of the information sources used on
COVID-19 vaccination and their connection to vaccine willingness and
hesitancy. What sources are used to inform oneself on COVID-19 vaccination
can be of influence in deciding whether to get vaccinated or not. It seems that
sources like Facebook and other forms of social media are a breeding ground
for misinformation and even conspiracy theories, which in turn could lead to
vaccine hesitancy. Misinformation is often the basis on which distrust of the
vaccine is formed. Berry et al. (2021) explicitly state: “During town hall
meetings with 193 frontline staff from the skilled nursing facility workforce,
misinformation through social media was common: rapid vaccine
development and infertility and pregnancy related concerns were among the
most frequent raised.” They even state that the concerns raised are more
pervasive than some national polls might suggest. Thus, the spread of
misinformation through social media platforms, in both the general population
and healthcare workers, should be taken very seriously and could be
counterbalanced by targeted interventions such as information sessions on
actual vaccine information as well as the spread of more informative videos
on social media. Even though social media is the main source for
misinformation, this platform can also be used to make more accurate

Insights in vaccination intentions of healthcare workers
information, in easy to understand language, accessible to our target group,
and to the public in general.
It is important to note that vaccine intentions may not be stable over
time. Some papers collected data on the opinions of healthcare workers
before the distribution of vaccines worldwide in December 2020. Other papers
started collecting data after the onset of the mass vaccination program.
Contextual factors could have affected the vaccine willingness of
respondents. For example, O'Brien et al. (2021) collected data from
healthcare workers in the USA using a brief survey sent out in October 2020
(N=2070) and again in December 2020 (N=1541). The vaccine willingness of
respondents increased more than 20% over these two measurements. This
increase is in part due to the 998 participants that contributed to both
measurements and changed their vaccine intention between these two time
points: 2.9% changed from willing to hesitant, and 13% from hesitant to
willing. In these months two events occurred which may have had implications
on the respondents' vaccine willingness. The first event was the USA
presidential election which took place on November 3rd, 2020. The second
event was the release of phase III clinical trial results by two vaccine
manufacturers, after which both vaccines were approved for Emergency Use
Authorization (EUA). Similar results were found by Meyer et al. (2020): an
increase in daily recorded cases of vaccine willingness was reported after the
EUA release.
Besides the rise of vaccination intentions over time, it is also possible
that these intentions could decline. In Qattan et al. (2021), low rates are
explained by a decline in daily recorded COVID-infections, resulting in
alleviated worries. Similarly, Kwok et al. (2021) speculates that the relatively
low vaccination intentions in their participants are “in part explained by the
successful crisis response on the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong”. In other
words, there might be less feeling of urgency for vaccination among these
healthcare workers if alternative measures combat the pandemic well. These
results suggest that examining the population's vaccine willingness and
hesitancy is an ongoing matter, at least as long as the COVID-19 pandemic
has not ended. In addition, when running vaccine information campaigns,
contextual factors should be taken into account - e.g. new virus variants,
research related to this virus and ‘booster’ vaccine campaigns.
One interesting topic for future research is the difference between
vaccine intentions and actual vaccine receipt, as this would shed light on the
efficacy of vaccination campaigns. Most papers in this review report the
opinions of healthcare workers prior to the worldwide rollout of vaccines
December 2020, while others begin after the start of the mass vaccination
program. Because data collection by Oliver et al. (2021) started after
December 2020 in the USA actual vaccination uptake could indeed be
measured. Results show that 81% of responding healthcare workers had
received the vaccine at the time of survey, with an additional 11% of
respondents that planned to get vaccinated. Unfortunately, in Iadarola et al.
(2021) positive and negative answers were merged to Intend/Got and Do not
intend/Don’t know answers. Thus, even though some respondents had
already received the vaccine, actual receipt numbers could not be obtained. It
would be interesting to investigate if vaccine receipt numbers differed from
vaccine intention percentages.

Insights in vaccination intentions of healthcare workers
Although investigating the difference between vaccine intentions and
vaccine receipt was beyond the scope of the current paper, it does shed some
light onto the difference in being unwilling and undecided about vaccine
receipt. Some papers reviewed here not only gathered information about
vaccination willingness, but also specified what portion of the sample was
unwilling and what portion was undecided about vaccination intent. This is
al. (2021) for example, it becomes apparent that although vaccination intent
was not very high amongst healthcare workers (67%), vaccination non-intent
was only 7%. Thus, a substantial percentage of the sample could be
persuaded by appropriate interventions.
Two papers included in this review explicitly describe interventions that
were held to inform healthcare workers about COVID-19 vaccination. First,
online town hall meetings were organized by Berry et al. (2021) where
moderators and doctors met with the skilled nursing facility (SNF) workforce to
discuss COVID-19 vaccination. The qualitative report sheds light on the
concerns and questions of 193 healthcare workers on vaccination and
presents examples of the suggested answers by the moderators and doctors.
What is interesting about their approach is that these answers were personal
stories and experiences whenever possible, instead of data-focused answers.
Berry et al. (2021) conclude that “sharing positive emotions and stories may
be more effective than sharing data when attempting to reduce vaccine
hesitancy in SNF staff”. This may be due to the fact that these stories are
more relatable than statistics. This should also be taken into account in future
campaigns. Interventions should provide information in such a manner that
your target group can relate to it and make the idea of getting a vaccine less
clinical. Second, Gakuba et al. (2021) investigated the impact of a vaccine
information session on the willingness to get vaccinated among healthcare
workers. A 45-minute information session on the COVID-19 vaccine and
vaccine hesitancy, followed by a question-and-answer session, was delivered
by intensivists to 61 non-medical healthcare workers. Participants were
questioned about their vaccine willingness before and after the information
session: acceptance rates increased drastically from 56% to 82%. Both
papers address the importance of appropriate interventions that inform
healthcare workers and moreover, facilitate exchange with healthcare
workers, to improve their vaccination intent.
Another way of improving the vaccination rates among healthcare
workers worldwide could be to make vaccination mandatory, either for all
adults or just healthcare workers, as is already the case in some countries
(Stokel-Walker, 2021). Only one paper advocated for mandatory vaccination
and bases this solely on low vaccination intentions of certain respondents, but
not on ethical argumentation (Pădureanu et al., 2020). The question arises if
mandatory vaccination will solve the problem of low vaccination, or if this
would not merely increase distrust in vaccine hesitant healthcare workers.
Instead, Gur-Arie et al. (2021) argue to promote voluntary vaccination by
improving trust between healthcare workers and health institutions and
governments. To force individuals to vaccinate for COVID-19 when their
reasons not to vaccinate are due to safety concerns of the vaccine itself,
could have the opposite effect and could even lead to essential staff quitting
their jobs. Therefore, addressing the concerns raised would be a better way to
Page | 22 IJNS manuscript template (August 2021)
Insights in vaccination intentions of healthcare workers
build trust. One paper investigated which initiatives would increase
vaccination intentions for COVID-19 among their healthcare worker
respondents (Di Gennaro et al., 2021). These were: “increasing information
quality about the vaccine (40%)”, “increasing information quality about vaccine
development (28%)”, “implementing an economic incentive (21%)” and
“making vaccination mandatory (11%)”. Clearly, mandatory vaccination was
the least appealing option. Increasing information quality about the vaccine
and its development is mentioned in several papers that were analysed in this
review (Eguia et al., 2021; Iadarola et al., 2021; Kwok et al., 2021; Lunsky et
al., 2021; Mohamed Hussein et al., 2021; Qattan et al., 2021; Yurttas et al.,
2021). Increasing information quality can be achieved by interventions such
as lectures, information sessions, focus groups or online interactive meetings.
Increasing information quality can also be done in the form of spreading more
informative videos on social media: that is where most misinformation is
spread and where vaccine hesitant individuals get information (Eguia et al.,
2021; Kwok et al., 2021; Mohamed Hussein et al., 2021; Yurttas et al., 2021).
It seems that mandatory vaccination would not be ethically justifiable until all
other means have been tried and failed.
When looking at the different countries and continents where data was
collected in the selected articles of this review, it becomes apparent that
vaccine willingness among healthcare workers is lowest in Africa. Here,
average vaccine willingness was only 36%, while that of Asia, Europe and
North America ranged between 62% and 70%. Unfortunately, no papers were
included in this review with vaccine acceptance rates of healthcare workers in
South America or Australia. In the systematic review by Sallam (2021), Africa
is also among the regions with the lowest vaccine acceptance, together with
the Middle East and some European countries. A limitation of both this review
and that of Sallam (2021) is that only two surveys were found with vaccine
acceptance rates from the African continent. It is clear that more research is
necessary to investigate vaccine intentions of healthcare workers across the
globe to attain more insights in cultural differences, mainly in continents such
as Africa, South America and Australia.
In the results section of this review, we confined ourselves in describing
the socio-demographical predictors of vaccine willingness that were
statistically significant in at least five papers. Thus, the predictors that were
not described are comorbidities, education, ethnicity, mental well-being,
COVID self-history, geographical location, COVID-family-history, income, and
political orientation. Although these predictors were not significant very often,
some of these were not questioned in the selected papers. These predictors
may turn out to be statistically significant more often, if they were investigated
thoroughly. In order to examine the predictors of vaccine willingness, future
research should include possible parameters like mental well-being, COVID
family-history and political orientation, as these were statistically significant
most often in relative terms.
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of this paper include the large number of healthcare workers
in the selected papers. The number of participants was 49,775 in all papers,
of which 43,199 participants were healthcare workers, spread out over 16
Page | 23 IJNS manuscript template (August 2021)
Insights in vaccination intentions of healthcare workers
different countries worldwide. An additional strength was the inclusion of both
quantitative and qualitative papers. This resulted in both statistically
comparable figures as well as more in-depth insights into the attitudes of
vaccination hesitancy worldwide. A limitation of this scoping review is the
small number of papers found on the attitudes of vaccine hesitancy of
healthcare workers caring for people with intellectual disabilities. An
alternative would have been to broaden the search to long-term care for the
elderly in addition to people with intellectual disabilities, as healthcare workers
in these facilities generally share characteristics in terms of type and level of
education, organization of care, focus on quality of life. It would be interesting
to compare the similarities and differences of attitudes on COVID vaccination
between these groups. Another limitation is how the studies compared
healthcare workers to the general population. When predictors were identified,
it cannot be determined whether this was within healthcare workers
population alone or whether all respondents were merged (incl. general
population) in the statistics of the papers. Related to this, for predictors it
could be counted how often each factor was statistically significant. For the
attitudes this was unfortunately not the case. Finally, this paper reviews
papers that were found in April 2021. Given the variable nature of vaccine
intentions, the development of different COVID-variants and worldwide
‘booster’ vaccination programs, new research should be done quickly and
continuously on this matter.
Conclusions
In summary, it appears that vaccine hesitancy varies in healthcare
workers and is affected by contextual factors. We are led to the conclusion
that target populations to be addressed within the healthcare worker
population are nursing staff, people of younger age, women, and those not
previously vaccinated, due to their high levels of vaccine hesitancy. In order to
reach the highest degree of vaccination worldwide, it is vital to address the
problem of COVID vaccine hesitancy more effectively by providing personal
stories and experiences and by addressing vaccine concerns and questions.
Interventions in the form of information sessions (e.g. meetings, webinars,
discussion groups) concerning trust related issues of the vaccination
programs are highly recommended. Furthermore, the spread of more reliable
and accurate information about COVID-19 vaccination across social media
platforms in an attempt to decrease misinformation is also suggested.
Additional research is needed to specify more precisely the attitudes of
healthcare workers caring for people with intellectual disabilities in general
and in different continents more specifically.
