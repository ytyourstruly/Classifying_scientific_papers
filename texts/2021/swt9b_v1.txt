36 Abstract
37 It remains unclear when and why the ability to copy actions evolved and also its uniqueness
38 to humans. Thus far, a lack of valid evidence for spontaneous action copying by other apes
39 supports the view that only humans spontaneously copy actions. However, wild apes have
40 access to multiple demonstrators and have been demonstrated to be affected by majority
41 influences, thus raising the possibility that ape action copying might require a majority ratio
42 of demonstrators to observers. We tested for spontaneous ape action copying across all four
43 non-human great ape species using a demonstrator majority. Nineteen captive mother-reared
44 apes (across 4 species) were tested (Ra =9-52; M =18.63; ♀=14; ♂=5). All failed to copy
age age
45 the demonstrated actions, despite observing it in a majority influence condition. We conclude
46 that culture in non-human great apes is more likely supported by variants of social learning
47 which regulate frequencies, rather than forms, of observed behaviours.
48 Significance Statement
49 This research is presented at a time when the United Nations have recently placed an example
50 of ape culture as a factor to be conserved through protected heritage sites. There is no
51 question that ape cultures exist, but the nature of their culture remains in question. Our own
52 culture often relies on the ability to copy novel actions, it has been shown that some or all of
53 ape cultural variants do not require social learning, in any form, to occur in naïve
54 populations. However, the question remains, do great apes have the capacity to copy novel
55 actions? The answer to this question will allow us to draw phylogenetically informed
56 conclusions about our own evolutionary past.
59 Introduction
60 The cumulative cultural evolution of human behaviour has allowed our species to
61 populate an impressively wide range of habitats as well as manipulate our environments on
62 an unprecedented scale. Although cumulative culture has been defined in multiple ways, most
63 consider it to consist of changes in behavioural forms (or forms of artefacts) across time that
64 increase in complexity or efficiency, until they are beyond the learning capacity of an
65 individual to acquire in their lifetime (Boyd & Richerson, 1996; Tomasello, 1999).
66 Consequentially, one important social learning mechanism argued to be necessary for
67 cumulative culture is the ability to copy others’ behavioural forms, known as ‘action copying’
68 or ‘imitation’ (Galef, 1992; Tennie et al., 2009); though this does not mean that other
69 mechanisms are unimportant (Osiurak & Reynaud, 2020; Sperber, 2000). For clarity, here we
70 define imitation/action copying sensu (Whiten, 1998; Whiten et al., 2004; Whiten & Vallejo,
71 2016): that is, assuming imitation requires that the actions of a demonstrator/model are
72 copied, rather than the results (which would enter the realms of emulation). Novel action
73 copying appears necessary for many aspects of human cumulative culture, including some
74 aspects of ‘material culture’, but particularly for cultural practices that consist only of actions,
75 e.g. dances and sign languages (Legare & Nielsen, 2015). The term ‘material’ refers to those
76 cultural variants with physical results/artefacts (McGrew, 1991), and thus contrast with the
77 aforementioned action based practices.
78 It is necessary to consider whether the material culture of non-human great apes
79 (hereafter: apes) is based on action copying. The answer to such a question would provide an
80 indication of whether the last common ancestor of extant humans and apes was also capable
81 of action copying (Tennie et al., 2017). The first question is relevant to the ongoing, and now
82 somewhat classical, debate about the proposed uniqueness of human culture (contrast
83 Tomasello, 1998; Whiten & Custance, 1996). Whereas, the second question is relevant for the
84 more contemporary issue of determining the timeline of the emergence of cumulative culture
85 in our lineage and the evolutionary pressures shaping it (Stout et al., 2019; contrast Tennie et
86 al., 2017). From an evolutionary perspective, although the fossil record provides evidence of
87 the outcomes of material culture (e.g., stone tools), the social behaviours resulting in these
88 outcomes do not fossilise. Great apes, in this respect represent an important opportunity to
89 examine the cognitive and behavioural processes underlying material culture, by acting as
90 imperfect, but phylogenetically relevant ‘model’ for our ancestors.
91 Attempts have been made to identify the social learning mechanisms underlying ape
92 material culture, this has often resulted in the conclusion that action copying is a necessarily
93 underlies its transmission and maintenance (Boesch, 1991; Byrne, 2007; Whiten, 2000;
94 Whiten et al., 1999; Whiten & Vallejo, 2016). This said, an increasing body of evidence
95 indicates that many, if not all, social aspects of non-human material culture do not require
96 imitation (Bandini & Tennie, 2017; Menzel et al., 2013; Motes-Rodrigo et al., 2019; Neadle
97 et al., 2017; Tennie et al., 2008). The overwhelming conclusion of these studies is that
98 individual learning (catalysed by social information; so-called “socially mediated serial
99 reinnovations” Bandini & Tennie, 2017, p. 13) is sufficient to explain the specific forms of
100 ape cultural behaviours (see also Tennie, Bandini, et al., 2020). Given the controversy, the
101 question remains, are our closest living relatives capable of copying actions for material
102 culture? But also, and perhaps more importantly, if they are, what would be the socio-
103 ecological circumstances that would drive them to apply this specific social learning
104 mechanism?
105 There exist several theoretical explanations (see a recent review Osiurak & Reynaud,
106 2020) that attempts to harmonise the lack of imitative capacity in apes with the observed
107 geographical patterns in putative cultural traits (Hohmann & Fruth, 2003; Robbins et al.,
108 2016; van Schaik et al., 2003; Whiten et al., 1999)(Hohmann & Fruth, 2003; Robbins et al.,
109 2016; van Schaik et al., 2003; Whiten et al., 1999). However, various scholars have
110 questioned the idea of apes’ imitative capacities and imitation’s relevance to ape
111 cultures/traditions (Galef, 2015; Kendal, 2008; McGrew, 2002; Tennie et al., 2009; Tennie,
112 Bandini, et al., 2020). A theoretical account that dispels the idea of non-human imitation is
113 the Zone of Latent Solutions (ZLS) hypothesis (Tennie et al., 2009; Tennie, Bandini, et al.,
114 2020; Tennie, Hopper, et al., 2020). The ZLS predicts that, given appropriate social,
115 ecological and nutritional settings, individual apes are able to individually develop
116 (“reinnovate”; Bandini & Tennie, 2018) the forms required to express their material culture.
117 One prediction of the ZLS hypothesis is therefore that ape material culture should occur even
118 in the absence of action copying. A number of studies, from various research groups, do
119 indeed show that some forms of non-human material culture can be individually reinnovated
120 by apes in the absence of action copying or even any social learning (Bandini & Tennie,
121 2017, 2019; Huffman et al., 2010; Lonsdorf et al., 2009; Menzel et al., 2013; Meriel et al.,
122 2020; Motes-Rodrigo et al., 2019; Neadle et al., 2017; Sherry & Galef, 1984; Visalberghi,
123 1987).
124 This said, even the ZLS hypothesis does not suggest that non-imitative forms of social
125 learning are absent from ape culture (e.g., local enhancement or stimulus enhancement).
126 Instead of transmitting the behavioural form (“know-how”; Bandini et al., 2020), these social
127 learning variants – while often present – instead transmit other types of relevant knowledge:
128 for example, ‘know-where’ (e.g., where to find nuts) or ‘know-what’ (e.g., what type of
129 hammer to use). Whilst it is clear that social learning does occur in these instances (Eshchar
130 et al., 2016; Luncz et al., 2012), these mechanisms cannot convey information about the
131 ‘know-how’. ‘Know-how’ transfer either requires language (as in modern humans; Dunbar,
132 1996), form teaching (Tennie, Bandini, et al., 2020; Zwirner & Thornton, 2015) or the ability
133 for observers to copy the behavioural form itself – i.e., an ability to copy the underlying
134 actions (imitation; Tennie, Hopper, et al., 2020).
135 However, even in the absence of action form transmission (as expressions of ‘know-
136 how’), the transmission of other types of knowledge (e.g., ‘know-what’) has lasting effects on
137 the distribution of behaviours within populations and may even lead to approximations of
138 human culture (Caldwell & Millen, 2009; Reindl et al., 2017; Zwirner & Thornton, 2015).
139 These mechanisms can therefore explain the emergence and maintenance of the rich great ape
140 cultures we see today (Hohmann & Fruth, 2003; Robbins et al., 2016; van Schaik et al., 2003;
141 Whiten et al., 1999) and regulate the relative frequencies of expressed ‘know-how’ in apes,
142 but without the need to culturally transmit this ‘know-how’ itself (Bandini & Tennie, 2017;
143 Neadle et al., 2017; Tennie et al., 2009; Tennie, Hopper, et al., 2020). This view differs from
144 the ‘action copying hypothesis’ which claims that, in addition to these other types of
145 knowledge, apes also transmit the ‘know-how’ itself by copying actions (Whiten, 2017;
146 Whiten et al., 1999). Suffice to say, neither the action copying nor the ZLS hypothesis rejects
147 the existence of ape cultures. Where these accounts differ is in whether these cultural
148 patterns have been interpreted as direct evidence for a capacity for/reliance on action copying
149 by adherents of the ape action copying hypothesis (Boesch, 1991; Byrne, 2007; Whiten,
150 2000; Whiten et al., 1999; Whiten & Vallejo, 2016) whilst the ZLS makes no such
151 assumption.
152 The essence of this debate then can be reduced to the question of whether or not apes
153 copy action forms. Given that the presence of action copying in wild ape cultures is not a
154 necessary conclusion, further experimental studies are required to solve this debate. Several
155 studies have claimed to have identified action copying in apes, but all of these studies incur
156 confounds (Call, 2001; Galef, 2015; Russon & Galdikas, 1993; Tomasello et al., 1993;
157 Whiten et al., 2005). Some conclusions derive from data collected from individuals that have
158 been trained/formally conditioned to copy or approximate it (Call, 2001; Tomasello et al.,
159 1993). Such data may be useful when the task is to consider theoretically developable
160 capacities of apes, however they lack ecological validity and relevance to wild apes, which
161 lack this exposure. Studies that seek to understand the capacity of apes, in their natural state,
162 should avoid a protocol that involves training the subjects; though, it should be recognised
163 that there is a necessary trade-off between methodological rigour (to specify exactly social
164 learning mechanisms) and ecological validity (Kendal et al., 2010). Meanwhile, other claims
165 are based on anecdotal reports (Russon & Galdikas, 1993), which may lack the scientific
166 rigour expected to support such a controversial claim.
167 One of the most common claims for imitation derives from the results of so-called
168 “two-target” (Tennie et al., 2010) or “two-action” (Whiten & Custance, 1996) tests. These
169 tests fail to methodologically discriminate action copying from other variants of social
170 learning (Whiten et al., 2004). Instead of learning the behavioural forms needed to get to a
171 reward/complete a task, these tasks allow observers to augment technical reasoning with
172 environmental results. In this way observers could have copied ‘know-where’ knowledge
173 (i.e., where an object moved to; e.g., Kis et al., 2015), and/or the forms that environmental
174 changes took in the task (object movement re-enactment; Custance et al., 2001). Overall,
175 two-target tests do not necessitate the copying of the demonstrated actions and therefore fail
176 to isolate action form copying. Indeed, even when solutions of two-target tests were
177 demonstrated, in the absence of actions, thus rendering imitation impossible, (so-called
178 ‘ghost’ conditions), apes still show evidence of copying (Hopper et al., 2008).
179 Instead, to elucidate whether apes copy actions, other types of tests are required;
180 specifically, controlled tests that are designed to address whether apes isolate action copying.
181 The necessary tests must be those with tasks that are only ‘solvable’ if actions are clearly
182 copied and other types of information (e.g., ‘know-where’, ‘know-what’, object movements)
183 are experimentally be rendered unsuitable/unavailable. We might refer to these as ‘action-
184 only’ or ‘pure action’ tasks.
185 To date, several ape studies using action-only tasks have been conducted. However, in
186 some of these tests, apes who have been specifically trained in action copying were included
187 (i.e., the Do As I Do paradigm; e.g., Custance et al., 1995; Hayes & Hayes, 1952; Hribar et
188 al., 2014). With the inclusion of such extreme levels of past human interference, the tested
189 apes in these studies reached some statistically detectable level of action copying
190 performance (though the level of novel action copying remained imprecise; Huber et al.,
191 2009). But, as human training is absent in wild apes (Henrich & Tennie, 2017) these types of
192 data must be supplemented by more ecologically-valid tests. But even when untrained apes
193 are tested, it is important that the demonstrated actions are novel (Whiten, 1998), or at least
194 not actions that the observer apes would attempt to use on their own, without demonstrations
195 (Tennie et al., 2012; Tennie, Bandini, et al., 2020). This is necessary to control for potential
196 alternative explanations (such as response facilitation; Byrne, 1994; Tomasello, 1996) and
197 also because the claim of the action-copying hypothesis is that the underlying actions must
198 require copying to come about (compare Whiten et al., 1999).
199 To our knowledge, only three ape action copying experiments (all Pan) have fulfilled
200 these criteria, i.e., have tested untrained apes in action-only tests, using novel action forms for
201 demonstrations (Clay & Tennie, 2017; Tennie et al., 2012; Tomasello et al., 1997). Of the 69
202 tested apes across these three studies, none showed any evidence of novel action copying.
203 This is in stark contrast to human children (3-5 years of age), who, when tested under the
204 same paradigm, copied the demonstrated actions reliably (Clay & Tennie, 2017): 77% of
205 human children copied at least one of the “uncommon” demonstrated actions, compared to
206 0% of bonobos (aged 3-29 years). A lack of evidence in 69 untrained apes to spontaneously
207 copy novel actions suggests that, rather than depending on action copying (as the action
208 copying hypothesis claims), apes must derive the specific forms of their actions individually.
209 A conclusion consistent with the Zone of Latent Solutions hypothesis (which predicts lack of
210 action form copying; Tennie et al., 2009; Tennie, Bandini, et al., 2020; Tennie, Hopper, et al.,
211 2020).
212 All three, ape action-only, studies performed so far used individual demonstrators to
213 perform target action forms. However, where cultural variants are “customary” or even
214 “habitual” in the wild, it is instead a plurality of apes that will perform the relevant actions.
216 Nakamura & Matsuzawa, 1997) or over time (e.g., observer A might see individuals X, Y and
217 Z all cracking nuts over the course of a longer time period – as would likely be the case for
218 “customary” or “habitual” behaviours; Whiten et al., 1999, 2001). In this way, observers are
219 generally outnumbered by potential demonstrators, who will demonstrate specific actions –
220 creating a potential for a majority bias (or even for a conformity bias, see S1 for distinction).
221 It therefore remains possible that wild apes do copy actions, but that past experiments have
222 been unable to detect ape action copying due to not incorporating a majority bias into
223 demonstrations. Thus far, the influence that multiple demonstrators might have on the
224 spontaneous action copying of apes remains unstudied. This lack of data is especially
225 problematic given that majority biases result in marked effects on both human and
226 chimpanzee social learning (e.g., Haun et al., 2014). That is, a majority effect has already
227 been shown for other social learning mechanisms in at least one ape species (Pan troglodytes;
228 Watson, Botting, et al., 2018). These social learning biases are not restricted to apes, or even
229 to primates more generally (e.g., vervet monkeys; Chlorocebus pygerythrus; E. Van de Waal
230 et al., 2013). Rather, a range of species show majority biases, from fruit flies (Drosophila
231 melanogaster; Danchin et al., 2018) to fish (Pungitius pungitius; Pike & Laland, 2010).
232 Perhaps most importantly for current purposes, a majority bias for know-what information
233 has also been found in wild chimpanzee hammer material selection (Luncz & Boesch, 2014).
234 We therefore hypothesised that majority bias might be a necessary, additional, element to
235 elicit the so-far elusive evidence of spontaneous ape action copying.
236 In the current study, we addressed the majority-bias gap in the ape action-only
237 demonstration literature, by conducting a controlled experiment, which included a majority
238 demonstration. In this way we tested the four non-human great ape species for action
239 copying (Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Pongo abelii and Gorilla gorilla gorilla). In order to
240 ensure a valid test of spontaneous ape action copying, we employed a novel action-only task
241 where to ‘pass’ the task, observers were required to copy the form of demonstrated actions.).
242 In particular, demonstrators (four humans), who were in a majority over the ape subjects,
243 showed the subjects (N = 33, of which 19 were mother-reared) two novel actions (which do
244 not appear in ape baselines but do appear in related tests with human children; Clay &
245 Tennie, 2017). These actions were gestures, performed either on top of or in the proximity of
246 a puzzle box, before opening the box to reveal a reward. Subjects were then passed a puzzle
247 box, matched in appearance to the box used by demonstrators. We observed the subjects to
248 ascertain whether they copied or even approximated either of the demonstrated actions.
249 Given our usage of an action-only test method, using novel action forms, any such case
250 would provide strong evidence for the apes’ ability to copy novel actions.
251 Evidence of a single, untrained ape copying novel actions in our study would provide
252 the necessary evidence for the action copying hypothesis of ape cultures, albeit under the
253 conditions of a majority bias. It would also suggest that previous controlled tests for ape
254 action copying (Clay & Tennie, 2017; Tennie et al., 2012; Tomasello et al., 1997) may have
255 failed to detect copying because these earlier tested apes lacked multiple
256 demonstrators/demonstrations. By contrast, human children will already reliably copy actions
257 in action-only tests (and at near ceiling rates) with just a single demonstrator (e.g., Clay et al.,
258 2018; Clay & Tennie, 2017). It is for this reason that we did not include a further human
259 comparison here (it can be assumed that children continue to copy under majority
260 demonstrations conditions). Conversely, failure of all of these untrained apes to copy novel
261 actions – despite majority demonstrations – would be inconsistent with the assertion that ape
262 culture requires action copying (Whiten et al., 1999).
263 Methods
264 Given the controversy of action copying in apes debate (Kendal, 2008; McGrew,
265 2002), we pre-registered our study design to the Open Science Framework (Neadle et al.,
266 2018). Notably, no major methodological deviations from our registered plan were required
267 (minor deviations are described in text). Our pre-registered study was designed to follow a
268 result-dependent design: the methods included a decision tree, such that the particular
269 protocol implemented depended on whether or not evidence of action copying was identified
270 (and when). As no such evidence was found, only the first condition (i.e., “Conformist
271 Transmission” at the top of S2) was implemented. All other conditions as they would have
272 been implemented, following positive results, are described in the registration (Neadle et al.,
273 2018).
274 Design & Stimuli
275 Ape subjects were exposed to human demonstrator(s) performing causally irrelevant
276 actions prior to opening a wooden box (demonstration box). Once the demonstrator opened
277 the demonstration box, the reward inside – a grape – was provided to the subject (Clay &
278 Tennie, 2017). Following the demonstration phase, subjects were provided with their own
279 version of the box (“test box”) which was visually identical to the demonstrator box but in
280 reality, could not be opened (see below). Subjects were then observed and recorded for a
281 maximum of 5 minutes while free to interact with the box. If subjects relinquished contact
282 with the test box for 30 seconds prior to three, four or five minutes of exposure time
283 (depending on the stage of testing, see S3) the trial ended once the next whole minute was
284 reached. In this respect, trial duration was directly influenced by the subject performance –
285 accounting for and accommodating potential differences in motivation across subjects and
286 species. The logic was that, if the subject would attempt, and fail (due to the box being un-
287 openable), to open the box in any way unlike those demonstrated (i.e., lacking the
288 demonstrated actions), they may be more motivated to copy the observed actions, either from
289 remembering demonstrations and/or by paying more attention to demonstrated actions in later
290 trials. This logic therefore implemented the ‘copy if unsuccessful’ (Laland, 2004; see S4) and
291 ‘copy when uncertain’ (Toelch et al., 2013) social learning biases.
293 previous study on action copying with bonobos and human children (Clay & Tennie, 2017).
294 As in this previous study, we used two variants of this box: the “demonstration” box and the
295 “test” box. In order to remain consistent with the previous study (Clay & Tennie, 2017), the
296 demonstration box was made from a piece of wood, cut in half, with a small depression cut
298 the human demonstrators and was never provided to any subjects.
301 box), opened to reveal hidden compartment, right panel contains subject’s box (test box),
302 showing the apparent divide between the two “halves” of the box, note that this box could not
303 be opened as the “divide” was simply a line scored into the still-solid wood.
304 Subjects
305 Subjects (N=33; main sub-sample N=19 of mother-reared apes) were all housed at the
306 Wolfgang Köhler Primate Research Center (WKPRC), Leipzig, Germany. All species at the
307 WKPRC were tested between 11th June and 9th July 2018. Ages were correct at time of testing
308 (S5 for full details): bonobos (n=6; Male=2, Female=4; mother-reared = 3; M =19.83;
age
309 SD =8.28), chimpanzees (n=19; Male=5, Female=14; mother-reared = 9; M =29.42;
age age
310 SD =12.26), western lowland gorillas (n=2; Male=1, Female=1; mother-reared = 2;
age
311 M =16.5; SD =3.54) and Sumatran orangutans (n=6; Male=2, Female=4; mother- reared =
age age
312 6; M =23.16; SD =10.65).
age age
313 Outside of the testing sessions, all subjects were housed in semi-natural indoor and
314 outdoor enclosures containing climbing structures, such as ropes and platforms; and natural
315 features, such as vegetation, trees and streams. They received their regularly scheduled
316 feedings, primarily consisting of vegetables, had access to enrichment devices including
317 shaking boxes and poking bins, and water ad lib. Subjects were never food- or water-deprived
318 for the purposes of this study. All research was conducted in the subjects’ sleeping rooms. If
319 subjects showed signs of distress the trial was terminated, and the subject was released back
320 into the main enclosure immediately – this occurred on one occasion (see S6).
321 Although the apes in this sample have extensive experimental experiences, it is
322 important to note that none of the tested subjects included here were trained to engage with
323 this task or to copy actions. Nevertheless, we also tested one “do-as-I-do”-trained subject – a
324 male chimpanzee aged 17 (Hribar et al., 2014). This subject did not enter our main analysis
325 given that such trained subjects must be excluded in controlled experiments (Henrich &
326 Tennie, 2017). All hand-reared subjects (i.e., human-reared), and those whose rearing
327 histories were unclear (see S5) were considered separately to mother-reared conspecifics and
328 their results are compared to determine the role that rearing history might play in terms of
329 attention paid or engagement with the task.
330 Procedure
331 Demonstrator Training
332 Prior to testing, all human demonstrators were trained (approx. 1 hour) on the
333 demonstration procedure to ensure consistency across demonstrators. In addition, each
334 demonstrator was provided with a video of DN modelling the action demonstration once (S7)
335 via email, which the demonstrator could watch as many times as needed in order to match the
336 actions. Demonstrators were required to copy both the form and speed of the actions using
337 DN’s as a template during demonstrations, which were in turn modelled after the
338 demonstrated actions from Clay and Tennie (2017). ZC instructed and commented on the
339 training videos prior to them being provided to demonstrators.
340 DN and CT observed each demonstrator’s performance prior to the start of testing, to
341 confirm that their demonstrations were proficient; videos of each demonstrator (taken after
342 training) are included in S7. To ensure consistency across time, demonstrator action
343 consistency checks were also performed after each week of testing. Although retraining
344 would have been used, if a reduction in performance occurred, performance remained
345 consistently high quality thus retraining proved unnecessary.
346 All demonstrators (N=2 male; N = 2 females) were human adults between the ages of
347 23 – 30. None of the demonstrators were zoo staff who might otherwise be familiar to the
348 apes (see S8). In order to reduce possible order effects, subjects were randomly allocated to
349 each possible iteration of demonstrator order. The same demonstrators were used throughout,
350 and demonstrators remained in place throughout each trial to maintain the influence
351 throughout the trial, akin to other studies (Haun et al., 2014).
352 Demonstrated Actions
353 This study followed the protocol of a previous, related, study (Clay & Tennie, 2017),
354 in which a (single) demonstrator performed two actions either on or next to the demonstration
355 box (depending on action) during demonstrations. They did so whilst standing in the
356 keeper/researcher side of the so-called “sleeping room” of the subjects. Demonstrations were
357 visible to the subjects through plexiglass and metal mesh. Both actions were preceded by
358 demonstrators extending their arms forwards away from their bodies at a roughly 90° angle,
359 whilst holding the demonstrator box, and performing the actions with their arms extended
360 (see S7).
361 For the first action – “Rub”– the demonstrator rubbed the back of the right hand in a
362 consistent, but slow, circular, clockwise, motion across the top of the demonstrator box – in
363 contact with the box, four times (1 sec per rotation, 4 sec total). For the second action -
364 “Rotate”- the demonstrator raised the right hand and rotated it, at the wrist, in a clockwise
365 motion – not in contact with the demonstrator box, four times (1 sec per rotation, 4 sec total).
366 The demonstrator then opened the demonstrator box, showed the contents of the box (a
367 grape) to the subject and gave the grape to the subject.
369 all demonstrators moved into the testing room the demonstration phase began. In the pre-
370 registered methods , demonstrators were supposed to be present in the testing room prior to
371 the subject entering (Neadle et al., 2018). As it transpired, the human area in the testing
372 rooms was not spacious, and animal keepers preferred to have the group of demonstrators
373 enter after the subject had entered. Thus, subjects entered first, and demonstrators after. This
374 represents the only deviation from our registered methods.
375 Demonstrators performed the actions individually following a predefined order (see
376 S9); with demonstrator order randomly assigned across trials using a random number
378 individual demonstration phase was complete, all four demonstrators also additionally
379 performed a simultaneous group demonstration of both actions.
380 Subject Attention
381 Subjects had the opportunity to observe at least eight full demonstrations: one per
382 demonstrator (performed in sequence), followed by a simultaneous additional demonstration
383 by each of the four demonstrators. Each subject was given up to five demonstrations of the
384 Rub-Rotate action by each demonstrator, and the test box was rebaited after each successful
385 demonstration. If the subject did not see at least one iteration of each action (i.e., Rub or
386 Rotate) during any demonstrator’s demonstration, up to four repeats were given until the
387 subject had either seen both Rub and Rotate or five attempts were given by that demonstrator.
388 As a result, up to 20 demonstrations would have occurred for a subject that never attended to
389 the demonstrations (i.e., four initial demonstrations and 16 repeat demonstrations – four per
390 demonstrator).

395 rebaited again. Chimpanzee image by Jose R. Cabello from Pixabay and is permitted for use

398 Several measures were put in place to ensure that subjects witnessed the
399 demonstrations and that the demonstrators could confirm that the subject had seen the
400 demonstration. Once the subject indicated a ‘readiness to start the trial’ (defined as head
401 oriented towards the demonstrator, who was holding the box, for one second or more), the
402 demonstration began. Subjects were required to watch each action (i.e., one iteration of Rub
403 and one of Rotate), as performed by each demonstrator, at least once (we define this as
404 ‘attending’). In order to facilitate this, all demonstrators were permitted to call the subject’s
405 name to gain their attention as often as required prior to and throughout the demonstration.
406 This definition of attentiveness is in line with the concept of “peering” (Schuppli et al., 2016),
407 adopted in wild orangutans. Each iteration of the action (4x Rubs or 4x Rotations) lasted for
408 approx. 4 seconds, coupled with the 1 second ‘readiness’ period resulting in the 5 seconds
409 required for peering. Our subjects were also always within the 2-5m radius required for
410 peering, owing to the size of the testing rooms (approx. 2.5 x 2.5m – including human and
411 animal areas).
412 After observing the subject during each demonstration, all demonstrators verbally
413 reported (yes/no for each action, in demonstrator order) whether the subject observed none,
414 part of, or the whole of each demonstration. If two or more of the demonstrators replied with
415 a “no” to either of the actions (i.e., it had not been observed), the previous demonstrator
416 repeated their demonstration (up to a maximum of five demonstrations; see above). The next
417 demonstrator followed the same procedure, and so on, until the subject had observed the full
418 demonstration of both actions at least four times (across all demonstrators). The number of
419 repeat trials required to attain agreement was recorded after the study was completed, by
420 reviewing the video footage and used as a proxy for subject attentiveness, such that higher
421 numbers of repeat trials equate to less attentiveness to the demonstrations. This meant that a
422 maximum of 21 (20 single demonstrator & one group) demonstrations were possible, with a
423 maximum of 16 repeated demonstrations (four repeats per demonstrator).
424 Task Period
425 Each subject was then exposed to the task. The final demonstrator took the
426 demonstration box behind the occlusion screen and swapped it for the test box. The subject
427 was given the test box by the demonstrator, via a secure hatch. The subject then had a
428 maximum of five minutes to copy the actions demonstrated (see above and S3). All trials
429 were recorded using two camcorders (Panasonic HC-V777) mounted on tripods at either end
430 of the line of demonstrators, in addition to the demonstrator-mounted GoPro (Hero Session 5)
431 cameras. Subjects were exposed to three trials each.
432 Ethics
433 The study was ethically approved by an internal committee of the Max Planck
434 Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (director, research coordinator), the Leipzig zoo
435 (head keeper, curator, vet) and the University of Birmingham AWERB committee (reference
436 no. UOB 31213). No medical, toxicological or neurobiological research of any kind is
437 conducted at the WKPRC. Research was non-invasive and strictly adhered to the legal
438 requirements of Germany. Animal husbandry and research comply with the “EAZA
439 Minimum Standards for the Accommodation and Care of Animals in Zoos and Aquaria”, the
440 “WAZA Ethical Guidelines for the Conduct of Research on Animals by Zoos and Aquariums”
441 and the “Guidelines for the Treatment of Animals in Behavioral Research and Teaching” of
442 the Association for the Study of Animal Behavior (ASAB). IAUCUC was not necessary to
443 conduct this research.
444 Participation was voluntary: internal doors were opened, and the subjects could enter
445 voluntarily. Those that entered were released as soon as they showed any potential signs of
446 stress – this occurred twice in the gorilla sample (see S5). Three trials were attempted with
447 each subject, though due to the voluntary nature of this study, sometimes fewer trials were
448 attained (see S5). Five subjects from the WKPRC chose not to participate in all trials (two
449 orangutans, two gorillas and one bonobo; see S5).
450 Subjects were tested individually in most cases as this was something they were
451 already accustomed to, excluding cases of mothers and dependent offspring and any
452 individuals that were uncomfortable being separated. Such cases were noted (n =2;
bonobo
453 n =2; n =1; n = 2; though, the ‘other’ individual present was a dependent
chimpanzee gorilla orangutan
454 juvenile/infant in all cases except the chimpanzee cases see S5). Individual testing ensured
455 an effective demonstrator majority to maximize the effect of majority. An effective majority
456 in human tests has been shown to be 3:1 (Bond & Smith, 1996; Haun et al., 2013), but here
457 we used a 4:1 ratio to also harvest potential effects of demonstrator sex majority (by always
458 using two male and two female demonstrators). When subjects were tested in dyads an
459 overall ratio of 4:2 was the maximum that could be achieved (still, this represented a
460 majority).
461 Behavioural Coding & Analysis
462 Behaviours were live coded and after each trial each demonstrator independently
463 wrote down whether they considered any of the subject’s actions during a trial to constitute
464 action copying. The paper on which the live coders independently wrote their decision was
465 then folded in half and placed into a container for later counting. A positive case of copying
466 would have been recorded if more than half (i.e., 3 or 4) of the demonstrators had ever
467 considered that the subject had copied at least one of the demonstrated actions.
468 Demonstrators were additionally instructed that any approximation of action copying (see
470 a subject copying the Rub action with the left hand and for a half rotation and without
471 attempting a Rotate action would be considered as having copied the Rub action for the
472 purpose of the result dependent design. These approximations would have been further
475 first trial, after demonstrators had received training on the actions from DN. These
476 instructions were later reiterated, immediately prior to first testing session.
Behaviour Description
Rub The subject places the back of their hand (either hand), on top of
(or close above) the box and rubs it in a circular motion
(regardless of direction).
Rotate The subject raises their hand (either hand) and rotates it – for a
minimum of 180˚ at the wrist (regardless of direction).
Rub-Rotate The subject performs the “Rub” behaviour, and this is followed
by the “Rotate” behaviour
Rotate-Rub The subject performs the “Rotate” behaviour, and this is followed
by the “Rub” behaviour
No relevant behaviour The subject performs none of the actions described here
478 Using video analysis, we calculated the mean time an individual spent interacting
479 with the test box, which we used as a proxy for motivation to engage. As each subject had
480 either a three, four or five-minute trial (see S3), the total number of seconds that the subject
481 was in contact with the test box was divided by the total trial time (in seconds), resulting in a
482 percentage of “motivation”.
483 All analyses and data-based figures were produced in R (version 3.4.3(R Core Team,
484 2020)) and R-Studio (version 1.1.423 (RStudio Team, 2016)). The following packages were
485 utilised for analysis/visualisation: ggplot2 (version 3.1.0), ggpubr (version 0.2.0), psych
486 (version 1.8.10), car (version 3.0-2), cowplot (version 0.9.3), multicomp (version 1.4-8),
487 ggsignif (version 0.4.0), pastecs (version 1.3.21) Additional, planned, analyses (Neadle et al.,
488 2018) were not performed given the null findings.
489 Interrater reliability
490 Interrater reliability for attentiveness to the demonstration was assessed during trials.
491 In the case that even a single potential instance of action copying was identified during live
492 coding, a naïve second coder would have been required for post hoc coding. However, as no
493 cases of action copying were observed, a second coder was not required. There were always
494 four independent witnesses to any given event. As a result, a four-way instantaneous
495 interrater reliability was possible. As there were no cases in which any of the demonstrators
496 suggested that either action had been approximated at by any of the tested apes, there was no
497 need for further interrater reliability checks.
498 Results
499 We found no evidence of action copying, not even in approximation, in any trial by any
500 subject (mother-reared (N=19), hand-reared (n=10) or those whose rearing history was unclear
501 or unknown (n=3)). Neither was there any evidence of action copying or approximations of it
502 in an additional chimpanzee who was previously trained the Do-As-I-Do paradigm (see S10).
503 Findings, from all subjects, were confirmed using a four-way live coding system (see above).
504 Coding demonstrated subjects reliably attended to the demonstrations and were motivated to
505 interact with the test apparatus – though with inter-species variations.
506 As our entire matrix consisted of zero values, inferential statistics were limited.
507 However, using a one-way Chi-Square Goodness of Fit, we determined the expected
508 probability of copying that would harmonise our observations with expected results. We
509 adopted an iterative approach, where expected frequencies of action copying (expressed as a
510 percentage of ‘successful’ trials) were compared to the observed frequencies; this expected
511 frequency was reduced until our (fully negative) data set were consistent with the theoretically
513 square test is that the count of expected observations should not be less than 5 (Field, 2013),
514 thus then the count falls below this the results should be treated with caution.
516 (77%) was chosen as Clay and Tennie (2017) identified this value in children, using this task.
517 The results show that our figures are inconsistent with an expected copying probability of
518 greater than 10%. Whilst it is theoretically possible to attempt to determine the exact point
519 where values fall below the accepted threshold of p=.05, the assumptions of Chi-Square do not
520 allow for these figures to be interpreted meaningfully, therefore a range of values must be
521 accepted. This implies that, in order to account for our results, the copying hypothesis would
522 need to be caveated, specifying an expected copying probability of between 5% and 10%.
523 Larger samples and, with these, larger expected frequencies, are required to establish where in
524 this range the true value lies. These expected frequencies are generated using the, smaller,
525 mother-reared only subset and therefore represent a more conservative estimate of the expected
526 probability (due to smaller expected frequencies greater specificity is not possible). See S10
527 for these analyses repeated with the full sample, including hand-reared/unknown subjects.

532 Each species also contained an individual/s that required no repeat demonstrations for
533 at least one of their trials (N = 2, N = 4, N = 1, N = 3). There are clear

535 never an instance of copying these differences clearly did not influence the outcome

537 IQR =3.75; Mdn =1.50, IQR =4.25). These differences are characterised by a

538 substantial degree of inter-species variance, indicating an element of intra-species idiosyncrasy.
539 There are no clear differences in number of repeat demonstrations as a function of either sex

549 to interact with the test box after demonstrations (defined as >50% interaction time during
550 trial); though, no gorillas interacted to this extent. Across all species, subjects spent an average

555 then these inter-species differences would have been more relevant – as it was there was never
556 an instance of copying identified and these figures should simply be taken as descriptive.
557 Again, these differences are typified by very large intra-species variance, in all but the gorilla
558 sample which consistently showed very little interaction with the box. There were again no
559 clear differences in the percentage of interaction time as a function of sex or rearing history
564 (B) or rearing history (D). Central horizontal bar represents median value, upper and lower
565 hinges correspond to 75th and 25th percentiles, upper and lower whiskers extend to largest or

567 Discussion
568 Examining the responses of a total of 33 captive great ape subjects, across four
569 species and with a variety of rearing backgrounds, revealed no evidence (or approximations)
570 of spontaneous action copying – despite majority demonstrations. None of these 33 untrained
571 subjects (19 mother-reared; 14 hand-reared or unknown history), copied a single
572 demonstrated action. Although there were species differences in attention and engagement
573 with the task, this variability did not translate to species differences in copying behaviour.
574 This study included methodological elements that aimed to measure and ensure that
575 subjects were attending to the demonstrations, thus ensuring that our sample had a ‘fair
576 chance’ of copying. Firstly, demonstrations did not commence until the subject had oriented
577 their head towards the demonstrator (for at least one second). Secondly, once each
578 demonstration was completed, a four-way reliability system was used, the results of this
579 showed that there was never an instance where all the possible repeat demonstrations had to
580 be provided. In this way, we created measures akin to so-called “peering” in wild apes, which
581 likewise measures close observation behaviour (within 2-5 meters – depending on the
582 behaviour, in wild orangutans Schuppli et al., 2016). In our study, given the proximity of
583 demonstrators to subjects (less than 2.5m apart at all times) and the timings required by the
584 readiness to start period and an observation of a full demonstration cycle (at least 5 seconds)
585 our measures have concurrent validity with relates research (5+ seconds watching and within
586 2m+ or 5m+, depending on context; 77). We observed some inter-species variation in
587 attentiveness to demonstrators, but subjects of all species proved generally motivated to
588 attend to demonstrations – as, again, none of our subjects ever required the maximum
589 possible number of demonstrations. Thus, lack of observation, or lack motivation to observe,
590 cannot explain our negative findings.
591 Our sample (Penndorf & Aplin, 2020), method (Drea & Wallen, 1999) and treatment
592 (Haun et al., 2012) were all selected to promote action copying in our subjects. Regarding
593 captivity, it has been shown that captive animals are generally more successful in both asocial
594 and social learning tasks as compared to wild conspecifics (Penndorf & Aplin, 2020).
595 Therefore, our captive sample should be considered as more likely to copy actions than wild
596 conspecifics, yet even then, they did not copy actions. Regarding individual testing, it has
597 been suggested that individual testing neutralises the potential confounding effect of rank
598 differences in primate social learning (Drea & Wallen, 1999). Therefore, by testing our
599 subjects individually, we essentially controlled for social rank during the demonstrations,
600 rendering all of our subjects equally likely to copy, regardless of rank. Regarding majority
601 bias, it has been suggested that chimpanzees, but perhaps not orangutans, are subject to
602 majority influence (Haun et al., 2012) and it has been claimed that this can influence learning
603 (through unspecified social learning mechanisms; Watson, Lambeth, et al., 2018). These
604 biases have been noted to be present not only in apes, but in primates more generally and in
605 various other animal species (Watson, Botting, et al., 2018). Here, we employed such a
606 majority ratio of demonstrators to observers (Luncz & Boesch, 2014). Given that previous
607 attempts at identifying ‘pure’ action copying in apes have only utilised single demonstrator
608 conditions, our study therefore attempted, for the first time, to utilise majority biases to
609 increase the likelihood of action copying to the point of them occurring, however, even under
610 this majority bias no ape action copying occurred.
611 Furthermore, the entire underlying paradigm of overimitation/copy-when-
612 unsuccessful (Clay & Tennie, 2017; Laland, 2004), which we applied here, was designed to
613 improve the chances of identifying ape action copying. Specifically, regarding overimitation,
614 the actions that were performed were likely novel to subjects (as the keepers confirmed to
615 us). These novel actions had been selected to be causally irrelevant (required in testing for
616 overimitation; Lyons et al., 2007) and they are known to lead to action copying in another
617 species - humans (Clay et al., 2018; Clay & Tennie, 2017). Regarding our use of the copy-
618 when-unsuccessful learning bias (Laland, 2004), we provided subjects with a test box that
619 could not be opened, thereby reliably creating a situation for each subject in which it should
620 seem (especially across trials) as if the demonstrated actions were necessary before the box
621 would open. This was designed to create a situation in which the failure to open the box
622 should have resulted in higher motivation to copy the demonstrated actions (also and
623 especially across trials). This was done to tap into a potentially existent ape ‘copy-when-
624 unsuccessful-bias’ (Laland, 2004), especially in the event that apes failed to copy
625 immediately in the first trial before even attempting to open the box. Note that our results
626 were not dependent on the presence of a copy-when-unsuccessful-bias in apes (which may be
627 absent) – we merely implemented this manipulation (i.e., an impossible box) as an additional
628 motivation and as an additional chance of apes to copy actions. In summary, we thoroughly
629 designed our study to maximise the chances of identifying action copying in apes. Our data
630 are therefore the outcome of a ‘best-case scenario’ that we designed. Yet, even in this best-
631 case scenario, not a single ape copied actions.
632 To date, all attempts at ‘action-only’ ape social learning studies in captivity have
633 failed to detect action copying (Clay & Tennie, 2017; Tennie et al., 2012; Tomasello et al.,
634 1997; and this study). Extrapolating these findings to wild apes, these results do not support
635 the claim that ape culture could rely on action copying (see claims by Gruber et al., 2015;
636 Horner & Whiten, 2005; Whiten et al., 1999, 2009; Whiten & Custance, 1996). That is, the
637 absence of action copying in apes in tests clearly does not support the ‘ape action copying
638 hypothesis’. Instead, these results are consistent with the notion that wild ape behaviour –
639 while often cultural in a minimal sense, i.e., in the relative frequency of behavioural forms
640 (Neadle et al., 2017) – does instead have to rely on individual learning to develop these
641 behavioural forms. The know-how (Bandini et al., 2020) of producing these behavioural
642 forms is therefore unlikely to be contingent on action copying. This is not to say that no other
643 variants of social learning play a role in regulating the frequency of wild ape behavioural
644 forms. On the contrary, many studies have now shown that captive apes are able to socially
645 learn non-action aspects from humans and conspecifics (Tennie, Bandini, et al., 2020; Tennie,
646 Hopper, et al., 2020). In this way, apes have been shown, for example, to learn socially what
647 they should engage with (know-what), and also where (know-where) - i.e., to engage in social
648 learning mechanisms that do not require action copying skills. The repeated and continuing
649 application of these non-copying social learning processes clearly has population-wide
650 consequences. It results in socially mediated serial reinnovations of the resulting behavioural
651 forms, or action patterns, in affected individuals (Bandini & Tennie, 2017; Tennie et al., 2009;
652 Tennie, Bandini, et al., 2020; Tennie, Hopper, et al., 2020). Over time, this creates (and
653 maintains) the ape cultures that have been described, i.e., specific mixes of behavioural forms
654 at the population level that often differ between populations (Acerbi et al., 2012). In contrast,
655 humans appear to be unique among great apes in their propensity to spontaneously copy the
656 behavioural form itself – including novel and abstract actions – supporting the long-held
657 claim that this skill is a fundamental component of human cumulative culture (Tomasello,
658 1999). This is true especially of human culture that is purely action-based (such as rituals and
659 dances; Tennie et al., 2012).
660 The demonstrated actions we used in our current study were novel to subjects by our
661 choice, they were therefore not within the existing repertoire of the subjects (Clay & Tennie,
662 2017). The copying of such novel actions is well demonstrated in studies of human action
663 copying (Clay et al., 2018; Clay & Tennie, 2017). Although the use of novel actions may
664 makes the task more ‘difficult’ for apes (Byrne, 2009), this is by design. Novel actions must
665 be used as target actions in such studies, to ensure that action matching is not merely a carry-
666 over product of prior social or individual learning where mere triggering can release a similar
667 behaviour in others (Tennie, Bandini, et al., 2020; Tennie & Hedwig, 2009). The use of novel
668 actions thus ensures a valid test of whether the animals require that the action is indeed
669 copied for it to occur (culture-dependency; Reindl et al., 2017). Given that absence of novel
670 action copying in our best-case-scenario, majority demonstration study, in conjunction with
671 all earlier failures of apes to spontaneously copy novel actions (Clay & Tennie, 2017; Tennie
672 et al., 2012; Tomasello et al., 1997), there exists a reliably empirical distinction between ape
673 and human action copying capacity/propensity. This difference matches the proposed
674 distinction between human and non-human ape cultures, i.e., between the kinds of cultures
675 that different social learning mechanisms can produce (Boyd & Richerson, 1996; Tennie et
676 al., 2009; Tennie, Bandini, et al., 2020; Tomasello, 1998).
677 Our findings and conclusions might be surprising to some readers. This is likely
678 because the now-vast animal social learning literature includes several claims for animals
679 copying actions. These claims exist in a range of species, from lizards (Kis et al., 2015) to
680 monkeys (Voelkl & Huber, 2000) to chimpanzees (Whiten et al., 2009). However, these
681 results do not stand in contrast to our findings. This is because these claims, when they are
682 about non-human great apes, invariably used methodologies that are logically unable to
683 pinpoint novel action copying. Most typically, these claims derived from applications of so-
684 called two-target tasks. A typical two-target task might require a bolt (or lever, or door) to
685 either be pressed or be pushed (Bugnyar & Huber, 1997). But these tasks are confounded, as
686 they are proven theoretically and empirically to be solvable in the absence of action copying
687 (Heyes et al., 1994; Tennie et al., 2006) – for example, chimpanzees solve these tasks even
688 when no actions were ever demonstrated (Hopper et al., 2008). Sometimes, more
689 manipulations are used than just two-target defences. For example, in a widely cited study by
690 Horner and Whiten (2005), chimpanzees were said to have been required to copy ‘causally
691 irrelevant actions’ in solving such a puzzle box. Specifically, this study used a puzzle box
692 designs in which a whole line of “defences” existed, such as moving doors, bolt-removal and
693 stick insertion affordances. The authors concluded with evidence of chimpanzee action
694 copying, based on a match of some observers in their approach to what they were
695 demonstrated. However, this conclusion does not follow, as all of the defences merely
696 required the application of action patterns that were within individual reach of the tested
697 chimpanzees (Tennie, Hopper, et al., 2020). The defences on the puzzle box resembled those
698 commonly used in ape enrichment and also in other studies (e.g., Whiten et al., 2003) that
699 simulated extractive foraging techniques (hence have been called “artificial fruits”; e.g.,
700 Whiten et al., 1996). A recent review (Tennie, Hopper, et al., 2020) showed that in all these
701 cases, and across all two-target studies and derivatives, there is empirical evidence that all
702 these defences could be overcome by ape subjects on their own - regardless of
703 demonstrations. Thus, it does not matter whether a bolt had to be moved to the left or to the
704 right, as both directional movements are perfectly producible by naïve apes in the entire
705 absence of demonstrations. Overall, then, none of these earlier action copying claims in apes
706 – including the one by Horner and Whiten (2005), tested for novel action copying (or even
707 action copying more generally). The positive findings in these studies remain in stark, and
708 telling, contrast to the negative findings in ape studies that instead tested for novel action
709 copying.
710 While apes did not copy actions in two-target tasks, it is not the case that they ignored
711 other aspects of demonstrations. While apes could solve these tasks on their own – as they
712 had no need to learn anything novel and copying-dependent – they nevertheless often showed
713 a proclivity to match aspects of demonstrations, such as where a bolt moves to, where to
714 insert a stick, or what object(s) to interact with. Future studies that aim to detect ape action
715 copying must therefore continue to control for these and other confounding types of
716 knowledge (e.g., ‘know-where’, ‘know-what’; Bandini et al., 2020) before claims can be
717 made regarding the transmission of actions (behavioural know-how). Furthermore, again,
718 even after these confounds are controlled for, when it comes to action copying, the
719 demonstrated actions must be novel and copying-dependent. These actions should not,
720 therefore, appear in baselines. They should not be anything that apes do in the absence of
721 demonstrations – at least when the goal of the study is to determine whether apes, like
722 humans, are able to copy something that they could not do on their own.
723 If the ape action copying hypothesis is to be upheld, then apes should prove able to
724 copy novel actions, as this would then necessarily be the mechanism by which naïve
725 individuals, of a new generation, must learn the actions of the existing generation (Boyd &
726 Richerson, 1996; Tomasello, 1998, 1999). But then the apes in our study should have copied
727 the demonstrated actions – yet this copying never occurred. That is, the prediction of the ape
728 action copying hypothesis, that apes should prove able to copy novel actions, has once again
729 failed to be identified, which remains consistent with previous tests (Clay & Tennie, 2017;
730 Tennie et al., 2012; Tomasello et al., 1997). In stark contrast to the case of apes (Tennie et al.,
731 2012; Tomasello et al., 1997; this study), human children have been shown to copy at least
732 one of these demonstrated novel actions – even at near ceiling levels – and even when a
733 majority demonstration was lacking (in 77% of trials; Clay & Tennie, 2017). Therefore,
734 regardless of whether this ape/human difference in novel action copying is perceived to be
735 one of absolute ability (Tennie et al., 2009; Tennie, Bandini, et al., 2020) or one of degree, it
736 is clear that an important species difference exists in novel action copying. This difference is
737 so large that, based on all evidence to date, we must conclude that action copying cannot
738 feasibly be the cornerstone of ape culture that it has been claimed to be (e.g., Whiten et al.,
739 1999).
740 Our results suggest that the hypothesis that action copying is often the basis of ape
741 culture (e.g., Whiten et al., 1999) should be rejected. Even considering the notion that action
742 copying might merely be rare in wild apes, their number could only be very few. Given all
743 the data available, support for this hypothesis must depend now on the presentation of
744 positive evidence - namely that these behaviours must not occur in baselines, or through non-
745 copying social learning variants (Bandini et al., 2020), and that their occurrence fully depends
746 on access to action demonstrations.
747 The conclusion that ape cultures cannot feasibly be reliant on action copying is
748 consistent with accumulating findings that wild ape behaviours indeed do not require action
749 copying to be expressed. The action forms of various wild behaviours have been shown to
750 reappear spontaneously in naïve, untrained, mother-reared apes without any need to observe
751 these actions (Tennie et al., 2009; Tennie, Hopper, et al., 2020). Such copying-independent
752 action forms have been shown to include gestures (Byrne et al., 2017) and foraging
753 techniques, including tool-use (Bandini & Tennie, 2017; Motes-Rodrigo et al., 2019; Neadle
754 et al., 2017; Tennie et al., 2008). Given that various ape ‘cultural’ behaviours can be
755 explained through individual learning alone, and the likelihood that ape action copying is rare
756 to absent, it seems highly unlikely that wild ape cultures are reliant on copying or that they
757 could be reliant on such learning. Instead, the highest likelihood is that ape culture can be
758 explained by the effects of “socially mediated serial reinnovations” (Bandini & Tennie,
759 2017). That is, wild ape culture is explicable through an interplay between social and asocial
760 learning (Galef, 2015) in the absence of form copying (Tennie, Bandini, et al., 2020; Tennie,
761 Hopper, et al., 2020). Specifically, whilst the frequency of the (re)innovation of affected
762 behaviours appears to be regulated by non-copying social learning variants (e.g., local or
763 stimulus enhancement; or know-where and know-what etc.), the behavioural form is more
764 parsimoniously be explained through individual reinnovation (Tennie et al., 2009; Tennie,
765 Hopper, et al., 2020). Again, the very fact that form-naive apes proved perfectly capable of
766 producing these forms supports this theory.
767 It might seem a potential limitation of our study that human demonstrators were used,
768 as opposed to conspecifics (Whiten, 2017). But whilst the use of human demonstrators for
769 apes is considered as less effective than conspecifics (Hopper et al., 2015), the overwhelming
770 pattern in previous social learning studies is that apes attend well to human demonstrators
771 (Horner & Whiten, 2005; e.g., Whiten, 1998); the apes in our study were no exception (see
772 our peering/attention data). Indeed, two earlier ape tests of pure novel action copying in
773 which conspecific demonstrators were used also showed similar negative results (Tennie et
774 al., 2012; Tomasello et al., 1997). Even so, future studies might consider replicating our
775 methodology using trained conspecifics as demonstrators; and these studies should then
776 contain multiple demonstrators, as we did here (in a majority influence paradigm; sensu
777 Asch, 1956).
778 It might further be objected that perhaps apes may only copy their mothers, within a
779 ‘master-apprentice’ model (Matsuzawa et al., 2008). At first, this hypothesis would seem to
780 explain the negative results of all ape ‘pure’ action copying studies thus far. However, in the
781 earliest of the ‘pure’ action copying studies (Tomasello et al., 1997) the two demonstrators
782 were mothers, and indeed performed their action demonstrations in the presence of their
783 offspring. One daughter often failed to attend to her mother’s demonstrations. The juvenile
784 daughter of the other subject observed her mother’s demonstrations 99 times (indeed, the
785 most observations of all test subjects) and yet she failed to copy her mother’s novel actions.
786 Empirically, therefore, even the notion that it requires mother demonstrations for apes to copy
787 actions fails. But there are strong additional reasons to doubt any such “Uniparental cultural
788 transmission” hypotheses – as these could not give rise to and neither could they maintain the
789 ape cultures we see in the wild (Enquist et al., 2010). Other mechanisms must be at work (and
790 given all data, this can only be socially mediated reinnovation, see above). This is the
791 unequivocal outcome of cultural transmission modelling of uniparental cultural transmission
792 (Enquist et al., 2010). Enquist et al.’s model showed that having a single cultural “parent”
793 cannot maintain cultural patterns of form transmission over time. Transmission would break
794 down eventually and could not recover. One could say that “it takes a village to keep culture
795 afloat”. And so, even the claim that apes copy actions only from their mothers does not stand
796 – neither empirically, nor theoretically.
797 Another potential objection relates to the notion of a potential ‘sensitive learning
798 period’ in ape action copying (3-5 years old in chimpanzees; Biro et al., 2003). The
799 chimpanzees in our sample were aged 14-52 years old, thus, placing them outside most
800 claimed sensitive learning periods (e.g., Biro et al., 2003). However, some chimpanzees in
801 other ‘pure’ action studies were inside the claimed sensitive range, and still they did not copy
802 actions (Tennie et al., 2012: minimum age = 5yo; Tomasello et al., 1997: minimum age =
803 2yo). In addition, in the previous bonobo study of ‘pure’ action copying (Clay & Tennie,
804 2017) bonobos across the age range (i.e., including juveniles; 3-29 years old) also failed to
805 copy novel actions. Note that it has also been suggested that, at least in some ape species, a
806 particularly young sample (within the sensitive learning period) might not be optimal for
807 detecting action copying, as copying tendency may instead increase as a function of age
808 (Custance et al., 2001). Thus, our overall older sample should not be a significantly limiting
809 factor in our subjects’ clear lack of action copying even following majority demonstrations.
810 Given that the apes we tested were mostly born and raised in captivity, it may be
811 claimed that our subjects are somewhat, or at least relatively more, human-enculturated than
812 wild populations, perhaps also given the relatively high frequency of cognitive testing at the
813 WKPRC (e.g., Allritz et al., 2013; Buttelmann et al., 2013; van Leeuwen & Call, 2017;
814 Wobber et al., 2014). However, this is not a problem for our conclusion, as any increase in
815 human enculturation – including merely a relative increase over wild conspecifics – should
816 be expected to increase the likelihood of action copying (Tomasello et al., 1993). This effect
817 is not even limited to primates (Gajdon et al., 2004; Penndorf & Aplin, 2020). We therefore
818 see our selection of sample population as unproblematic to critically examine the predictions
819 of the ape action copying hypothesis – as, if our data were biased, it would have been instead
820 biased in support of the action copying hypothesis. Instead, our conditions and sample
821 represent a ‘best case’, conservative, approach as it was arguably designed to be the most
822 likely to result in ape novel action copying occurring, compared to other samples, test
823 situations, and arguably even when compared to wild populations. Therefore, the fact that
824 even this “best case” scenario failed to copy novel actions – even when these were
825 demonstrated by a majority – suggests evidence incompatible with the ape action copying
826 hypothesis.
827 This lack of - or greatly reduced likelihood of - novel action copying in apes, or
828 know-how copying (Bandini et al., 2020) might be a definitive feature that distinguishes
829 human culture from the remainder of the great ape clade (Tomasello, 1999). The human
830 tendency to copy novel – even causally opaque actions – might be the factor that has allowed
831 our species to transcend ape-type cultures to produce and maintain our own, cumulative
832 culture of know-how (Boyd & Richerson, 1996; Galef, 1992; Gergely & Csibra, 2005; Tennie
833 et al., 2009; Tomasello, 1999). This highlights the importance of understanding the role (if
834 any) that know-how copying plays in the cultures of our closest living relatives (and in early
835 hominins; Tennie et al., 2017). In spite of this, studies of ‘pure’ action copying in apes have
836 only started to be performed rather recently. Wherever these studies have been attempted (this
837 being one), the marked absence of action copying, combined with data gleaned from other
838 experimental (e.g., Bandini & Tennie, 2017) and modelling studies (Enquist et al., 2010),
839 speaks against the possibility that ape culture is often – or perhaps ever – underlain by action
840 copying. In clarifying any potential differences between our own species and our closest
841 extant relatives it becomes possible to help approximate the point in our evolutionary past
842 when our remarkable capacity for culture evolved. Our results suggest that in contrast to
843 previous assertions, novel action copying may have evolved within our own hominin lineage,
844 i.e., after the split from other great ape lineages (Tennie et al., 2017). If true, this would mean
845 that the ape action copying hypothesis is false.
846 In sum, ape behaviours can and do re-occur in the absence of action copying (Bandini
847 & Tennie, 2019; Motes-Rodrigo et al., 2019) and apes reliably fail to copy novel actions
848 under controlled conditions(Clay & Tennie, 2017; Tennie et al., 2012; Tomasello et al.,
849 1997)– even when majority demonstrations are used (this study). The most parsimonious
850 explanation for these and other patterns is that action copying plays a minimal or no role in
851 wild ape cultures.
