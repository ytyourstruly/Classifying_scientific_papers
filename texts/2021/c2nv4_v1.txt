PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT AND (MAL)ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING 2
Abstract
Emerging adulthood can be experienced as a stressful period because of instability and
unsettlement. Some emerging adults may experience burnout symptoms if the stressors
accumulate or become chronic over time, others may thrive and develop into more happy
individuals. Personality might be an important factor explaining this heterogeneity in
functioning. Although personality is relatively stable over time, there are important individual
differences in personality development. Given the importance of personality for
(mal)adaptive functioning, an important question is whether individual differences in
personality development from adolescence to emerging adulthood are associated with
burnout and happiness in emerging adulthood. At Time 1 (2009; M age = 15.7 years), Time 2
(2012), and Time 3 (2015), participants (N = 329; 43.1% boys) reported on their Big Five
personality dimensions: extraversion, agreeableness/benevolence, conscientiousness,
emotional stability, and openness/imagination. Burnout symptoms (exhaustion,
disengagement) and happiness (life satisfaction, overall affect) were measured through self-
reports at Time 4 (2018). Initial levels of all personality dimensions (except benevolence)
were negatively related to fewer burnout symptoms. Initial levels of all personality
dimensions were related to more happiness. Stronger increases in extraversion, emotional
stability, and imagination, were related to fewer burnout symptoms and more happiness in
emerging adulthood. Results indicate the importance of studying personality development as
determinants of later functioning, above and beyond effects of initial levels of personality.
Findings offer new insights in the field of personality, occupational, and positive psychology
for the longitudinal study of personality as antecedent of (mal)adaptive functioning, and
provide important clues for future research.

PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT AND (MAL)ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING 3
Introduction
There is a growing scientific and societal interest in how individuals function in emerging
adulthood as they develop in a transition period (age 18 to 25 years) characterized by
opportunities, identity exploration, feeling in-between, and instability in all life domains
(Arnett et al., 2014). Accordingly, emerging adulthood may be experienced as a stressful
developmental period in life (Arnett, 2000; Arnett et al., 2014; Foster et al., 2008). These
experiences may develop into burnout symptoms if the stressors emerging adults are
confronted with accumulate over time and become chronic. However, emerging adulthood
may also be experienced as a period of challenges during which individuals may thrive and
develop into happy individuals showing adaptive behavior (Switek & Easterlin, 2018).
Indeed, emerging adults show considerable heterogeneity in their levels of functioning
(Arnett, 2000; 2007; Scales et al., 2016). Personality is suggested to be an important factor
explaining this heterogeneity in functioning, as certain personality traits may predispose
individuals to interpret situations as more negative, resulting in maladaptive functioning
(Bakker & De Vries, 2021; Swider & Zimmerman, 2010, Van Eldik et al. 2020), or more
positive, resulting in adaptive functioning (Garcia, 2011; Ozer & Benet-Martinez, 2006).
Most studies on the long-term relation between personality and functioning assessed
personality at only one time point in life (e.g., Shiner & Masten, 2012), thereby implicitly
assuming that personality is static. Studies on personality change have indeed shown that
personality traits are relatively stable over time, but there are important individual differences
in personality change during adulthood (Anusic & Schimmack, 2016; Caspi et al., 2005;
McCrae & Costa, 1999; Roberts et al., 2006) and even more so during childhood and
adolescence (De Haan et al., 2017; Van den Akker et al., 2014). As theory and empirical
literature suggest that personality changes (from adolescence on) and personality
(development) are significantly linked to (mal)adaptive functioning, we examined how
PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT AND (MAL)ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING 4
individual differences in personality development from adolescence to emerging adulthood
are related to burnout and happiness in emerging adulthood.
The current study addresses several knowledge gaps. Firstly, this study provides
unique knowledge on how individual differences in initial levels and development of
personality relate to burnout symptoms and happiness in emerging adulthood. Second, our
study focuses on the understudied role of individual characteristics, and more specifically
personality, as predictor of burnout symptoms. Third, our focus on happiness, next to
burnout, in emerging adults rests on the positive psychological perspective that absence of
problems does not indicate healthy functioning (Westerhof & Keyes, 2010; World Health
Organization, 2006). Thus, adding an adaptive measure as a counterweight to a maladaptive
view is needed to add valuable knowledge to our understanding of an individual’s wellbeing
(Arslan et al., 2021).
Individual Differences in Personality Development and (Mal)Adaptive Functioning
The Big Five approach of personality constitutes one of the best established and most
often used model applicable to humans of all ages (Caspi & Shiner, 2006; Costa & McCrae,
1992). Five distinct personality domains are identified: Extraversion (being sociable,
talkative), Agreeableness (Benevolence with regard to child personality; Mervielde & De
Fruyt, 1999) (being cooperative, good-natured, helpful), Conscientiousness (responsible,
orderly, organized), Emotional Stability (versus Neuroticism; level of emotional adjustment
and stability), and Openness (Imagination with regard to child personality; Mervielde & De
Fruyt, 1999) (being imaginative, creative, having unconventional values).
Over the years, a solid empirical ground has been established supporting the notion
that personality characteristics are an important predictor of functioning (Costa et al., 2019;
McCrae & Costa, 1999). Longitudinal studies show that child and adolescent personality has
far-reaching influences. For example, Shiner and Masten (2012) found that emotional
PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT AND (MAL)ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING 5
stability in children (8-12 years of age) was positively related to academic achievement 10
years later and work competence 20 years later. It is notable, however, that most studies on
the association between personality and functioning approach personality characteristics as
stable features of individuals by measuring personality at one specific point in life in relation
to later outcomes (e.g., Hampson et al., 2007; Shiner & Masten, 2012). However, personality
is in fact not static but changes from childhood on (McCrae & Costa, 1999; Roberts &
DelVecchio, 2000; Roberts, Walton & Viechtbauer, 2006). These changes often happen in
relation to certain life experiences or transitions (Lodi-Smith & Roberts, 2007; Lüdtke et al.,
2011; Wrzus & Roberts, 2017), for example, because of physical and hormonal changes
related to puberty (Paikoff & Brooks-Gunn, 1991), increases in identity formation (Meeus et
al., 1999), or increasing autonomy (Galambos & Costigan, 2003).
Results from several studies indicate that mean-level personality changes from mid-
adolescence into emerging adulthood are directed towards greater maturity (i.e., the five
personality dimensions increase), also referred to as the maturity principle (Caspi et al., 2005;
Klimstra et al., 2009). Increases in personality traits can help individuals to perform better on
age-graded tasks, meaning that changes in personality may relate to the new social roles that
are taken (Social Investment Theory; Roberts et al., 2005). Entering college, starting a paid
job, or becoming involved in romantic relations can require individuals to become more
structured, more organized, and less egocentric (Roberts et al., 2008). In this light, one can
expect that personality changes towards maturity (indicated by increased levels of
extraversion, benevolence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and imagination) are
related to higher levels of adaptive behavior and lower levels of maladaptive behavior. In
sum, the changing nature of personality implies that it is important to study initial levels
(intercepts) and changes (slopes) in Big Five personality dimensions as determinants of later
functioning.
PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT AND (MAL)ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING 6
Besides mean-level changes, studies on changes in personality from adolescence on
show that there are individual differences present in personality change over time (e.g.,
Branje et al., 2006; Klimstra et al., 2009; Van den Akker et al., 2010), which may explain
why some individuals show more maladaptive behaviors, whereas others show more adaptive
behaviors later in life. To our knowledge, few studies focused on individual differences in
Big Five personality development in relation to later (maladaptive) functioning, such as the
study by Van den Akker and colleagues (2010). This study was based on the same study
sample as the current study but conducted in the earlier developmental period of ages 8 to 14
years. Van den Akker and colleagues (2010) reported that decreases in benevolence,
conscientiousness, and emotional stability were related to higher levels of externalizing
problems and decreases in extraversion and emotional stability were associated with more
internalizing problems in adolescents. Our research extends these important initial findings
on personality development in relation to functioning later in life by focusing on the
developmental phase of mid-adolescence into emerging adulthood (ages 14 to 23),
functioning outcomes at a later age (age 25; emerging adulthood), a different measure of
maladaptive functioning (burnout symptoms), and by adding an outcome of adaptive
functioning (happiness).
Personality and Burnout Symptoms
Burnout is most often defined as a chronic stress response, characterized by feelings
of exhaustion and disengagement from one’s job or education (Demerouti et al., 2010;
Maslach et al., 2001). Exhaustion refers to the long-term consequence of intensive affective,
cognitive, or physical stressors. Disengagement comprises distancing from and having
negative attitudes toward the job or education in general or the object and content (Demerouti
et al., 2003). Burnout may have a substantial impact on personal functioning, including
educational or occupational performance, absenteeism, or physical health (Bakker,
PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT AND (MAL)ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING 7
Demerouti & Sanz-Vergel, 2014; Maslach et al., 2001; Salmela-Aro & Read, 2017). In
addition, burnout may spill over to other psychological problems or physical problems (Kim
et al., 2011; Salmela-Aro & Read, 2017). According to Job Demands-Resources (JD-R)
theory (Bakker & Demerouti, 2017; Demerouti et al., 2001), burnout results from a complex
interplay between demands and resources. Demands and (lack of) resources as antecedents of
burnout are most often grouped into organizational, occupational, and individual factors
(Maslach et al., 2001; Swider & Zimmerman, 2010). Within JD-R theory, organizational and
occupational factors, such as time pressure, job control, opportunities for development,
performance feedback, and social support have been studied most often as resources
(Aronsson et al., 2017). Individual factors in relation to burnout, such as personality, have
been suggested to play a major role as well (Bakker & Demerouti, 2017; Bianchi, 2018;
Schaufeli & Taris, 2013; Swider & Zimmerman, 2010). Yet, personality is often overlooked
as, or considered a more distant, predictor of burnout compared to job-related factors (Swider
& Zimmerman, 2010).
Personality traits may predispose individuals to interpret situations as more negatively
and react more negatively in stressful situations, which can result in increased burnout
symptoms (see for a meta-analysis, Swider & Zimmerman, 2010). Individuals low in
emotional stability (i.e. high levels of neuroticism) are generally more anxious, fearful, and
nervous (Costa & McCrae, 1985). This heightened vulnerability to negative stimuli makes
individuals low in emotional stability more prone to interpreting their (work) environment as
more stressful, and therefore more prone to developing burnout symptoms (Bakker et al.,
2006; Swider & Zimmerman, 2010). Further, individuals high in extraversion are more likely
to experience positive emotions, such as optimism and cheerfulness, resulting in more
positive evaluations of their work or education and in turn less burnout symptoms (Mustafa et
al., 2014). Of all five personality traits, emotional stability and extraversion received most
PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT AND (MAL)ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING 8
attention within the burnout research (e.g., Bianchi, 2018; Fornés-Vives et al., 2019), which
underscores the need to examine the other personality dimensions in relation to burnout as
well.
Implementing a Salutogenic View on Functioning: Personality and Happiness
Knowledge on the link between personality and burnout entails information about
maladaptive functioning only, or in other words, the presence of problems in emerging
adulthood. This negativity bias of functioning (i.e., the pathogenic view) characterizes most
of the child, adolescent, and adult developmental and occupational psychology research
(Bakker & Derks, 2010; Marques et al., 2011; Mittelmark et al., 2017). However, the
pathogenic view does not entail the full continuum of functioning, because an individual may
not experience problems and not experience wellbeing at the same time (Westerhof & Keyes,
2010; World Health Organization, 2006). Complementing the pathogenic view by the
salutogenic perspective (i.e., promoting adaptive functioning) yields a more complete picture
of functioning (i.e. the two-continua model of Keyes; Keyes, 2002, 2005, 2014). The
application of a salutogenic view in psychological research is scarce; according to Schaufeli
and Salanova (2007) publications on maladaptation, such as depression, appear to exceed
those on adaptation, such as happiness, by a ratio of 16:1. Since the publication of their study,
the number of studies implementing the salutogenic view increased, but still is limited
(Mittelmark et al., 2017). The salutogenic view is actually reflected when the JD-R model is
explained by two distinct processes that can take place (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007; Jenny et
al., 2016): the positive motivational process and the negative health-impairment process.
Brauchli and colleagues (2015) referred to this salutogenic implementation of the JD-R
model as the JD-R Health Model in which the negative health-impairment process is labeled
as a direct pathogenic path to maladaptive outcomes, such as anxiety or depression (Jenny et
PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT AND (MAL)ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING 9
al., 2016). The positive motivational process is referred to as a direct salutogenic paths to
adaptive outcomes.
Happiness, or subjective wellbeing, is a strong indicator of adaptive functioning in
positive psychology (Ackerman et al., 2018). Happiness consists of a cognitive component
(i.e. life satisfaction) and an affective component (i.e. presence of positive emotions and
absence of negative emotions; Diener, 1984; Diener et al., 1999). A large number of studies
showed that more happiness was related to better functioning across many life domains, such
as friendships, romantic relations, work performance, and educational success (Lyubomirsky
et al., 2005; Oswald et al., 2015). In fact, Lyubomirsky et al. (2005) showed that personality
accounted for as much as 50% of the variance in happiness. A meta-analysis by Steel and
colleagues (2008) on the Big Five personality dimensions found highest correlations for
emotional stability with life satisfaction and negative affect, and for extraversion with
positive affect. Individuals high in extraversion and emotional stability tend to interpret
situations and their environment more positively, resulting in more adaptive functioning, such
as experiencing more happiness (Garcia, 2011; Ozer & Benet-Martinez, 2006). More recent
meta-analytical evidence also revealed that effect sizes were largest specifically for
extraversion and emotional stability, followed by conscientiousness (Anglim et al., 2020).
The two dimensions of benevolence and imagination were less consistently and less strongly
correlated with happiness.
The Current Study
In this study, the link between individual differences in initial levels and in the
development of Big Five personality from adolescence into emerging adulthood (14-23
years) and burnout symptoms and happiness in emerging adulthood (mean age 25 years) is
expect initial levels of extraversion and emotional stability to be negatively related to burnout

symptoms – in the current study represented by disengagement and exhaustion. Second, we
hypothesize that initial levels of extraversion and emotional stability are positively related to
happiness, in the current study represented by life satisfaction and overall affect. Because
benevolence, conscientiousness and imagination are relatively understudied personality
dimensions in relation to burnout symptoms and inconsistently related to the happiness, no a
priori hypotheses are made with regard to their initial levels in relation to both burnout
symptoms and happiness in emerging adulthood. Finally, based on the theoretical
implications of the personality maturity principle, earlier findings on initial levels of
personality in relation to burnout and happiness, and the single study by Van den Akker and
colleagues (2010) examining individual differences in personality development in relation to
maladaptive functioning, we expect stronger increases in all five personality dimensions over
time to be related to less burnout symptoms and more happiness in emerging adults.

Method
Participants and Procedure
The current study is part of the ongoing longitudinal <name study> consisting of nine
waves (1999 – 2018). The study procedures were approved by the <name board>. The
original study sample was randomly selected from 167 schools in <country>. A detailed
description of the study design and recruitment of participants is presented previously (see
e.g., Prinzie et al., 2003). Data from the sixth (2009; Time 1 [T1], N = 449), seventh (2012;
Time 2 [T2], N = 438), eighth (2015; Time 3 [T3], N = 387) and ninth (2018; Time 4 [T4], N
= 367) waves were used as these waves contained the measures of interest. The final sample
(N = 329) consisted of participants from whom information with regard to personality was
available on T1, and T2 or T3 and who participated at T4 (T1 N = 307; T2 N = 313; T3 N =
307; T4 N = 329). Attrition analyses with participants who participated at T1, T2, T3 and T4
(n = 284) compared with participants with missings on either T2 or T3 but not on T1 and T4
(N = 45) showed no significant differences with regard to personality on T1 and sex of the
child. The final sample included 142 boys and 187 girls (mean age T1 = 15.82 years, range
age T1 = 12.92 to 18.25 years, mean age T2 = 18.82, T3 = 21.82, T4 = 24.82).
Measures
Adolescent Big Five personality dimensions. At T1, T2, and T3, adolescents
completed the 144-item Hierarchical Personality Inventory for Children (HiPIC; Mervielde &
De Fruyt, 1999), hierarchically structured under five domains: (1) Extraversion (32 items;
e.g., “Talks to people easily”), (2) Benevolence (40 items; e.g., “Defends the weak”), (3)
Conscientiousness (32 items, e.g., “Carries out work to the last detail”), (4) Emotional
Stability (16 items; e.g., “Has confidence in own abilities”), and (5) Imagination (24 items;
e.g., “Derives pleasure from creating things”). Items were rated on a five-point scale ranging
from 1 (barely characteristic) to 5 (highly characteristic). Mean scores of the items for each
PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT AND (MAL)ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING 12
Big Five personality dimension were used. Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .84 to .92. The
factor structure of the HiPIC has been established and internal consistencies of the domains
are high (Rossier et al., 2007).
Burnout symptoms in emerging adulthood. At T4, participants rated their feelings
of exhaustion and disengagement towards their work/education using the Oldenburg Burnout
Inventory (OLBI; Demerouti et al., 2010; Reis et al., 2015). The OLBI consists of two
subscales: Exhaustion (8 items; “After work/class, I tend to need more time than in the past in
order to relax and feel better”) and Disengagement (8 items; “It happens more and more often
that I talk about my work/study in a negative way”). Items were rated on a four-point scale
ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree). For both scales, mean scores of the
items were used. Two versions of the OLBI were used for participants who were working or
studying: a version that taps into burnout symptoms related to work and a version measuring
academic burnout. For participants who work and study at the same time, the statements were
modified such that they referred to both work and studies. The total number of participants
from whom information on burnout symptoms was used, was based on the sum of 232
participants that were working (Cronbach’s alpha Exhaustion scale = .79, Disengagement
scale = .82), 51 participants that were studying (Cronbach’s alpha Exhaustion scale = .83,
Disengagement scale = .78), and 46 participants combining work and study (Cronbach’s
alpha Exhaustion scale = .81, Disengagement scale = .77). Reliability and validity, and
factorial invariance of the work and academic versions of the OLBI have been established
before (Demerouti & Bakker, 2008; Reis et al., 2015).
Happiness in emerging adulthood. At T4, participants rated their feelings of
happiness by filling out the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS; Arrindell, 1991; Diener et
al., 1985) and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS; Peeters et al., 1996; Watson
et al., 1998). The SWLS taps into the cognitive component of participants and consists of five
PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT AND (MAL)ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING 13
items (e.g. “In most ways my life is close to my ideal”) that were rated on a seven-point scale
ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Sum scores of the items were used
(Pavot & Diener, 2013). Cronbach’s alpha of Life Satisfaction in this sample was .84.
Through the PANAS the affective component of happiness was measured. Positive (10 items;
Cronbach’s alpha = .87; e.g. “inspired”) and negative states (10 items; Cronbach’s alpha =
.89; e.g. “upset”) were assessed on a five-point scale ranging from 1 (very slightly) to 5
(extremely). Similar to the method that was applied before (i.e., Mukolo & Wallston, 2011)
Overall Affect was computed by subtracting the sum score of the negative state items from
the positive state items. This method yielded negative values, therefore we added the lowest
score in the sample to all scores of Overall Affect. Adequate validity has been established for
both the SWLS (Arrindell, 1991) as well as the PANAS (Peeters et al., 1996).
Statistical Analyses
First, to determine personality change, univariate latent growth models were assessed
through Latent Growth Curve (LGM) analyses for each personality dimension separately in
Mplus 8.5 (Muthén & Muthén, 2017). We applied the full information maximum likelihood
(FIML) approach (Schafer, 1997) to deal with missing values. For each personality
dimension, in the first step intercept-only models were fitted in which only the intercept is
specified. These (reference) models were compared with univariate linear growth models that
were fitted for each personality dimension, including an intercept, a linear slope factor, and a
covariance between these factors. The fit indices Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and
the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) were used to assess the adequacy of fit for the growth
models (Bollen & Long, 1993). Fit of the models were compared based on the (Satorra-
Bentler) Chi-Square Difference Test. Mean values and variances of the intercept and slope
factors and intercept-slope covariances were reported for the most parsimonious model.
Estimate significances were reported based on a p value of < .05.
PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT AND (MAL)ADAPTIVE FUNCTIONING 14
Second, through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), it was determined whether
changes in personality dimensions were related to burnout symptoms and happiness in
emerging adulthood. Sex of the participant was added as a covariate. Intercept and slope
factors were included as predictors in the multivariate models if their variances were
significantly different from zero. Outcome variables were standardized before performing the
main analyses. For each personality dimension, intercept and/or slope factors were related to
the burnout and happiness outcomes. Reported estimates are regression coefficients (),
standard errors, and significance for each outcome based on a p value of < .05.

dimensions (Extraversion, Benevolence, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and

significant and negative, indicating that, on average, adolescents became less extraverted and
less emotionally stable from mid-adolescence to emerging adulthood. The significant mean
slopes of Benevolence, Conscientiousness and Imagination were positive and indicated that,
on average, adolescents became more benevolent, conscientious, and imaginative over time.

Emotional Stability ∆χ (1) = 99.54, p < .001; Imagination ∆χ (1) = 99.30, p < .001).

Moreover, the slope variances for Extraversion, Emotional Stability, and Imagination were
significantly different from zero, as confirmed by the Chi-Square Difference Test

(Extraversion ∆χ (1) = 463.65, p < .001; Emotional Stability ∆χ (1) = 387.62, p < .001;

al., 2006). The significant slope variances indicate that the slopes of Extraversion, Emotional
Stability, and Imagination can be included as predictor in the multivariate models (Duncan et
al., 2006).
Associations between Personality (Development) and Burnout Symptoms and
Happiness
In order to examine relations between the five personality factors and burnout
symptoms and happiness in emerging adulthood, five models were fitted for each intercept of
the personality dimensions separately. For Extraversion, Emotional Stability, and
of Extraversion and Emotional Stability were negatively associated with Exhaustion and
higher initial levels of all personality dimensions (except Benevolence) were significantly
related to lower scores on Disengagement. The regression paths between the slopes of
personality and the burnout outcomes showed that stronger increases in Extraversion and
Emotional Stability were associated with lower scores on Exhaustion. In addition, stronger
increases in Extraversion, Emotional Stability, and Imagination were related to lower scores
on Disengagement in emerging adulthood.
Higher initial levels of all five personality domains were related to higher scores on
Life Satisfaction and to higher scores on Overall Affect in emerging adulthood. The
regression paths between the slopes of personality and the happiness outcomes showed that
stronger increases in Extraversion, Emotional Stability, and Imagination were related to
higher scores on both Life Satisfaction and Overall Affect.

Discussion
The current study investigated whether individual differences in initials levels and
development of the Big Five personality dimensions throughout adolescence into emerging
adulthood were related to burnout symptoms and happiness in emerging adulthood. Findings
revealed that increases of extraversion, emotional stability, and imagination throughout
adolescence were related later functioning, above and beyond effects of initial levels of
personality. These findings support our expectation that changes towards maturity in
personality from mid-adolescence are related to more adaptive functioning and less
maladaptive functioning in emerging adulthood. Moreover, we extended the findings of the
study of Van den Akker and colleagues (2010) by showing that development of personality
dimensions were related to maladaptive functioning as well as adaptive functioning and in a
later developmental period (from 14 years onwards). This study broadens our knowledge of
personality (development) as longitudinal antecedent of burnout symptoms and happiness,
and provides novel insights for the fields of personality psychology, occupational psychology,
and positive psychology.
Personality and Burnout Symptoms
We found that initial levels of extraversion, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and
imagination were related to disengagement. In addition, extraversion and emotional stability
were related to exhaustion. Thus, initial levels of conscientiousness and imagination were
negatively related to the disengagement dimension of burnout, but unrelated to exhaustion
from work and/or education. These asynchronous findings might be driven by the explanation
that exhausted individuals are less able to invest effort in their work or education, whereas
disengaged individuals are less willing to invest effort (Bakker & De Vries, 2021).
Imaginative individuals are curious, open to new experiences and desire uniqueness, change,
and variety (Costa & McCrae, 1992). At work, such skills yield more proactive work
behavior, such as more anticipation on and positively adjusting of future goals (Parker et al.,
2006). Such skills promote positive experiences with regard to work or education and
therefore may decrease feelings of disengagement. Since individuals high in
conscientiousness are characterized by a strong self-discipline, effective organization, and
excellent time-management skills (Costa & McCrae, 1992; Kim et al., 2009), they have a
strong work ethic and achievement motivation. These characteristics help highly
conscientious individuals to be fully invested in their work roles. Indeed, previous research on
the link between personality and work engagement (the opposite of burnout) has shown that
conscientiousness is positively related to engagement (Mäkikangas et al., 2013). Regarding
the link between conscientiousness and exhaustion, it should be noted that conscientiousness
helps employees to deal with their work tasks and reach their goals (Bakker et al., 2006), but
will simultaneously cost effort. Those who persist in the face of difficulties do not stop when
feeling tired. Instead, they overrule their fatigue to reach their work-related goals, and will
achieve their goals with fatigue as a side effect (see, Hockey, 1993). In short,
conscientiousness will help individuals to reach their goals which is energizing, but this will
also come at the cost of substantial effort, which depletes resources. The net result is that
conscientiousness and exhaustion are not related.
With regard to personality development, adolescents who became more extraverted,
emotionally stable, and imaginative over time, showed less disengagement towards their work
or education in emerging adulthood. Also, stronger increases in adolescents’ emotional
stability and extraversion (but not imagination) were also related to less feelings of exhaustion
later in life. Hence, in addition to initial levels (stability) of personality, which has received
most attention within research, the current study found that changes in extraversion,
emotional stability, and imagination were related to burnout symptoms. These findings
replicate and extend knowledge from earlier studies on initial levels of personality and
burnout (Bakker et al., 2006; Bianchi, 2018; Swider & Zimmerman, 2010), because the
findings on personality development yield additional and innovative information on the
longitudinal role of personality on burnout symptoms. Our findings confirm the idea that
personality as an individual characteristic is related to burnout symptoms (Bianchi, 2018) and
suggest to consider the role of personality within future studies of the Job Demands-
Resources (JD-R) model (Bakker & Demerouti, 2017; Demerouti et al., 2001). The role of
individual characteristics such as personality, next to job-related factors, may be particularly
important for future research on interventions, as to date, the predominant focus on job related
factors in the JD-R model has provided ample knowledge for practical implications to tailor
interventions on the workplace and organizational level.
Personality and Happiness
Our findings showed that adolescents with higher initial levels on all personality
dimensions were more satisfied regarding their lives and showed more positive affect in
emerging adulthood. Moreover, adolescents who became more extraverted, emotionally
stable, and imaginative over time, were more happy emerging adults compared to their peers.
These findings support the meta-analytical findings of Anglim and colleagues (2020) that
personality dimensions are substantially correlated with happiness and extend this knowledge
by providing evidence for relations changes in personality and happiness, and also on the
long-term. Furthermore, our findings indicate that personality is not only important for
functioning on the work or educational level, but entails a longitudinal indicator for general
adaptive functioning in emerging adulthood as well, supporting implementation of a
salutogenic view within the JD-R model. Specifically, this salutogenic approach allowed us to
build further on the JD-R model towards a JD-R Health model (Jenny et al., 2016). Also, our
findings on personality (development) and burnout symptoms and happiness suggest that
personality seems to play a role in both of the otherwise distinct pathogenic and salutogenic
processes. As our findings support the JD-R Health Model, we emphasize the value of adding
a salutogenic view on functioning, in addition to the well-studied subject of maladaptive
functioning (Jenny et al., 2016).
In sum, our results highlight the importance to consider the role of maladaptive and
adaptive outcomes in future research and interventions in order to understand why certain
emerging adults thrive, whereas others experience more difficulties. The study of adaptive
outcomes within research, policy, and practice can promote our knowledge on individual
functioning (Seligman, 2002), which may provide insights for (re)development of prevention
and intervention programs.
Personality Development as a Longitudinal Predictor of (Mal)Adaptive Functioning
Our findings showed that conclusions based on initial levels of personality do not
convey the complete picture of the longitudinal role of personality. Based on initial levels of
personality we might expect that an individual might show more, for example, burnout
symptoms in emerging adulthood. However, if certain personality traits increase, this
individual might experience less burnout symptoms on the long term. In this way,
expectations based on initial levels of personality can change because personality develops
over time. Knowledge on personality development in relation to later functioning is important
in theoretical and practical terms. Hill and colleagues (2019) and Roberts and colleagues
(2017) urged to consider the effects of personality development on later functioning, in order
to understand the individual throughout life. In their meta-analysis on personality change
through interventions Roberts and colleagues (2017) provided clinical evidence for the
benefits of psychotherapy for personality change, particularly for emotional stability and
extraversion. Our findings extend this knowledge and show that (individual differences) in
these changes in personality are beneficial on the longer-term, as they are related to more or
less maladaptive and adaptive functioning later in life. By building forth on the
recommendations of Hill and colleagues (2019) and Roberts and colleagues (2017), our study
provides theoretical insights into certain longitudinal trajectories that put individuals in more
vulnerable positions for future problematic functioning or, on the other hand, that promote
successful functioning. Additionally, despite the small effect sizes, these findings on
personality development may still play an important role in intervention programs on
employee/student wellbeing as small effect sizes can still indicate substantial benefits within
interventions (Lucassen et al., 2011; Rose, 1981). Also, burnout has a spillover effect on
various domains of functioning (Kim et al., 2011; Salmela-Aro & Read, 2017). Earlier studies
showed that even mild burnout symptoms were related to depression, long-term employee
absenteeism, sleep problems, and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and even all-
cause mortality (Ahola, 2007; Ahola et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011). Hence, for public health,
moderate changes of moderate risk factors are beneficial, which is especially important to
take into account, as burnout is considered to be a large societal problem on the general
population level (Bakker & De Vries, 2021).
Strengths and Limitations
Most studies on the long-term relation between personality and functioning assessed
personality at one time point in life (initial levels), thereby implicitly assuming that
personality is static. However, the changing nature of personality implies that it is important
to also study personality development as determinant of later functioning. This study is one of
the first studies that examined individual differences in initial levels and development of
personality in relation to burnout symptoms and happiness in emerging adulthood. A second
strength of the study relates to our longitudinal design which allowed us to study personality
development across a considerable age range from 14 to 23 years of age. Thirdly, besides our
focus on personality development, we addressed the understudied topic of happiness as a
measure of adaptive functioning in order to implement a positive psychological perspective
on functioning. A next step for future research may be to extend the current study design and
examine what factors explain the heterogeneity in personality development from
midadolescence onwards in relation to burnout symptoms and happiness. The moderating role
of environmental (e.g. parenting or job pressure) and biological factors (heritability) might be
interesting to explore. Earlier studies suggested that personality changes are driven by
parenting (Shiner & Caspi, 2003), for example, increases in benevolence and
conscientiousness have been found to be related to increases in positive parenting and
decreases in negative parenting (Van den Akker et al., 2014). In addition, the meta-analysis
by Vukasović and Bratko (2015) showed that almost 40% of individual differences in
personality are affected by genetics, compared to 60% by environmental influences.
Besides the strengths, some limitations of the current study need to be considered.
Firstly, this study was based on self-report data, which runs the risk of single-reporter bias.
Second, the dataset used in the current study only provided information on burnout and
happiness at one timepoint: in emerging adulthood. A more precise estimation of the effects
would have been retrieved by controlling for baseline measures of the outcome variables, as
individuals may have differed in their initial levels and, consequently, in their rate of change
of burnout symptoms and happiness.
Conclusion
The current study provides important knowledge on adolescent personality as an early
determinant of (mal)adaptive functioning in emerging adulthood, by showing that initial
levels and development of personality from age 14 to 23 were related to burnout symptoms
and happiness in emerging adulthood. The findings were in line with earlier empirical support
for the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) theory (Bakker & Demerouti, 2017; Demerouti et al.,
2001). Also, the results provide evidence for the JD-R health model (Jenny et al., 2016),
thereby emphasizing the value of adding a positive psychological view on functioning. Our
findings that development of extraversion, emotional stability, and imagination were related
to less burnout symptoms and more happiness in emerging adulthood, provide buildings
blocks for early detection and intervention purposes. In sum, our findings indicate the
importance of studying personality development as determinants of later functioning, above
and beyond effects of initial levels of personality.
