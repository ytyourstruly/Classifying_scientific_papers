The Swiss Corona Stress Study - v2021-11
Abstract
This paper reports the results of the 4th survey of the Swiss Corona Stress Study. During the
survey period from November 16-28, 2021, 11167 people from all over Switzerland
participated in the anonymous online survey.
Stress factors: There were major differences between the group of vaccinated persons (58
percent of respondents) and the group of unvaccinated persons in terms of the stress factors
associated with the subjective perception of stress. The greatest differences were found in
the stress caused by measures such as the certificate requirement, which the majority of the
unvaccinated perceived as stressful, while the majority of the vaccinated perceived it as
relieving. The burden of conflicts in the family, among friends or at the workplace due to
corona measures or vaccination was high among both vaccinated and unvaccinated
persons. However, it was significantly higher among the latter. There were also large
differences - here with a higher burden among vaccinated persons - in the fear about the
health consequences of Covid-19, such as the concern that someone in the closest circle
could become seriously ill. Fears of suffering from Long Covid in case of an infection, or that
children might bring the coronavirus home and infect parents or grandparents, were also
more prevalent among vaccinated than unvaccinated respondents. Among respondents with
their own children between the ages of 4 and 11 (a total of 2079 people), only 17 percent
among vaccinated parents were not at all afraid that their child will become infected with the
Depressive symptoms: The proportion of respondents with moderately severe or severe
depressive symptoms (PHQ>=15) was 19 percent, with vaccination status not playing a
relevant role. In April 2020 (lockdown), this proportion was 9 percent; in May 2020 (partial
lockdown), 12 percent; and in November 2020 (second wave), 18 percent.
Risk factors for moderately severe or severe depressive symptoms were:
- Young age: Severe depressive symptoms were most common in the youngest group (14 to
24 years old), with a share of 33 percent. Among participants who attended school or
college/university, depressive symptoms were most strongly related to stress from pressure
to perform at school.
The Swiss Corona Stress Study - v2021-11
- Financial losses: Individuals whose financial reserves decreased during the pandemic
were more likely to experience major depressive symptoms (32 percent) than those with
unchanged or increased reserves (13 percent).
- Previous mental health issues: Individuals with mental health problems prior to the
pandemic are more likely to experience major depressive symptoms (34 percent) than
individuals who reported having no mental health problems prior to the pandemic (14
percent).
Substance use: Among those taking tranquilizers or sleeping pills (3544 persons), 53.6
percent reported an increase, 3.5 percent a decrease, and 42.9 percent no change in use
alcohol, or cannabis. The extent of use of these substances is related to the severity of
stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms.
Introduction
In spring 2020 we set up the Swiss Corona Stress Study online survey to gain a better
understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health (de Quervain et
al., 2020a). We capture a range of demographic aspects as well as perceived stress,
depression and anxiety levels. Here, we report on survey 4 that ran from November 16, 2021
until November 28, 2021, when COVID-19 infection rates were on the rise again in
Switzerland. All data was collected anonymously. Our previous surveys covered the periods
April 2020 (during first COVID-19 pandemic wave; Survey 1), May to June 2020 (after first
COVID-19 pandemic wave; Survey 2), and November 2020 (during second COVID-19
pandemic wave Survey 3). Each survey collected data from over 10,000 participants.

Methods
Study design and participants
We conducted a follow-up anonymous Swiss Corona Stress Study survey (Survey 4) to map
the impact of the fifth COVID-19 pandemic wave on mental well-being in Switzerland. This
current survey collected data between 16 and 28 November 2021 from all regions of
Switzerland through referrals to the study by media reports and social media advertisement.
Our previous Swiss Corona Stress Study surveys were conducted between April 6 and April
8, 2020 during the first lock-down in Switzerland, survey 2 between the May 11 and June 1,
2020, during the partial lifting of measures, the survey 3 was run during the second upsurge
of the pandemic from the November 11 until November 19, 2020.
For the current survey, participants were included if they never took part in our previous
surveys, lived in Switzerland and were at least 14 years old. 11,167 participants fulfilled the
inclusion criteria. No study protocol approval by the local Ethics committee was necessary,
as the survey was anonymized. All participants gave prior written informed consent for
participation. Participants did not receive any monetary compensation.
Procedure and outcomes
The procedure was identical to the procedure of the previous Swiss Corona Stress Study
choose one of three possible national languages, German, French or Italian. If participants
were interested in taking part in the survey, they were directed to the questionnaire. The first
page of the survey contained study information and informed consent. Only after agreement
to the informed consent, the survey started and normally could be completed within 15
assessment. Only the day of participation was recorded in SoSci Survey, while IP-addresses
and timestamps were not recorded.
In the first part of the survey we collected sociodemographic and further relevant data
including gender, age, nationality, country of residence, living situation, family status,
religiousness, burden of childcare, highest educational level, profession, relevant
pre-existing physical or psychiatric conditions, coronavirus vaccination status, coronavirus
diagnostic status, potential symptoms related to the coronavirus, fears related to the
The Swiss Corona Stress Study - v2021-11
coronavirus, acceptance of taken federal measures, burdens arising from the federal
measures, changes in consumption of food / gaming / drugs / sleeping pills and tranquilizers,
changes in eating and shopping routines, changed habits. Vaccinated people were
additionally asked about the burden of the risk of getting sick despite being vaccinated, while
unvaccinated people were asked about potential reasons for not being vaccinated.
Afterwards, the following outcomes of interest were assessed: stress level, anxiety, and
depressive symptoms during the two weeks immediately before the survey. Stress and
anxiety levels were assessed using 6-point Likert scales ranging from 0 (not at all) to 5
(extremely strong). Depressive scores were assessed by the “Patient Health Questionnaire
9” – PHQ-9. PHQ-9 is a 9-question self-rating questionnaire to screen for the presence and
severity of depression. We used the German, French and Italian translations of the PHQ-9.
In addition, for participants who opted in, the survey continued with a
Obsessive−Compulsive Inventory−Revised (OCI-R) questionnaire using the German version
published by (Gönner et al., 2008), and the French and Italian translations thereof. At the
end of the survey, participants received automated recommendations for stress reduction on
the basis of the information given in the survey, such as performing physical activities or
mindfulness exercises. All questions needed to be answered in order to complete the survey.
This survey also included short cognitive tests and questions about symptoms of long covid.
The results of these measures will be reported separately.
Statistical analyses
Stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms of survey 4: relation to
socio-demographic variables, changeable behaviors, burdens, and
reliefs
We applied linear models in combination with ANOVAs for nominal variables, Pearson
correlations for interval variables and Spearman’s rank correlations for ordinal variables. For
a first overview, the statistical models consisted of one dependent variable (one of the main
outcome variables) and one independent variable. In the case of linear models, the strength
of the relationships was obtained by extracting the correlation value r from each
corresponding linear model (i.e. normalized regression coefficient). We only report
relationships with at least a small effect size (|r| ≥ 0.1).
These analyses we conducted separately for vaccinated and unvaccinated participants.

Comparison of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms scores
between November 2020 and November 2021
We compared outcomes (stress, depression and anxiety) between November 2021 (Survey
4) and November 2020 (Survey 3) by means of Wilcoxon tests. Differences exceeding a
Wilcoxon effect size |r| ≥ 0.1 were considered as significant. Comparisons were also
performed after linear model adjustment of each outcome for socio-demographic factors
(age, gender, education, religious belief, residency, history of prior psychiatric disorder and
canton).
Comparison of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms scores
between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants
We compared outcomes (stress, depression and anxiety) between participants having
received at least one vaccine dose and unvaccinated participants by means of Wilcoxon
tests. Differences exceeding a Wilcoxon effect size |r| ≥ 0.1 were considered as significant.
Comparisons were also performed after linear model adjustment of each outcome for
socio-demographic factors (age, gender and history of prior psychiatric disorder).
Identification of factors related to moderately severe and severe
depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 15)
A logistic regression model was built between socio-demographic factors and the
categorization of depressive symptoms into moderately severe and severe (PHQ-9 score
≥15) and other (PHQ-9 score <15). Participants reporting gender different from male / female
were excluded from this analysis as well as participants reporting unspecific household,
yielding a total of N=10’964 participants. A first logistic regression model was built
considering age, gender, education (university / not university), religious belief (believer/not
believer), residency (countryside, city, agglomeration), history of prior psychiatric disorder
and canton (German, French or Italian speaking). Only main effects showing significant
statistical association and at least one post-hoc pairwise comparison reaching Cohen’s D
effect size > |0.2| (square root of log(OR)*3/pi) were interpreted. The effect of financial
consequences (loss vs. unchanged/more) was evaluated next within this model. A second
logistic regression analysis was performed considering profession (students/pupils/in
The Swiss Corona Stress Study - v2021-11
training, job seeking, retired, in invalidity, house-wife/husband, workers in a sector financially
impacted by the crisis, other workers), rather than age. Likewise, the effect of financial
consequences (loss vs. unchanged/more) was next evaluated within this model.
Statistical significance of main effects was assessed by likelihood ratio test between the full
model and a model discarding the variable of interest and subsequent evaluation of
Nagelkerke’s R2. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons between levels of each factor were
performed using least-square means method as implemented in the R package lsmeans.
Marginal effects within a given model were obtained using the ggeffect function implemented
in the R package ggeffect. All confidence intervals are reported at 95% threshold.
In order to compare the magnitude of the identified effects to the effects identified in Survey
3 (November 2020), we considered logistic regression models testing for evidence of
multiplicative interactions between each variable and ‘time point’ (November 2020,
November 2021). We also tested for evidence of additive interactions (assessing differences
in prevalences between groups, across time points) using binomial linear regression. These
latter analyses were conducted using the R package blm. Predicted percentages per
interaction term were obtained using the R predict function, under a binomial regression
model considering only the interaction term of interest.
Role of funding source
The study was funded by the University of Basel. All authors had full access to all the data in
the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. None of the
authors had any conflict of interest.

Results
Demographics of the study population
A total of 11167 participants were included in our study. All participants lived in Switzerland,
87.1% had Swiss nationality. The age of the participants ranged from 14-101 (median age
41 years, mean age 41.9 years, sd 13.1). Overall, 27.1% of the participants were male,
72.1% female. 49.2% of the participants had no children, 25.2% had at least one child
younger than 13 years; 40.9% had a university degree, 2.5% a doctorate, 29.8% completed
an apprenticeship.
At the time of the survey 7.2% of the participants reported to be in full-time education, 1.9%
to be in an apprenticeship, 5.2% to study at university and 73.9% to currently work, 2.9% to
seek a job, 5.5% to receive a pension, 2.2% to receive disabled persons benefits.
Of the participants in this study, 58.2% reported to be vaccinated at least once, 50.9%
vaccinated twice, 2.2% three times. 13% reported testing positive for a Corona virus
infection at least once.
Comparison of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms
scores between November 2020 and November 2021
Participants reported stress levels of similar magnitude as those reported by participants
during the second pandemic wave - November 2020 (de Quervain et al., 2020b) (Nov.2021:
difference was observed between time points in reported levels of anxiety (Nov.2021: mean
= 2.0, s.d. = 1.7; Nov.2020: mean = 2.0, s.d = 1.7, Wilcoxon R = 0.001). Likewise, no
difference in depressive symptoms scores was observed between the two time points
(Nov.2021: mean = 8.6, s.d. = 6.3; Nov.2020: mean = 8.2, s.d. = 6.6, Wilcoxon R = 0.05).
Similar results were observed under adjustment for socio-demographic factors (see
Methods) (Stress: Wilcoxon R = 0.08; Anxiety: Wilcoxon R = 0.024; depressive symptoms
score: Wilcoxon R = 0.08).
The Swiss Corona Stress Study - v2021-11
Comparison of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms
scores between vaccinated and unvaccinated
We observed slightly lower stress levels in participants having received at least one
vaccination dose (n=6499) as compared to unvaccinated participants (vaccinated:
mean=2.8, s.d.=1.6; unvaccinated: mean=3.2, s.d. =1.6; Wilcoxon R = -0.15). This difference
remains under adjustment for age, gender, and presence of prior psychiatric disorder
(Wilcoxon R = -0.13). Notably, very strong stress levels were reported for 16% of vaccinated
participants as compared to 25% of unvaccinated participants.
In terms of anxiety levels or depressive symptoms scores, no difference was observed
between vaccination groups that exceed at least small effect size (Wilcoxon R < 0.1).
Burden variables related to stress
We identified burdens variables associated with stress levels (|r|>0.1) in either vaccinated or
categories, the strongest associations were observed for burden due to conflicts in the
family/friends/workplace due to coronavirus/vaccination with higher magnitude for
unvaccinated (vaccinated r = 0.34, unvaccinated r = 0.45) or independent of coronavirus,
with higher magnitude for vaccinated (vaccinated r = 0.27, unvaccinated r = 0.17). For both
vaccinated and unvaccinated participants burdens linked to financial consequences
(vaccinated r = 0.23, unvaccinated r = 0.27) or decrease in financial reserve (vaccinated r =
0.20; unvaccinated r = 0.19) were associated with stress levels. While levels of stress in
vaccinated participants were globally associated with fear variables such as the fear that
someone from the close circle could get seriously ill with the coronavirus (r = 0.23), these
Levels of stress in unvaccinated participants were more strongly related to the burden of
certificate obligation (r = 0.17) as compared to vaccinated participants (r = 0.11), whereas
levels of stress for both vaccinated and unvaccinated participants correlated with burdens of
restriction in personal freedom (vaccinated r = 0.20, unvaccinated r = 0.17).
Importantly, we observed strong differences in the pattern of responses between vaccinated
The Swiss Corona Stress Study - v2021-11
Associations between stress levels and socio-demographic factors, measures perceptions,
and group specific burden and fear (e.g. school related, loneliness related) are reported in
Tables 2 & 3 for vaccinated and unvaccinated participants respectively.
Current obsessive compulsive symptoms
We asked participants if they were suffering from more compulsions compared to before the
corona crisis (e.g. washing, checking that doors are locked). This question ranged from 0
(not at all) to 5 (very strong). Increased suffering from compulsions was related to higher
current stress levels (r = 0.32), anxiety levels (r = 0.39), and depressive symptoms (r = 0.46).
Overall, 31.9% of participants reported having more obsessive compulsive symptoms (mean
increase = 2.3 units, sd = 1.3). Participants reporting more obsessive symptoms had
significantly more depressive symptoms (mean = 12.3, sd = 6.4) than participants reporting
an unchanged level of obsessive compulsive symptoms (mean = 6.9, sd = 5.5, Wilcoxon r =
0.39).
Change in consumption behavior
We asked participants if the Covid-19 pandemic changed their consumption of specific
substances / objects (from “-5 = much less” to “+5 much more”). Within the participants who
used the specific substance/object: 53.6% reported having a higher consumption of
sleeping/calming tablets than before the pandemic (less = 3.5%, unchanged = 42.9%, N
consumers = 3544), 70.4% consumed more social media (less = 4.2%, unchanged = 25.3%,
N consumers = 10854), 45.7% smoked more (less = 9.3%, unchanged = 44.9%, N
consumers = 4494), 58.4% consumed more TV (less = 6.0%, unchanged = 35.6%, N
consumers = 9808), 54.2% played more video games (less = 4.0%, unchanged = 41.8%, N
consumers = 4564), 36.7% consumed more cannabis (less = 6.2%, unchanged = 57.2%, N
consumers = 2111), 38.8% consumed more alcohol (less = 15.2%, unchanged = 46.0%, N
consumers = 8044), 16.7% consumed more other drugs (less = 8.3%, unchanged = 75.0%,
N consumers = 1498), and 26.9% eat more food (less = 7.4%, unchanged = 65.7%, N
consumers = 11167). However, shopping behavior did not change (more = 28.8%,
unchanged = 42.7%, less = 28.8%, N = 11167).
With the exception of “other drugs”, the change in consumption behavior of all these
substances/objects was related to current stress level (pearson correlation: sleeping/calming
tablets = 0.36; social media = 0.30; smoking = 0.27; TV = 0.24; gaming = 0.24; cannabis =
0.20; alcohol = 0.19; food = 0.16; shopping = 0.12), anxiety level (pearson correlation:
sleeping/calming tablets = 0.38; social media = 0.28; smoking = 0.24; TV = 0.22; gaming =
0.20; cannabis = 0.14; alcohol = 0.16; food = 0.13; shopping = 0.09), and depressive

symptoms (pearson correlation: sleeping/calming tablets = 0.46; social media = 0.35;
smoking = 0.32; TV = 0.32; gaming = 0.32; cannabis = 0.28; alcohol = 0.26; food = 0.20;
Moderately severe and severe depressive symptoms
(PHQ-9≥15): Relation to socio-demographic factors
The proportion of participants reporting clinically relevant depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥15)
in this survey (18.8%) did not significantly differ from the proportion observed in survey 3
during the second pandemic wave (November 2020: 18.4%)(Cramer’s V < 0.01). The
proportion of participants with clinically relevant PHQ-9 scores thus remained considerably
higher than the percentage observed before the first pandemic wave (3.4%, see (de
Quervain et al., 2020a)).
We examined the association of high PHQ-9 (≥15) with socio-demographic factors, namely
gender, age group, household (living alone, not alone), religious belief (believer, not
believer), residency (city, agglomeration, countryside), education (university, not university),
report of prior psychiatric disorder, Swiss canton (German speaking, Italian speaking, or
French speaking)(see Methods). Profession and age group being highly overlapping,
professional status was not considered in this first analysis.
Using logit regression, we observed significant overall effects of prior psychiatric disorder
(Nagelkerke R2 = 5.5% , p = 9.3e-81) and age group (Nagelkerke R2 = 3.6% , p = 6.4e-50)
on the prevalence of PHQ-9≥15 depressive symptoms. Specifically, participants reporting
prior psychiatric disorder showed an increased rate of moderately severe and severe
of higher depressive symptoms also decreased with increasing age, with an estimated
marginal prevalence of 30.8% [CI:27.8-34%] in individuals less than 25 years old and 4.9%
magnitude as those observed in survey 3, November 2020 (time inc. November 2020 and
6-A).
Unlike in survey 3, no significant differences in prevalence of depressive symptoms was
We next considered a model accounting for loss in financial reserve during the pandemic
(less vs. more-unchanged). The effect of financial reserve was significant (Nagelkerke R2 =
5.8%, p = 6.8e-86), with participants reporting loss in financial reserve at higher risk than
other individuals (OR = 2.82 [CI: 2.54-3.12]). This effect is consistent with observations from
The Swiss Corona Stress Study - v2021-11
survey 3, with yet slightly higher magnitude as compared to November 2020 (time by finance
interaction p= 3.4e-03, financial reserve decrease in November 2020 OR = 2.28
We next considered a model considering professional status (students/pupils/in training,
seeking for a job, in invalidity, workers in a sector financially impacted by the crisis, other
workers, housewives/husbands, retired) rather than age. Consistent with observations from
survey 3, we identified a significant effect of profession on the prevalence of clinically
relevant depressive symptoms (Nagelkerke R2 = 2.7%, p = 1.96e-35), with notably lower
prevalence in retired participants as compared to other groups, and higher prevalence in
searching for a job (OR: 2.49 [CI:1.72-3.60] p = 7.6e-12), in invalidity (OR: 1.86
[CI:1.23-2.84], p = 2.4e-04), or working in a sector financially impacted by the crisis (OR:
Overall, these results suggest that similar to observations from survey 3 in November 2020,
younger age and financial loss due to the pandemic are independently associated with the
prevalence of moderately severe to severe depressive scores, while no effect of Swiss
canton was observed in survey 4.
Burdens related to current depressive symptoms in pupils,
apprentices and students of the age group 14-24 years
As we observed the highest proportion of individuals with moderately severe or severe
depressive symptoms in the youngest age group (14-24 years), we analyzed which burden
factors were related to depressive symptoms in pupils-apprentices-students within this age
The highest associations were observed for variables related to school pressure (increase in
pressure to perform: r = 0.43) and worries about the future (worry to get poorer education
due to the pandemic: r = 0.43).
Depressive symptoms were also related to burden due to conflicts in family/friends related to
corona measures (r = 0.27) or independent of corona measures (r = 0.25). Consistent with
observations in the entire population, within this age group, higher depressive symptoms
correlated with decreased financial reserve (r = 0.26).
Finally, depressive symptoms were also related to the burden of personal freedom
restrictions (r = 0.16) and fear of catching the virus (r = 0.16) or fear of death of a relative
due to coronavirus (r = 0.11).

Reasons for not being vaccinated
We asked all unvaccinated participants for their reasons not to be vaccinated, multiple
answers were possible. Only a small fraction of all respondents (1,1%) stated not having had
the opportunity to get vaccinated, or having fear of injections (6.1%). The most frequently
chosen reasons for not getting vaccinated were "because I doubt the effectiveness of the
vaccination" (69.4%), "because of fear of side effects" (56.6%), and “protest against
