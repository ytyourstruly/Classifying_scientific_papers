Abstract
Non-arbitrary phenomena in language, such as systematic association in the form-meaning interface,
have been widely reported in the literature. Exploiting such systematic associations previous studies
have demonstrated that pseudowords can be indicative of meaning. However, whether semantic
activation from words and pseudowords is supported by the very same processes, activating a
common semantic memory system, is currently not known. Here, we take advantage of recent
progresses from computational linguistics models allowing to induce meaning representations for
out-of-vocabulary strings of letters via domain-general associative-learning mechanisms applied to
natural language. We combined these models with data from priming tasks, in which participants are
showed two strings of letters presented sequentially one after the other and are then asked to indicate
if the latter is a word or a pseudoword. In Experiment 1 we re-analyzed the data of the largest
behavioral database on semantic priming, while in Experiment 2 we ran an independent replication
on a new language, Italian, controlling for a series of possible confounds. Results were consistent
across the two experiments and showed that the prime-word meaning interferes with the semantic
pattern elicited by the target pseudoword (i.e., at increasing estimated semantic relatedness between
prime word and target pseudoword, participants’ reaction times increased and accuracy decreased).
These findings indicate that the same associative mechanisms governing word meaning also subserve
the processing of pseudowords, suggesting in turn that human semantic memory can be conceived as
a distributional system that builds upon a general-purpose capacity of extracting knowledge from
complex statistical patterns.
Keywords: semantic priming, pseudowords, statistical learning, distributional semantic model,
semantic memory.
Introduction
Language is a system of communication that uses symbols to convey deep and often complex
meanings. These symbols are words, whose forms have no apparent a-priori connection with their
meanings: the mapping between word form (e.g., cat) and its associated meaning (i.e., small four-
legged mammal from the family of Felidae) is purely arbitrary and thus dependent mainly (or only)
on cultural conventions. This theoretical view on meaning has been formally proposed at the
beginning of the XX Century (e.g., De Saussure, 1916), but its assumptions can be traced back to
Plato’s writings, especially to the Cratylus.
Whether the relationship between word form and meaning is purely arbitrary or not has been at the
center of an intense dispute for decades, which is still nowadays igniting a fervent debate (for a
discussion see: Dingemanse et al., 2015). Against this conventional perspective, indeed, it has been
argued that the principle of arbitrariness would account only partly for form-to-meaning
correspondences, with recent research providing increasing evidence for two common types of non-
arbitrary relationships in language: namely, iconicity and systematicity (Dingemanse et al., 2015).
Iconicity, also referred to as sound-symbolism (e.g., Köhler, 1929; Sapir, 1929), refers to
the resemblance-based mapping between proprieties of linguistic form and meaning: that is,
properties of linguistic form can resemble their referent in some ways, as in the case of onomatopoeic
words or prosodic modulation during speech (e.g., a speaker saying taaaall for emphasizing the
height of a particularly tall skyscraper; Perniss & Vigliocco, 2014). Beyond iconicity, systematic
mapping in the form-meaning interface have been widely reported, referring to reliable statistical
relationships between sublexical structures and semantic features (e.g., Nölle et al., 2018).
Both iconic and systematic patterns are fundamental for early-age word learning (Imai et al., 2008;
Monaghan et al., 2011; Monaghan & Roberts, 2021; Nielsen & Dingemanse, 2021), scaffolding the
production and comprehension of language (Perry et al., 2018). From early after birth, humans are
indeed particularly good at detecting statistical regularities in the (language) environment (Romberg
& Saffran, 2010), with this ability likely being crucial also during adulthood and for the whole
lifespan, especially considering that language users constantly learn new words (Brysbaert et al.,
2016). Language use is indeed fundamentally contextual and probabilistic, with linguistic context
exerting a pervasive influence on the form and content of human communication (Ramscar, 2019).
In line with this possibility, supporting the idea that systematic regularities in language can be
indicative of meaning, several studies have shown that, when processing new words or words from
an unfamiliar language, speakers exploit form-related cues to activate meaning information (Cassani
et al., 2020; Forster & Hector, 2002; Louwerse & Qu, 2017). In principle, therefore, assigning
meaning to new words could be driven by nuanced systematic form-to-meaning cues (Cassani et al.,
2020), that are not necessarily characterized in linguistic terms (e.g., sublexical units like morphemes)
on an explicit level. This is also indirectly supported by recent evidence demonstrating that, in a
lexical decision task, the rejection times for pseudowords are modulated by their semantic
neighborhood density, that is the average distance between the target stimulus and its 5 closest
semantic neighbors, as estimated via distributional semantic models (DSMs) (Hendrix & Sun, 2021).
DSMs are indeed particularly well suited to quantitatively characterize meaning, as they are
conceived as computationally implemented theories of human semantic representations, building on
word distributions in language experience (Günther et al., 2019; Landauer & Dumais, 1997).
In particular, DSMs represent word meanings as high-dimensional numerical vectors, induced from
large amounts of natural language data: the assumption at the core of these models is the distributional
hypothesis, according to which contexts in which words occur can approximate their meanings
(Harris, 1954) Hence, words with similar meanings (i.e., with a similar distributional pattern across
linguistic contexts) are mapped to nearby points in a semantic space (Günther et al., 2019). Critically,
DSMs have been shown to be impressively high-performing across a wide range of psychological
tasks such as multiple-choice tests (Bullinaria & Levy, 2012), word categorization (Baroni & Lenci,
2010), word relatedness ratings (Bruni et al., 2014), word naming and lexical decision (Marelli &
Amenta, 2018), semantic priming (Günther et al., 2016), recognition memory (Gatti et al., 2021),
thoroughly accounting for human performance (for a review see: Mandera et al., 2017). Importantly,
recent progress in DSMs provide us with a convenient way to induce representations for sub-word
information: fastText (Bojanowski et al., 2017) is, in fact, a DSM that can quantify the distributional
pattern of sub-word information in natural language. The benefit of this approach is that each verbal
stimulus (e.g., a word) is modeled as a sum of vectors representing the sequences of n contiguous
letters (labeled as n-grams) composing it: as such, in principle fastText can also be used to
approximate the “meaning” of pseudowords, that is the semantic patterns that an unfamiliar letter
string can elicit.
Although previous studies have shown that pseudowords can be indicative of meaning, whether the
semantic underpinnings of words and pseudowords rely on the same cognitive processes, and hence
whether they both activate the same semantic system, is currently not known. Indeed, previous studies
mainly asked participants to make overt or covert decisions on whether a target string of letters is a
correctly spelled word in a reference language, as in the lexical decision tasks (e.g., Hendrix & Sun,
2021). Yet, in a simple lexical decision paradigm, pseudowords are presented in isolation and it is
thus not possible to probe whether their elaboration would tap into the same source of semantic
information subserving word processing; rather, semantic effects for pseudowords as the ones
observed by Hendrix and Sun (2021) could emerge from ad-hoc, strategical processes triggered by
the attempt of making sense of the meaningless, with not much in common with the comprehension
of actual words. In order to put this aspect to test, here we consider whether the semantic processing
of a word can modulate a subsequent pseudoword-elicited meaning activation. We relied on the
priming task, in which participants are shown two strings of letters presented sequentially one after
the other (with the former being referenced as the prime and the latter as the target) and are then
asked to indicate whether the latter is a word or a pseudoword. Priming tasks can be used to
investigate the effects induced by the semantic similarity between the prime and target words (Draine
& Greenwald, 1998; Xavier Alario et al., 2000). For instance, it has been shown that when prime and
target word pairs are semantically related (e.g., doctor – physician), participants’ responses are faster
compared with when they are unrelated (e.g., doctor – window). Crucially, DSMs have been shown
to be particularly efficient in predicting participants’ performance in priming tasks (Günther et al.,
2016; Jones et al., 2006; Marelli, 2017). In DSMs, each word is represented by a vector indexing a
position within a common semantic space: hence, the closer the semantic distance between the vector
activated by the prime word and the one activated by the target word, the faster the participants’
response.
In priming tasks, researchers have mostly investigated semantic effects by looking at participants’
performance when judging (meaningful) verbal stimuli (i.e., words). While previous studies have
demonstrated that both words and pseudowords can prime orthographically similar items (Rueckl &
Olds, 1993; Stark & McClelland, 2000), the idea of a semantic priming induced on target
pseudowords by prime words was simply inconceivable from both theoretical (i.e., pseudowords do
not have any meaning and, therefore, do not have corresponding representations in semantic memory)
and practical (i.e., it was impossible to operationalize whether a pseudoword is semantically related
or not to a word) standpoints. The priming task is thus the ideal tool to investigate whether the
processing of words and pseudowords can be traced back to common semantic processes and whether
participants “search” for a meaning for both words and pseudowords within a common semantic
space.
In Experiment 1, we first analyzed the data of the Semantic Priming Project (Hutchison et al., 2013),
the largest database available of priming data, by predicting participants’ response latencies and
accuracy using semantic relatedness values between the word prime and the pseudoword target as
extracted from fastText. In Experiment 2, we ran an independent replication on a new language
(Italian), critically controlling for a series of confounding variables (e.g., orthographic similarity and
morphological structure). If the processing of words and pseudowords is supported by the same
associative mechanisms operating over a common semantic space, we should expect a more impaired
performance for pseudowords that are more semantically related to prime words, as the larger
semantic activation would make it more difficult to judge the target as a pseudoword. That is, when
participants have to judge the meaning of a pseudoword, their performance should be affected by the
semantic pre-activation elicited by the prime word, with such interference being more pronounced
when the pattern activated by the prime word overlaps more with the one activated by the target
pseudoword.
Experiment 1: Analysis of the Semantic Priming Project megastudy
Methods
Materials
We analyzed lexical-decision data from the semantic priming project (SPP; Hutchison et al., 2013),
a megastudy including response latencies from 768 subjects for 1,661 English target words and 1,665
target pseudowords, preceded by different prime words. In the SPP, each experimental trial began
with a fixation cross presented in the center of the screen, followed by a prime word in uppercase
letters. Next, a blank screen appeared, creating a 200- or 1,200-ms stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA).
Finally, a lowercase target string was presented (i.e., it could either be a word or a pseudoword).
Participants had to indicate whether the target string was a word or a pseudoword.
In the SPP, pseudowords were generated by changing one or two letters from each target word to
form a pronounceable pseudoword. From these data we excluded the prime-target pairs in which the
prime or the target had three or fewer letters and those for which a limited number of datapoints were
available (i.e., 10 or less; < .0001% of the trials was excluded). This latter choice was driven by the
need of a relatively large numerosity in order to compute reliable mean accuracy and reaction times.
Following the application of this criterion, the number of stimuli eventually included as targets in our
analysis was 2,987 (1,491 words and 1,496 pseudowords), with the number of unique prime-target
pairs being 16,732 in the short-SOA condition and 16,543 in the long-SOA condition.
Distributional semantic model
The DSM used here was fastText (Joulin et al., 2016), and words and pseudowords vectors were
retrieved from the English pre-trained vectors (Grave et al., 2018). We employed fastText because of
its ability to compute semantic representations for both words and pseudowords. Indeed, fastText is
based on the idea (originally proposed by Schütze, 1993; and realized computationally by Bojanowski
et al., 2017) to take into account sub-word information by inducing semantic representations as the
sum of the vectors of the letter n-grams associated with each word. That is, fastText computes the
semantic representation of each string of letters as the sum of the vector of the full string plus all the
vectors of the 3- to 6-grams that compose it. As an example, consider the word <asking>, composed
will be the sum of the <asking> word vector along with the vectors of all the elements reported in
A similar approach can be applied to unattested strings in order to capture the semantic information
associated to pseudowords like futmaw. Of course, in this latter case the induced representation will
not consider the <futmaw> vector (since it does not exist by itself), but only on the sum of its
embedded n-grams. It should also be noted that, since fastText hashes n-grams into bins, including
the ones that were not observed in the training data, out-of-vocabulary n-grams will be mapped to a
random vector (or to the vector corresponding to another n-gram in case of a collision). Note that this
is not an issue when working with word-like pseudowords (as the ones employed here), as the overall
number of out-of-vocabulary n-grams will be very low, thus limiting representational errors.
The model was trained on Common Crawl (around 630 billion words) and Wikipedia (around 9
billion words) using the Continuous Bag of Words (CBoW) method, an approach originally proposed
by Mikolov and colleagues (2013), with 300 dimensions and a co-occurrence window of 5 words.
When using CBoW, the obtained vector dimensions capture the extent to which a target element is
reliably predicted by the linguistic contexts in which it appears, where “context” is represented as the
words contained in a fixed size window around the target word. Specifically, the CBoW model will
induce a representation for a given target w based on context words w , ..., w , w , ..., w .
0 −n −1 1 n
Using fastText, we therefore obtained semantic representations for both the words and the
pseudowords included in this analysis (i.e., the prime-target pairs). For each pair we computed a
semantic-relatedness index (SRel) based on the cosine of the angle formed by vectors representing
the meanings of the corresponding strings. The higher the SRel value, the more semantically related
the letter strings are expected to be, as estimated by the model.
Because fastText is based on very large natural language corpora and might have ended up including
some non-existent string by mistake, we systematically checked whether a “whole-pseudoword”
vector was available in the corpus for the pseudowords used in the SPP. In such cases, indeed, fastText
could learn distributional patterns about these pseudowords as if they were meaningful elements, even
if their occurrence was based on errors and typos. We found that a full vector representation was
available for 390 of the considered pseudowords. To overcome possible biases induced by the
availability of this further piece of information, we removed such whole-pseudoword vectors from
the .bin file used to retrieve the n-gram representations. For these 390 pseudowords, vectors were
computed on the basis of this updated semantic space.
Data analysis
were performed using R-Studio (RStudio Team, 2015). The plots reported were obtained using the
effects R package (Fox, 2003; Fox & Weisberg, 2019). The analyses were performed at the item-level
by computing the mean correct reaction times (RTs) and the mean accuracy for each prime-target
pair, separately for the two SOAs, in line with previous studies analyzing large databases of this kind
(e.g., Amenta et al., 2020a). Trials in which participants’ RTs were faster than 300 ms or slower than
1500 ms were removed from the computation of the mean RTs (3% of the trials excluded).
For each prime-target pair we further computed the corresponding Levenshtein distance (hence
OrthoDist), which measures the orthographic distance between two strings of symbols by quantifying
the minimum number of single-character edits (e.g., insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required
to change one element into the other (i.e., the prime into the target). The OrthoDist was computed
using the stringdist R package (Van der Loo, 2014).
For each prime and for each target, we computed their length (i.e., the number of letters in the letter
string) and, as a measure of orthographic neighborhood (hence OrthoNeigh), we computed its OLD20
(i.e., the average OrthoDist between the letter string and its 20 closer neighbors; Yarkoni et al., 2008).
In particular, the OrthoNeigh was computed using the vwr R package (Keuleers, 2013) and, to select
the possible neighbors, we considered the 15,0001 most frequent words in SUBTLEX-us (Brysbaert
& New, 2009). The inclusion of these covariates ensures that our effects are not trivially determined
by the orthographic overlap between prime and target. In fact, since fastText builds primarily on
orthographic n-grams, it might be the case that it implicitly captures the surface similarity between
words, over and above their association in terms of meaning. Evaluating the effect of OrthoDist and
OrthoNeigh allows to control for this possibility.
1 The decision to include only the 15,000 most frequent words was made i) considering the need to limit the
overestimation of the (possible) effect of low frequency words in the computation of the predictor and ii) following
Hendrix & Sun (2021), who limited the overall words used to compute the OLD20 to the 18,000 stimuli included in the
dataset they were analyzing.
Following Hendrix & Sun (2021), for each target stimulus we also computed an index labeled
semantic neighborhood (hence SNeigh). SNeigh was computed as the mean semantic similarity
between each pseudowords and its 5 closest neighbors within the 15,000 most frequent words in
SUBTLEX-US. Higher values thus indicate that a certain pseudoword is more embedded in the
semantic space. Similarly, following Hendrix and Sun (2021), for each target stimulus we also
computed an index labeled mean binomial frequency (hence MBF). MBF was computed as the
average frequency of the letter bigrams that compose each verbal stimulus. Letter bigram frequencies
were retrieved from Google Corpus Data2.
Finally, for each target we included a predictor labeled Target-related frequency. Such variable was
differently operationalized depending on the considered type of target stimulus (word vs.
pseudoword). Specifically, for word targets this predictor consists in the log-frequency of the word
as retrieved from SUBTLEX-US, while for pseudoword targets this predictor refers to the log-
frequency of its first orthographic neighbor (in terms on Levenshtein distance) within the 15,000 most
frequent words in the SUBTLEX-US.
The predictors included in our statistical models were thus: SRel, OrthoDist, Prime length, Target
length, Prime OrthoNeigh, Target OrthoNeigh, Prime frequency retrieved from the SUBTLEX-us
(Brysbaert & New, 2009), MBF, SNeigh, Target-related frequency and the type of target stimulus
(word vs. pseudoword).
To investigate the effect of SRel we estimated four linear models (LMs), separately for short and long
SOA and for RTs or accuracy as dependent variables (DVs). To obtain gaussian data distributions,
RTs were log-transformed, while for accuracy we applied the arcsine-square-root transformation
(Kruskal, 1968). The decision to log-transform RTs was driven by the fact that their distribution was
positively skewed, while accuracy was negatively skewed.
In the LMs estimated we included SRel, OrthoDist, Prime length, Target length, Prime OrthoNeigh,
Target OrthoNeigh, Prime frequency, MBF, SNeigh, and Target-related frequency as continuous
predictors, and type of target (word vs. pseudoword) as categorial predictor along with its interactions
with all the other variables. Additionally, we also included the three-way interaction SRel by Target-
related frequency by type of target (along with the relative two-way interaction SRel by Target-related
frequency). Such interaction was aiming at controlling the possible impact of pseudoword neighbors:
pseudowords included in the experiment are in fact highly similar to existing English words (since in
the SPP pseudowords were created by changing one or two letters from existing English words). If
the SRel effect is dependent on the similarity of the pseudowords with such very similar, existing
English words, the three-way interaction should be significant in the final model. Conversely, if the
three-way interaction is not significant, the eventual SRel by type of target effect would be dependent
on the specific semantic characteristics evoked by the pseudowords themselves (i.e., the distributional
pattern of their sublexical elements in natural language). In particular, the models tested was:
DV ~ (𝑆𝑅𝑒𝑙 + 𝑂𝑟𝑡ℎ𝑜𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡 + 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ + 𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ + 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑂𝑟𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑁𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ

+ 𝑆𝑅𝑒𝑙: 𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡– 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦: 𝑇𝑦𝑝𝑒
We then performed a model selection using the MuMIn R package, with the function dredge (Bartoń,
2020). This procedure selects the best fitting model (i.e., the one with the lowest Akaike information
criterion, which returns an estimation of the quality of the model, AIC; Akaike, 1973) fitting all the
possible combinations of the fixed effects included. In order to check for the consistency of the
effects, we also estimated all the models with Δ AIC < 23, as models in this AIC range can be
considered as equivalent in explaining participants’ performance (Hilbe, 2011). Here we report only
results related to the interaction of interest between SRel and type of target; for the full results
(including the effects of the other predictors) please see the Supplementary Materials.

2A). Three models had Δ AIC < 2 compared with the best model selected and reported comparable
interactions and marginal means of linear trends effects.
In particular, in the best model, the three-way interaction SRel by Target-related frequency by type
of target was not significant, F(1,16708) = 2.32, p = .12, while the interaction between SRel and type
of target was significant, F(1, 16708) = 56.27, p < .001, indicating that, for word targets, the higher
the SRel with the word prime, the lower the time needed to correctly recognize the stimulus, t(16708)
= -13.20, p < .001, b = -.08. Conversely, for pseudoword targets, the higher the SRel with the word
prime, the higher the time needed to correctly reject the stimulus, t(16708) = 2.36, p = .01, b = .04.
Notably, the same effect for pseudowords targets was present also in the three other models with Δ
AIC < 2.
Long SOA
The best model identified by the dredge selection included the effects of SRel, Target length, Target
OrthoNeigh, Prime frequency, MBF, Sneigh, Target-related frequency and their interactions with the
type of target, and, additionally, the interaction Srel by Target-related frequency, R² = .30; Adj. R² =
comparable interactions and marginal means of linear trends effects.
In particular, in the best model, the interaction between SRel and type of target was significant, F(1,
16526) = 22.21, p < .001, indicating that, for word targets, the higher the SRel with the word prime,
the lower the time needed to correctly recognize the stimulus, t(16526) = -10.54, p < .001, b = -.06.
Conversely, for the pseudoword targets, the effect of SRel was not significant, t(16526) = .28, p =
.78, b = .005 (nor it was in the other eight models tested with Δ AIC < 2).
Accuracy
Short SOA
The best model identified by the dredge selection included all the predictors and interactions tested
with the exception of the three-way interaction SRel by Target-related frequency by type of target,
selected and reported comparable interactions and marginal means of linear trends effects.
In particular, in the best model, the interaction between SRel and type of target was significant, F(1,
16709) = 38.35, p < .001, indicating that, for word targets, the higher the SRel with the word prime,
the higher the accuracy, t(16709) = 5.26, p < .001, b = .06. Conversely, for the pseudoword targets,
the higher the SRel with the word prime, the lower the accuracy, t(16709) = -2.86, p = .004, b = -.10.
Notably, the same effect for pseudoword targets was present also in the nineteen other models with
Δ AIC < 2.
Long SOA
The best model identified by the dredge selection included the effects of SRel, Target length, Target
OrthoNeigh, Prime frequency, MBF, SNeigh, Target-related frequency and their interactions with the
model selected and reported comparable interactions effects, while for marginal means of linear
trends effects, they were consistent across target words, but not fully consistent across target
pseudowords.
In particular, in the best model, the interaction between SRel and type of target was significant, F(1,
16527) = 32.80, p < .001, indicating that, for word targets, the higher the SRel with the word prime,
the higher the accuracy, t(16527) = 7.53, p < .001, b = .07. Conversely, for the pseudoword targets,
the higher the SRel with the word prime, the lower the accuracy, t(16527) = -2.05, p = .04, b = -.07.
Note that this latter effect for pseudoword targets was not significant in two of the other five models
with Δ AIC < 2.
Discussion of Experiment 1
In Experiment 1 we analyzed data from the SPP (Hutchinson et al., 2013) and found results consistent
with the idea that the processing of words and pseudowords can influence each-other at the semantic
level. In particular, at a short SOA (i.e., 200 ms) the time needed to judge whether a target was a
pseudoword increased as a function of the semantic relatedness with the prime word, while the
accuracy decreased, indicating in turn that the decision was more difficult the more the prime word
was semantically related to the pseudoword target. Hence, the meaning activated by the prime word
interfered with the semantics activated by the pseudoword, suggesting that this interference occurred
via shared semantic information. At a long SOA (i.e., 1200 ms) no SRel effect was found for
pseudowords on RTs, while for accuracy results were not fully consistent across all the models
estimated. These results may indicate that the semantic effect for pseudowords may be the result of
automatic processes operating at shorter SOAs, while the effect may disappear at longer SOAs when
controlled processing strategies become activated (e.g., Küper & Heil, 2009). This is consistent with
previous studies showing that weaker effects in semantic priming might be associated with faster
activation decay, and hence are less likely to be observed in long-SOA paradigms (e.g., Petilli et a.,
2021).
Yet, the pseudowords included in the SPP were not selected ad hoc for our aims and may contain key
linguistic units trivially known to carry meaning. Indeed, the morphological characteristics of the
strings of letters composing a pseudoword, such as particular linguistic regularities like suffixes (e.g.,
in English words ending in -acy are indicative of a state or a quality, such as in the words privacy,
fallacy or delicacy), are informative of meaning and were shown to affect processing (e.g., Amenta,
et al., 2020b; Marelli & Baroni, 2015; Ulicheva et al., 2021). As a consequence, the observed semantic
effect could have been driven by these linguistically defined meaning-carrying sublexical elements,
and not by a broader, more general, sub-word semantic effect. Additionally, SPP pseudowords were
obtained by changing one or two letters of a real English word (e.g., abnolmal, alnohol, belax) and
were hence highly similar to existing words; the observed semantic effect could have therefore been
driven by some sort of turple effect (e.g., Forster & Hector, 2002) captured by the structure of
fastText. Even if this is unlikely considering the lack of a significant three-way interaction between
SRel, target type and Target-related frequency, a tighter control of these potential influences would
be desirable. On these grounds, we opted to perform an independent replication in a different language
(i.e., Italian), by taking into account these potential confoundings. In particular, in Experiment 2, we
built a new set of pseudowords excluding items i) that included suffixes and ii) selecting a priori
word-pseudoword pairs across a wider semantic-relatedness distribution.
Experiment 2
Methods
Participants
Seventy-five students participated in this experiment for course credits (22 males, M age = 23.36
years, SD = 2.91). We recruited as many students as possible before the end of the semester. All
participants were native Italian speakers, had normal or corrected to normal vision and were naïve to
the purpose of the study. Informed consent was obtained from all participants before the experiment.
The protocol was approved by the psychological ethical committee of the University of Pavia and
participants were treated in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Distributional semantic model
As in the analysis of the data from the SPP, we employed fastText (Joulin et al., 2016). The only
difference is that in this case we considered the Italian word vectors (Grave, et al., 2018). The model
was trained on Common Crawl and Italian Wikipedia (around 11 billion words) using CBOW with
300 dimensions, character n-grams of up to length 5, and a window of size 5.
As for Experiment 1, we checked whether a full vector was available in the corpus for the
pseudowords used. We found that for 12 pseudowords such a representation was available. Thus, to
overcome possible effects related to these whole-pseudoword vector, we removed them from the .bin
file used to compute the pseudoword representations. For these 12 pseudowords, the vectors were
thus based on this updated semantic space.
Stimuli
Stimuli were prepared starting from the words included in the Italian ANEW database (Montefinese
et al., 2014). In the study by Montefinese and colleagues, a large number of participants were asked
to rate Italian words on different scales, including concreteness (ranging from 1, abstract, to 9,
concrete).
First, from the ANEW database, we selected the 400 most concrete words: this was aimed at reducing
the variability between the included stimuli, since concrete words are generally understood more
easily compared with abstract ones (e.g., Kounios & Holcomb, 1994; for a similar approach, in which
concrete words were used in a semantic priming task, see: Günther et al., 2016). Then, using Wuggy
(Keuleers, & Brysbaert, 2010), we automatically obtained 3570 pseudowords. Wuggy was set using
its standard parameters, that is: orthographic Italian module, restricted match length of subsyllabic
segments, restricted match letter length, restricted match transition frequencies, match segments 2
out of 3. Starting from a given word, Wuggy allows for the generation of written polysyllabic
pseudowords that obey a given language’s phonotactic constraints and that match its template in
subsyllabic structure. That is, Wuggy generates highly word-like pseudowords but also stimuli that
are not easily identifiable as related to existing words.
Subsequently, using fastText, we induced vector representations for each of the 400 words selected
from the ANEW database and for the obtained pseudowords. We thus paired each word with each
pseudoword, and words with each other, obtaining 1,428,000 word-pseudoword pairs and 159,600
word-word pairs, and computed a semantic-relatedness index (SRel) for each pair as in Experiment
1. Then, word-pseudoword and word-word pairs were included as prime-target stimuli based on the
following criteria: i) pseudowords had to be orthotactically legal for Italian; ii) pseudowords had not
to include recognizable suffixes4 (e.g., the words that ended with -aio, -iato, -ista, etc.5 were not
included); iii) to allow for an uniform-like distribution of SRel values (applied to both word-word
and word-pseudoword pairs; with SRel ranging from .007 to.49) we included a similar amount of
pairs for each .1 step of SRel (see the Supplementary Materials for the graphical distributions).
Additionally, each letter string (being either a word or a pseudoword) had to appear maximum one
time in the whole set of stimuli. These criteria guarantee that potential effects are not driven by
semantic information carried by morphological cues (Marelli & Baroni, 2015), and depend only on
the semantic impact of sub-lexical, non linguistically-defined, chunks.
The final set of stimuli included 180 pairs (90 word-word pairs and 90 word-pseudowords pairs).
Procedure
Participants were shown two letter strings, presented sequentially one after the other, and were asked
to judge whether the latter stimulus was an Italian word or not. The former word was presented in
uppercase letters (see: Hutchison et al., 2013) and participants were required to respond only to the
latter (presented in lowercase letters), as fast and as accurately as possible by pressing the A or L key
using the left or right index fingers, respectively; the response keys were counterbalanced across
participants. The trials were presented in random order.
Hence, Experiment 2 was identical with the task employed in the SPP except for two methodological
details. Firstly, here participants were tested using PsychoPy (Peirce et al., 2019) through the online
each trial started with a central fixation cross (presented for 500 ms) and was followed by a first word
(the prime, presented for 500 ms), by a brief interval (100 ms) and then by a second stimulus (the
target word or pseudoword, presented for 3000 ms). Participants’ response ended the trial and moved
to a blank screen (presented for 1000 ms), which preceded the fixation cross of the next trial.
4 We discarded potential pseudowords based on suffixes only. The decision to consider only suffixes and not also
prefixes was driven by the fact that it would have been extremely complex to exclude pseudowords based also on all the
a- (indicative of negation) would have automatically excluded all the pseudowords beginning with a- (and a large
number of Italian words start with a- but are not indicative of negation). However, note that no pseudoword having
evident prefix-like onsets (e.g., anti-, contro-, extra-) was included in our set of stimuli.
Data analysis
The statistical analyses were performed using R-Studio (RStudio Team, 2015) and the lme4 R package
(Bates et al., 2015). Plots reported were obtained using the effects R package (Fox, 2003; Fox &
Weisberg, 2019).
The dependent variables were accuracy (i.e., “incorrect” responses were scored as 0s, whereas
“correct” responses as 1s) and log-transformed correct reaction times (RTs). Trials in which
participants’ RTs were faster than 300 ms or slower than 1,500 ms were removed from the analysis
(3% of the trials excluded).
As in Experiment 1, for each prime-target pair we computed the OrthoDist using the stringdist R
package (Van der Loo, 2014). For each prime and target, we also computed its length, OrthoNeigh
with the vwr R package (Keuleers, 2013), and, for each target, SNeigh. In this case, we used the
was computed for each target. Letter bigram frequencies were retrieved from ItWaC Data6. Finally,
as for Experiment 1, for each target we included the Target-related frequency predictor, this time
computed using SUBTLEX-IT.
The predictors in our statistical models were identical to those included in Experiment 1. To
investigate if the SRel between the prime word and the target could affect RTs, we ran a Linear Mixed
Model (LMM) having RTs as dependent variable, while to probe whether there was an effect on
accuracy, we ran a generalized LMM (GLMM).
In the GLMM we set the number of adaptive Gauss–Hermite quadrature points to zero (i.e., setting
nAGQ = 0, see: Bates et al. 2015) for computational efficiency reasons7. In both models, participants
and prime-target pairs were included as random intercepts. In both models, the fixed effects estimated
were identical to Experiment 1. In particular, in the lme4 syntax, the models tested were:
DV ~ (𝑆𝑅𝑒𝑙 + 𝑂𝑟𝑡ℎ𝑜𝐷𝑖𝑠𝑡 + 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ + 𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ + 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑂𝑟𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑁𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ
+ 𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 𝑂𝑟𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑁𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ + 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 + 𝑀𝐵𝐹 + 𝑆𝑁𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ
+ 𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡– 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦) × 𝑇𝑦𝑝𝑒 + 𝑆𝑅𝑒𝑙: 𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡– 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦
+ 𝑆𝑅𝑒𝑙: 𝑇𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡– 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦: 𝑇𝑦𝑝𝑒 + (1|𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑡) + (1|𝐼𝑡𝑒𝑚)
7 This procedure allows for a relatively fast estimation of the models, but it is less optimized compared with other
methods. We opted for this procedure as other optimizers would have been extremely time-consuming. Additionally,
control analyses testing the best models with both nAGQ = 0 and nAGQ = 1 showed that the Δ AICs were overall
similar.
For both models we performed a model selection using the MuMIn R package (Bartoń, 2020), in
analogy with the analyses on the SPP data. In order to check for the consistency of the effects, we
also estimated all the models with Δ AIC < 28.
Finally, to exclude the impact of overly influential outliers, after having fitted the best model
identified by the dredge selection on RTs, data points were removed on the basis of a threshold of
2.5 SD standardized residual errors (model criticism; Baayen, 2008). Results based on the refitted
models are reported. Here we report only results related to the interaction SRel by type of target, for
the full results (including the effects of the other predictors) please see the Supplementary Materials.
Results
Descriptive statistics
from very low, as the one between SRel and MBF (r = .03), to high, as the one between prime length
and prime OrthoNeigh (r = .90).
Reaction times
The best model identified by the dredge selection included SRel, Target-related frequency and their
interaction with type of target and, additively, Prime OrthoNeigh, Pseudo-R² (total) = .49; Pseudo-R²
(fixed effects) = .13. No other model had Δ AIC < 2 compared with the best model selected.
The interaction between SRel and type of target was significant, F(1,170) = 16.98, p < .001, indicating
4A). That is, for the word targets, the higher the SRel, the faster the RTs, z = -3.24, p < .001, b = -
.12; while for the pseudoword targets, the higher the SRel, the slower the RTs, z = 2.61, p = .009, b
= .10.
Accuracy
The best model included SRel, Target length, Target OrthoNeigh, Target-related frequency and their
interaction with the type of target and, additively, Prime OrthoNeigh, Pseudo-R² (total) = .34; Pseudo-
R² (fixed effects) = .08. Twenty-one models had Δ AIC < 2 compared with the best model selected.
The interaction SRel by type of pair was included in sixteen over twenty-two models and it was
significant in twelve (with the effect of SRel on pseudowords being significant in eleven of them).
In particular, in the best model, the interaction SRel by type of pair was significant, χ2(1) = 4.34, p =
.03, indicating that the effect of SRel differentially predicted participants’ accuracy across the two
types of targets. For pseudowords the higher the SRel, the lower the accuracy, z = -2.08, p = .03, b =
this effect being likely caused by ceiling effects (i.e., participants’ accuracy for words was overall
very high).
Discussion of Experiment 2
In Experiment 2 we replicated the semantic-priming effect on pseudowords (and, specifically, the
effect observed at the shortest SOA in Experiment 1) for both reaction times and accuracy. In
particular, reaction times increased for increasing semantic relatedness between word primes and
pseudoword targets. Consistent effects were observed here also for accuracy, with increasing
semantic relatedness associated with a higher number of errors (i.e., pseudoword targets were
incorrectly identified as words), despite in this case the pattern was less consistent as it was not
present in all the models estimated. This testifies a pervasive influence of the semantic association
between prime and target stimuli on the overall performance, regardless of whether these stimuli
where part of the familiar lexicon or not.
Notably, these effects were observed although we controlled for various confounding variables (e.g.,
excluding pseudowords with Italian suffixes). As a consequence, the observed semantic effects are
to be understood in terms of a general form-meaning systematicity occurring at the sub-word level.
That is, the presentation of a prime word activates a pattern of meaning in participants’ semantic
memory; when this pattern overlaps with the one elicited by the sublexical information of the target
pseudoword, participants’ performance is affected, increasing the response for this latter.
General Discussion
In the present study, we probed for the first time whether the same associative mechanisms governing
word meaning also subserve the processing of pseudowords. We took advantage of a distributional
semantic model, namely fastText (Bojanowski et al., 2017), able to approximate the semantic
information carried by sub-word units in language and explored whether this information can predict
participants’ performance in a typical priming task. In Experiment 1, we first analyzed the data of the
semantic priming project (Hutchison et al., 2013), while in Experiment 2 we ran an independent
replication on a different language, controlling for a series of potential confounding variables. Results
were consistent across the two experiments and showed that at increasing semantic relatedness
between prime word and target pseudoword (i.e., the more the corresponding orthographic elements
elicited an overlapping semantic pattern) participants’ reaction times increased, while accuracy
decreased (although the pattern for accuracy was less consistent). Notably, as we used a lexical
decision task, participants were not explicitly asked to link the information carried by pseudowords
with aspects of meaning. That is, we could directly probe whether the (semantic) activation elicited
by the prime word would automatically interfere with pseudoword processing, with no need to
encourage a semantic interpretation of the unfamiliar string. This suggests that, when encountering
any (well-formed) linguistic string, a speaker will routinely activate information in semantic memory,
irrespective of the lexicality of the stimulus. Such information would tap into the same system storing
the meanings of actual words, leading to the possibility of semantic priming effects between word
and pseudowords. This speaks for a natural inclination, in human beings, to make sense of their
experience, even when this latter is, at face value, meaningless: when the whole string does not have
an explicit link with a meaning stored in semantic memory, humans can still rely on the distribution
of sub-word elements in linguistic contexts to derive a semantic intuition. This interpretation can be
seen as the linguistic counterpart of well-known visual illusory effects such as pareidolia and
apophenia (i.e., the tendency of identifying meaningful patterns where none truly exist, as when
people tend to see faces from objects or meaningless visual patterns), with all these phenomena
possibly tapping on a common substrate of human’s tendency to search for a meaning in complex
and fuzzy environments.
These findings well complement non-arbitrary perspectives on language processing (Dingemanse et
al., 2015). The semantic effect found for pseudowords can indeed be explained with reference to the
humans’ tendency to detect systematic and statistical regularities in the (language) environment
(Romberg & Saffran, 2010; Vidal et al., 2021), here expressed in the form of nuanced distributional
patterns of sub-word information. Accordingly, seminal studies have shown that children can extract
syllabic patterns based on transitional probabilities between elements, when these patterns are
presented in a continuous stream (Saffran et al., 1996). Subsequent studies have demonstrated that
humans extensively exploit these experienced-based learning mechanisms in grammatical,
phonological, and orthographical processing (e.g., Adriaans, & Kager, 2010; Altmann, et al., 1995;
Saffran & Wilson, 2003; Thompson & Newport, 2007; and for a review: Bogaerts et al., 2021;
Christiansen, 2019), and similar effects have been reported also at for semantic processing (e.g.,
Ulicheva et al., 2020). Integrating this evidence, our findings indicate that humans could exploit form-
to-meaning regularities at a deeper level (i.e., in term of distributional patterns of sub-word
information), with these processes possibly being far more extensive than previously thought (for
recent evidence see: Chuang et al., 2021). Specifically, these findings support seminal connectionist
theories (e.g., Harm & Seidenberg, 1999; Plaut & Gonnerman, 2000; Seidenberg & Gonnerman,
2000) as well as more recent perspectives (Baayen et al., 2011), which map form onto meaning
relying on the parallel nature of neural processing, and the distributed nature of neural representations.
Accordingly, units in language would primarily depend on the way they are acquired, organized and
used by humans (Marelli et al., 2020).
Additionally, the present findings on pseudowords processing constitute a serious challenge to
classical theories on priming tasks. Seminal accounts explained participants’ performance in the
semantic priming task by maintaining that the processing of the first word automatically pre-activates
its semantic neighbors (i.e., the semantic activation of the prime spreads through its neighborhood in
a network in which each word is a unit): hence, the semantically closer the prime and the target words
in the semantic network, the faster the judgement about the target (Collins & Loftus, 1975). Following
these accounts, a performance impairment when judging pseudowords induced by their semantic
relationship with a prime word would be simply inconceivable, since pseudowords would not have
any place in such symbolic semantic network. Contrarily to these views, our results show that such
semantic effects are possible, suggesting that distributional models of semantic memory could be
more well-fitted to explain the structure of human semantic memory as compared to network-based
models (Günther et al., 2019).
Interestingly, several studies have shown facilitatory effects of iconicity and systematicity on word
acquisition (e.g., Cassani & Limacher, 2021; Imai et al., 2015; Monaghan et al., 2012). These pieces
of evidence suggest that, in vocabulary expansion, the ease of attaching a meaning to the newly
acquired label plays a substantial role, and hence that the semantic system provides an important
contribution to such process. The present results expand and further support these conclusions, by
showing that, even in a context in which there is no new word to be acquired, processing unfamiliar
strings implies the activation of semantic information that is entangled with familiar words. In fact,
pseudowords in our lexical decision task are not characterized as meaning-bearing units that are
(potentially) part of the lexicon, as new words during acquisition are assumed to be; on the contrary,
they are defined in the very experiment instructions as non-existing terms, that must be identified as
such by the participants. Nevertheless, they are shown to be affected by the very semantic information
activated by the lexical prime, speaking for how pervasive and automatic the meaning-extraction
process is, even in front of a string of symbols that has been clearly framed as not being part of the
lexicon of a language, and providing new evidence in favor of the role of systematicity in word
processing.
Given that this evidence was crucially obtained by relying on model building on linguistic
distributions, the present results are in line with the idea that human semantic memory has developed
by exploiting and re-cycling general-purpose associative learning mechanisms (Günther et al., 2019),
with increasing evidence showing that reward prediction error principles are at play in the formation
of declarative memory traces (Ergo et al., 2020). Specifically, these processes seem to apply to low-
level, featural elements in the environment, in the present case by keeping track and ultimately
quantifying the learning history of sub-word units in language. The distributional pattern of sub-word
information would be then combined when elaborating more complex elements (i.e., words or
pseudowords), with such combination representing a meaningful cue built on a linguistic experiential
basis. The evidence presented here provides direct support to such a distributed model of human
semantic memory, in that each word would activate a representation based on the distributional
pattern of its sub-units. Notably, these domain-general processes would be employed for any
linguistic stimulus and, consequently, also for new words, which would end up being represented by
the very same memory system. The involvement of these flexible cognitive processes is ideal
considering that semantic memory (and language more generally) is a generative system, that must
deal with novel information almost on a daily basis. Indeed, an adult speaker learn from 1.7 (Nation,
2006) to 11 (Nagy & Anderson, 1984) new words per day (for a complete discussion see: Brysbaert
and colleagues, 2016).
In conclusion, using distributional semantic models we provide evidence for a semantic priming
effect on pseudowords, demonstrating that semantic induction from words vis-à-vis pseudowords can
be traced back to domain-general associative mechanisms operating over the same memory system.
Our findings directly support theories on the non-arbitrariness of language and provide novel insights
on the distributed structure of human semantic memory.
