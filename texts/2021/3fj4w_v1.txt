Abstract
Biological factors including genetic variation are contributors to differences in moral decisions.
Recently, Gong et al. (2017) reported that female carriers of more shorter alleles of the func-
tional (CAG) polymorphism in the androgen receptor (AR) gene showed enhanced endorse-
ment of harmful actions. We aimed to replicate and extend these findings. N = 155 healthy
young adults of Western European/German origin were genotyped for the AR (CAG) polymor-
phism and completed a set of moral dilemmas that are designed to allow an estimation of un-
derlying utilitarian and deontological tendencies in addition to the traditional moral score.
While AR (CAG) genotype did not affect moral judgement in men, there were (CAG) × en-
n n
docrine status interactions in the female sample, particularly on deontology. Women using oral
contraceptives who carried two short (CAG) alleles had reduced levels of deontology com-
pared to carriers of long (CAG) alleles. Descriptively, the opposite pattern emerged for free
cycling women. The findings underscore the importance of androgenic function for moral
judgement and highlight the modulatory role of exogenous steroids.
Key words: moral judgement, deontology, utilitarianism, androgen receptor gene, CAG repeat
polymorphism; combined oral contraceptives

1 Introduction
There is an ongoing research effort to investigate correlates and potential causes of differences
in moral sentiments and judgements. One growing area of research focusses on biological fac-
tors (Reese et al., 2020) including genetic variation (Smith & Hatemi, 2020). Recently, Gong
et al. (2017) reported in a sample of Han Chinese an effect of the trinucleotide (CAG) repeat
polymorphism in exon 1 of the androgen receptor (AR) gene on the permissibility of harmful
actions in women but not in men. Located on chromosome Xq11.2, AR expression is in part
modulated by the (CAG) polymorphism (Takeyama et al., 2002). Less repeats, i.e., shorter (S)
alleles, are associated with increased transcription and enhanced receptor sensitivity towards
testosterone compared to longer (L) alleles (Irvine et al., 2000). Testosterone, in turn, is a mod-
ulator of moral decision-making and has additionally been linked to intermediate variables un-
derlying moral judgements, e.g., empathy (e.g., Nitschke & Bartz, 2020), psychopathy (review:
Yildirim & Derksen, 2012), and risk affinity (review: Kurath & Mata, 2018). Testosterone has
been associated—although inconsistently—with enhanced endorsement of harmful actions
serving the greater good (e.g., Carney & Mason, 2010). Correspondingly, Gong et al. (2017)
reported increased permissibility ratings of harmful actions in women with more copies of AR
(CAG) S alleles, i.e., genotypes which result in increased AR sensitivity.
Gong et al. (2017) pointed out that their results might be either due to an enhanced (utilitarian)
bias towards overall beneficial outcomes, a reduced aversion to inflict harm (i.e., a disregard
for deontological principles), or both. One way to solve this issue is the use of a process disso-
ciation (PD) approach as has been suggested by Conway and Gawronski (2013). Briefly, the
approach is based on parallel congruent and incongruent versions of moral dilemmas. Incon-
gruent dilemmas pit deontological and utilitarian principles against each other by proposing
harmful actions, which are offset by outcomes outweighing concurrent harm and maximize the
Preprint
greater good. Contrariwise, in congruent dilemmas the harm inflicted is not outweighed by the
outcome. Thus, the PD approach disentangles deontological and utilitarian inclinations under-
lying moral decisions (Conway & Gawronski, 2013) and can help to elucidate the reasons for
an increased acceptance of harmful actions as observed in female carriers of AR (CAG) S
alleles (Gong et al., 2017).
We used German versions of the dilemma set of Conway & Gawronski (2013) and aimed to (1)
replicate the findings of Gong et al. (2017) in a European sample and to (2) extend them by
investigating whether potential differences in moral judgements are due to variations in under-
lying utilitarianism, deontology, or both (cf. Conway & Gawronski, 2013). Since there is evi-
dence that combined oral contraceptives (COC) modulate social cognition (Montoya & Bos,
2017), we included endocrine status (men vs. free cycling women vs. women using COC) in
our analyses.
2 Materials and Methods
We report how we determined our sample size (see supplement), all data exclusions, all manip-
ulations, and all measures in the study (Simmons et al., 2012). All materials, data, and analyses
2.1 Participants
We recruited 158 participants at the Technische Universität Dresden. Due to technical prob-
lems, one session had to be aborted prematurely leaving 157 young adults of Western Euro-
pean/German origin (men: n = 71, 25.31 ± 4.30 years; women: n = 86, 23.31 ± 3.35 years). Free
Preprint
cycling female participants took part during the early follicular or late luteal phase while COC
users participated during active pill use (see supplement for further details).
2.2 Procedure
A detailed description of the study protocol can be found in the supplement. Briefly, after a 5-
minutes resting period, during which electro-cardiographic and electro-dermal activity was as-
sessed (data not reported here), participants completed a German version of the moral dilemma
paradigm (cf. Conway & Gawronski, 2013) followed by personality questionnaires and the col-
lection of saliva samples for later genotyping. The study was approved by the ethics committee
of the Technische Universität Dresden (EK 225052019).
2.3 Genotyping
Genotyping for the AR (CAG) polymorphism followed the protocol used by Gong et al. (2017)
as did S (≤ 22 repeats) and L (> 22 repeats) allele designations. In the female sample, genotype
distribution was as follows: LL n = 12 (14%), SL n = 46 (53.5%), SS n = 28 (32.5%). In the
male sample, n = 26 (37.7%) carried the L allele and n = 43 (62.3%) the S allele. Genotyping
was unsuccessful in two men. Information on allele distributions are included in the supple-
ment.
3.4 Statistical Analyses
We conducted an ANOVA with AR (CAG) genotype and endocrine status as between-subjects
factors. Outcome variables were moral judgement parameters, i.e., (1) the proportion of deci-
sions for outcome-based options in incongruent dilemmas (= traditional score), (2) estimated
Preprint
utilitarianism, and (3) estimated deontology (cf. Conway & Gawronski, 2013). Ancillary anal-
yses were performed to investigate potential effects of AR (CAG) genotype and endocrine sta-
tus on response times and perceived difficulty in making moral decisions.
3 Results
Analysis in the total sample found no main effect of the AR (CAG) polymorphism on the tra-
ditional moral dilemma score (F = 0.58, p = .449 𝜂 = 0.004), utilitarianism (F = 0.18,

a descriptive level, the opposite pattern emerged in free cycling women, although none of the
effects reached significance (all p ≥ .299). Furthermore, there was no effect of the AR (CAG)
polymorphism in the male sample on any of the three moral judgement parameters (all p ≥
.913).
Ancillary analyses of response times and difficulty ratings found no main effect of AR (CAG)
(p = .967 and p = .196). There were also no interactions between genotype and endocrine status
(p = .334 and p = .119) or between genotype and dilemma type (congruent vs. incongruent; p
= .584 and p = .234). However, while the three-way interaction between (CAG) × endocrine
status × dilemma type did not reach significance for response times (p = .067), it was significant
for difficulty ratings (F = 4.49, p = .013, 𝜂 = 0.057). The effect was limited to incongruent

between AR (CAG) genotypes (p = .415).

4 Discussion
Similar to Gong et al. (2017) we found no effect of the functional AR (CAG) polymorphism
on moral judgement in men. However, in women there was an interaction effect between endo-
crine status and AR (CAG) on deontology and the traditional moral dilemma score, i.e., the
proportion of outcome-based decisions that endorse harmful actions for the ‘greater good’.
COC users with two (CAG) S alleles were more likely to opt for harmful choices that were
nevertheless overall beneficial compared to L allele carriers. Analysis of underlying tendencies
revealed that this was due to decreased deontological inclinations while there was no difference
in utilitarianism between the genetic groups. On a descriptive level, the opposite was observed
in free cycling women. In extension to Gong et al. (2017), our results indicate that while AR
(CAG) genotype in interaction with endocrine status modulated the predisposition towards
deontological rules (e.g., do no harm), consideration of the overall outcome and greater benefit
(i.e., utilitarian tendencies) was unaffected. In addition, AR (CAG) genotype and endocrine
status also affected difficulty ratings in incongruent dilemmas in women. In free cycling
women, carriers of (CAG) L alleles reported less difficulty in making moral decisions com-
pared to SS genotypes, while the opposite tendency was found in COC users. Thus, groups with
reduced deontological inclinations also tended to report less difficulty in making moral deci-
sions.
Although oral contraceptives are available in more than 40 different formulations (cf. Taylor et
al., 2020), one general effect is the reduction of endogenous estrogens and progesterone while
maintaining high levels of their synthetic counterparts (Burkman et al., 2011). So far, interac-
tion effects of high exogenous and low endogenous steroid levels on downstream physiological
and psychological processes are not exactly clear (Lewis et al., 2019). Furthermore, while en-
dogenous androgen levels (e.g., testosterone) decrease in COC users as well, androgen receptor
Preprint
signaling can be affected in various ways since synthetic progestogens also bind to the AR—
with differing affinity (Burkman et al., 2011). Depending on progestin type, potential effects
range from strongly androgenic to strongly anti-androgenic (Taylor et al., 2020). Thus, in ad-
dition to genetic variations, AR signaling in COC users also depends on COC formulation,
which might partly explain the diverging findings in free cycling women vs. COC users.
There are several differences between our study and the study by Gong et al. (2017). We used
a different dilemma set which allowed the investigation of underlying moral inclinations by
using a PD approach (cf. Conway & Gawronski, 2013). Nevertheless, dilemma content features
differed and might have contributed to the results. Furthermore, there are ethnic and cultural
differences. While the sample of Gong et al. (2017) consisted of Han Chinese, our participants
were of Western European/German origin. Our sample was also significantly older (24.2 ± 3.9
years vs. 20.4 ± 1.2 years, t = 18.17, p ≤ .001, Hedges’ g = 1.69). Limitations of our study
include a rather small sample size and a predominantly student sample. Despite these differ-
ences and limitations, our findings provide further evidence that AR (CAG) genotype and oral
contraceptive use are associated with differences in moral judgement in women.
