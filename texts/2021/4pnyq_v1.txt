23 Abstract
25 We conducted an online study featuring two experiments in order to examine the relationship between
26 depersonalization experiences (DP) (i.e. feelings of being detached from one’s self and body) and
27 vicarious affective touch and self-touch. Experiment 1 examined to what extent DP traits modulate the
28 perceived pleasantness and/or vividness of tactile experiences as imagined being received by the self
29 and other. In experiment 2 we designed a new affective self-touch intervention in order to explore the
30 effect of CT-optimal self-touch stroking on one’s dorsal forearm on the perceived pleasantness and
31 vividness of tactile experiences as being received by the self and other. We found that low DP
32 individuals reported higher perceived pleasantness and vividness rating for touch. By contrast, the
33 high DP cohort rated all touch experiences as significantly less pleasant. No significant interaction
34 effects for vividness ratings of touch experiences across low and high DP. In addition, our results
35 suggest that people with low DP rate the perceived pleasantness of the imagined social touch
36 experiences as received by the self higher than if received by the other. Interestingly, in high DP
37 individuals, there is no difference in the perceived pleasantness of affective touch imagined as being
38 received by the self vs the other. Finally, we found that both low and high DP participants, following
39 our tailored CT-optimal affective self-touch intervention on one’s own body, report significantly
40 higher ratings of vividness of tactile perception.

1. Introduction
54 The sense of self, the subjective feeling of being an ‘I’ or a ‘self’ bound to my body as
55 distinct from the world and others, is a fundamental aspect of our everyday experiences
56 (Gallagher 2000; Damasio 2000; Zahavi 2005; Blanke & Metzinger 2009; see Quin et al.
57 2020 for a review).
59 Depersonalisation (DP) is a common dissociative experience characterized by distressing
60 feelings of being detached or estranged from one’s self and body. It can also combine with
61 similar feelings of detachment from one’s surroundings (DR Derealisation) (Sierra & Berrios
62 1997). As a person with DP explains: “when I’m having an episode of depersonalisation, it
63 feels more like I’m watching myself doing things, but I’m not present for it. I’m witnessing
64 myself… I ‘know’ I’m in control, but I’m not ‘feeling’ in control” (Perkins 2021:44). This
65 self-detachment induces uncanny sensations of not being fully present or real, and of losing
66 touch with one’s self, body and the world (Simeon & Abugel, 2006; Sierra 2009; Ciaunica &
67 Charlton, 2018).
69 DP is often triggered by traumatic life events, substance use, severe stress, prolonged
70 depression, extreme fatigue (van Heugten et al. 2015; Titubos et al. 2018). DP has a
71 prevalence of around 1-2% of the population, with an onset in adolescence or early adulthood
72 (Baker et al. 2003; Hunter et al. 2003,2004; Michal et al. 2007; see Salami et al. 2020 for a
73 recent review). Chronic states of depersonalisation and derealisation symptoms may lead to a
74 diagnosis of Depersonalisation-Derealisation Disorder (DDD) (American Psychiatric
75 Association 2013). The classification of DP and DDD as dissociative conditions is subject to
76 a nuanced approach. Millman and colleagues (2021) recently used a latent profile analysis to
77 examine symptom variability in clinical depersonalisation. They analysis identified two
78 qualitatively different categories of dissociative symptoms: “compartmentalization” and
79 “detachment “(Brown, 2006; Holmes et al. 2005). Detachment is defined as the subjective
80 sense of separation typically encountered in DP, whereas compartmentalization refers to a
81 dissociative inability to have deliberate control over actions. In this paper we are concerned
82 with transient and mild experiences of DP as self-detachment.
85 The experience of a disconnect between the self and the body—strikingly described as feeling
86 trapped in one’s head (mind) and outside one’s body (Ciaunica et al. 2020)—is one of the
87 most frequently cited symptoms in DP (Sierra & David, 2011). Sierra (2009) lists four
88 prominent types of anomalous body experiences in DP: (1) lack of body ownership (2)
89 feelings of loss of agency (3) disembodiment feelings and (4) somatosensory distortions.
90 Empirical support for this disrupted bodily sensory processing comes from studies that
91 demonstrate disrupted physiological responses in patients with DDD, compared to healthy
92 participants (Dewe et al., 2018; Owens et al., 2015; Sierra et al., 2002). DP has also been
93 linked to disrupted activity in neuronal regions underlying somatic processing (Lemche, et al.,
94 2013; Medford et al., 2016) and the vestibular system (Jáuregui Renaud, 2015), which is
95 responsible for providing information about the body’s position in space (Ferrè & Haggard,
96 2016).
99 Importantly, people experiencing DP report a significant impact of this self-detachment on the
100 quality of their social and emotional life, leading to social isolation: “Feeling unreal and
101 disconnected from my body and the world around me caused me to lose interest in the people
102 and hobbies I used to love” (Perkins 2021: 190).
104 Recent work has emphasised the multisensory and embodied basis of the human sense of self
105 and self-consciousness as it unfolds dynamically throughout the lifespan (Alais et al. 2010;
106 Deroy et al. 2014; Faivre et al. 2017; Tsakiris 2017; Ciaunica et al. 2021a,b). Among the
107 senses, tactile perception and particularly self-touch has recently received close attention
108 (Gallace & Spence 2010; Ratcliffe 2013, Ciaunica & Fotopoulou 2017; Boehme & Olausson
109 2021). The key idea is that tactile perception is inherently relational and reciprocal: the
110 ‘toucher’ and the ‘touched’ need to be physically proximal, to ‘share’ the experience of touch
111 (passive or active) (Merleau-Ponty 1962).
113 While traditionally self-awareness is considered to emerge through visuospatial and distal
114 mirror self-recognition (Lewis et al. 1989), recent work outlined that humans first
115 perceptually ‘meet’ other people’s bodies (via proximal skin-to-skin interactions) (Ciaunica
116 2017). Indeed, touch is one of the first of our senses to develop in the human embryo
117 (Gottlieb 1976), and provides us thereby with our most basic and earliest means of perceiving
118 both the self and the social and physical environment, already in utero (Ciaunica et al.
119 2021a,d). Hence it has been hypothesised that touch perception might represent a fundamental
120 step in the development of both self- and other-awareness, as well as self-other distinction
121 (Rochat & Striano 2000; McGlone et al. 2014; Ciaunica & Fotopoulou, 2017; Ciaunica &
122 Crucianelli 2019). People are also more likely turn to touch for subjective reassurance, when
123 their sense of reality is shaken (Fairhurst et al 2018; Fairhurst & Deroy 2019).
125 The pivotal role of touch for the bodily self has received further attention especially after the
126 discovery that gentle, caress-like stroking on the hairy skin at an optimal velocity (3-10m/s,
127 Löken et al., 2009) and skin temperature (Ackerley et al. 2014) activates a specific subclass of
128 receptors. The so-called C-tactile (CT) afferents in human hairy skin code for pleasant touch,
129 (Johansson et al. 1988; Nordin 1990; Vallbo et al 1993) and activates the neural level the
130 posterior insula and orbitofrontal cortices (McGlone et al. 2012; Trotter et al. 2016).
132 Previous work outlined the beneficial effects of positive touch experiences produced by CT
133 optimal stroking touch (Fairhurst et al. 2014; Liljencrantz et al. 2017; Pawling et al. 2017; see
134 McGlone et al. 2007; Morrison et al. 2010 for reviews).The so-called affective or social touch
135 is considered to subserve key mechanisms of social bonding, reducing feelings of social
136 exclusion (von Mohr et al., 2017), soothing pain (Krahe et al., 2016; von Mohr et al., 2018)
137 and communicating social support (Kirsch et al., 2018; Fotopoulou et al. 2021). Evidence for
138 the rewarding nature of affective touch comes also from studies showing increased activity of
139 mu-opioid receptors (MOR) – considered to underpin the maintenance of close social
140 connectedness in humans (Pearce et al. 2017) – during social touch (Nummenmaa et al. 2016)
142 Interestingly, several studies found a strong link between the bodily self and the mechanisms
143 underlying vicarious touch, i.e. the automatic simulation of touch observed on another
144 person’s body (Keysers et al. 2004; Adler & Gillmeister 2019). Neuroimaging work outlined
145 that the passive observation of touch experienced by another individual elicits vicarious
146 activity in similar brain regions as those activated when touch is received by the individual on
147 her own body (Keysers et al. 2010; Lamm et al. 2011). Significant individual variability has
148 been reported in exploring vicarious responses to others’ sensory experiences (Gillmeister et
149 al. 2017).
152 For example, Morrison and colleagues (2011) reported that vicarious responses to dynamic
153 stroking touch are velocity tuned and socially specific. More recent studies found that
154 vicarious ratings of affective touch match the velocity tunning of CT afferents in adults
155 (Walker et al. 2017) and in children aged between 8 and 11 (Haggarty et al. 2021). In these
156 studies, participants viewed and rated short videos depicting one individual being touched by
157 another individual at different skin sites (back, upper arm, ventral forearm, dorsal forearm and
158 palm) at 3 different velocities (static, 3cm/s, 30cm/s). The authors report that the highest
159 ratings of reported pleasantness were for observing gentle stroking touch delivered at CT
160 optimal stroking.
162 Although self-touch and affective touch are increasingly recognized as playing a key role in
163 establishing one’s sense of self and social connectedness, little is known about the
164 relationship between affective touch and DP. This gap is surprising given that numerous self-
165 reports from people experiencing depersonalisation point to the importance of maintaining
166 close tactile contact and social interactions with the physical and social environment in order
167 to enhance one’s sense of self. In the words of one interviewees: “When the depersonalisation
168 is very deep, (…) it feels like that constant source of interaction is the only thing that allows
169 me to maintain a connection with the world. I'll also seek physical contact with whoever I'm
170 with.” (Ciaunica & Charlton 2018). Or again, coming from a person with lived experiences of
171 DP : “I really like when people scratch me or twist my arms or just touch me. It puts me back
172 in my body and makes me feel cared for” (Perkins 2021:87).
174 Here, we conducted an online study featuring two experiments aiming to examine the
175 relationship between DP experiences and vicarious affective touch and self-touch. The first
176 experiment built upon previous work by Walker and colleagues (2017) and explored to what
177 extent DP traits modulate the perceived pleasantness and/or vividness of tactile experiences as
178 imagined being received by the self and other. We hypothesised that the higher experiences of
179 depersonalisation (as measured by the Cambridge Depersonalisation Scale (CDS-29), Sierra
180 & Berrios 2000, see Methods below), the lower the perceived pleasantness and/or vividness
181 of the vicarious tactile experiences as imagined being received by both the self and other. By
182 contrast, people with low occurrences of depersonalisation should report higher perceived
183 pleasantness and vividness of tactile experiences imagined as being received by the self, as
184 opposed to the other.
186 In the second experiment we designed a new affective self-touch task (adapted from Walker
187 et al. 2017), aiming to explore the effect of CT-optimal self-touch stroking on one’s dorsal
188 forearm on the perceived pleasantness and vividness of tactile experiences as being received
189 by the self and other. We hypothesised that the dynamic and affective self-touch stroking (as
190 opposed to passive self-touch) will enhance the perceived vividness and pleasantness of the
191 social touch as imagined being received by the self and other in both people with high and
192 low DP experiences.
2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Participants
199 409 participants were pre-screened via the online platform SoSci Survey (Leiner, 2016) using
200 the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS-29) (Sierra & Berrios, 2000). From these, 108
201 eligible participants (Male =38, Female =67, non-binary =2, prefer not to say =1) (mean age =
202 26.92, SD = 5.034) completed the study in two groups: (a) 57 participants in the High DP
203 group with their score ≥50; and (b) and 51participants in the Low DP group with their scores
204 ≤20 on the CDS-29. CDS-29 score calculation used a procedure developed by Kanayama et
205 al. (2009) which ensures that the DP scores of the two groups are meaningfully distinct.
206 Previous studies have demonstrated that this procedure should yield a sensitivity threshold of
207 75.5% for DP patients in the High DP group (Sierra et al., 2005). Other criteria included: (a)
208 between 18 to 40 years old, (b) fluent English speakers, (c) right-handed and (d) without a
209 history of neurological illness. Informed consent was obtained from all participants before the
210 start of the experiment according to procedures approved by the Ethics Committee of the
211 Universität der Bundeswehr München. The experiment was conducted in accordance with the
212 Declaration of Helsinki.
2.2 Questionnaires
216 Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS-29 henceforth) (Sierra & Berrios, 2000) is a 29
217 items standard questionnaire used to evaluate the severity of occurrence of depersonalization
218 experiences. CDS-29 asks the participants to estimate the frequency and duration of their DP
219 symptoms. Frequency is characterized as how often the symptoms have occurred in the last 6
220 months and is measured on a 5-point Likert rating scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (all the
221 time) for each of the 29 items. Duration is measured on a 7-point Likert rating scale ranging
222 from 0 (few seconds) to 6 (more than a week) for each of the 29 items. A total score is
223 calculated by adding up the total frequency and duration scores and it can range between 0 to
224 290. CDS-29 has good statistical properties (Aponte-Soto, Vélez-Pastrana, Martínez-Taboas,
225 & González, 2014; Fagioli et al., 2015; Migliorini et al., 2012; Sierra & Berrios, 2000;
226 Sugiura et al., 2009) with internal reliability for different language versions reported between
227 0.89-0.94 (Cronbach alpha). Moreover, previous research has extracted four subscales from
228 CDS-29 (Sierra, Baker, Medford, & David, 2005): Anomalous Body Experience, Emotional
229 Numbing, Anomalous Subjective Recall, and Alienation from Surroundings.
230 Social Touch Questionnaire (STQ henceforth) (Wilhelm et al., 2001) is a 20-item assessing
231 the participants’ attitude towards social situations involving touch. It consists of items that
232 measure (i) giving/providing and (ii) getting/receiving touch along with touch involving
233 strangers and acquaintances. The items are measured on a 5-point Likert rating scale ranging
234 from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). An STQ score is calculated by adding up the values for
235 each item after carefully ensuring that half of the items are negatively scored. (Negative
236 items: 2,3,5,7,8,10,13,16,17,19). In this study, additionally a ‘Get’ and ‘Give’ score was
237 calculated. The former score indicates how comfortable a participant is being touched (getting
238 or receiving a touch), whereas the latter score indicates how comfortable the participant is and
239 their attitudes towards giving touch to friends or acquaintances. The ‘Give’ (Give items:
240 4,5,6,9,10,13,14,15,20) and ‘Get’ score (Get items: 1,2,3,7,8,11,12,17,18,19) were calculated
241 as a sum of their scores for their respective items.
242 Longing for interpersonal touch picture questionnaire (LITPQ henceforth) is a rather
243 novel method to measure longing for touch. It consists of two components i.e. touch
244 frequency and touch wish. Touch frequency is calculated by asking participants how often
245 they had performed a specific type of touch in the past week whereas touch wish is calculated
246 by asking participants how often they would have wanted to experience a specific type of
247 touch in the past week. In the present study, to measure both these components, participants
248 were required to respond on a slider under each picture ranging from 0 to 100 with 50 as the
249 midpoint. For this study, pictures with four different types of touch such as holding, stroking,
250 kissing and hugging were selected. Three scores were calculated as a result of this
251 questionnaire namely: (i) touch wish, (ii) touch frequency and (iii) total LITPQ score. Touch
252 frequency and touch wish was calculated as an average across all touch types. LITPQ score
253 was calculated by dividing touch wish by touch frequency, thereby creating a ratio of the two
254 scores.
General Procedure
256 2.3.
257 Initial pre-screening for depersonalisation traits via the CDS-29, was followed by a short
258 demographic questionnaire and completion of two experiments in a randomized order. In
259 experiment 1, participants were asked to imagine a social touch event occurring either to
260 themselves or another person (SELF/OTHER). In experiment 2, participants were again asked
261 to imagine being touched but this time, before and after a self-touch intervention that we have
262 designed (SELF TOUCH INTERVENTION). These two experiments are described in detail
263 below. The order of the two experiments was randomised across participants. Having
264 completed the two experiments, all participants filled (a) the Social Touch Questionnaire
265 (STQ) and (b) the Longing for Touch Interpersonal Picture Questionnaire (LITPQ).
Fig 1: Overview of the Experimental Design and Procedure
2.4 Design and Procedure Experiment 1 SELF/OTHER
273 In experiment 1, participants viewed a series of short videos (6s) depicting an individual’s
274 hand stroking another individual’s dorsal forearm at CT-optimal velocity (see Fig 1). In the
275 videos presented, the gender of the person being touched were matched according to the self-
276 declared gender of the participant; in all cases the person performing the stroking was female.
277 Previous work suggested that both sexes are likely to respond more homogenously to female
278 stroking (Gazzola et al., 2012). We first manipulated the “WHERE” factor, by presenting
279 videos in which participants observed a person gently stroking either another person’s (i)
280 dorsal forearm (the FOREARM condition) or (ii) back (the BACK condition) at the CT-
281 optimal speed. Secondly, we manipulated the “WHO” factor, namely: (i) in half of the trials,
282 participants were asked to imagine these tactile experiences as if it were happening to
283 themselves (the SELF condition). (ii) While in the other half, they were asked to imagine
284 these as happening to someone else (the OTHER condition). In this experiment, the
285 participants were presented with 1 practise block containing 1 trial followed by 2 test blocks
286 containing 5 trials each for the ‘self’ and ‘other’ blocks. Participants then completed the two
287 questionnaires STQ and LITPQ.
288 The study thus used a 2x2x2 within-subjects design with three independent variables: (a)
289 Experimental GROUP (Trait Depersonalisation - Low DP vs. High DP), (b) WHO was the
290 imagined person receiving the affective touch (SELF vs. OTHER); (c) WHERE, i.e., the place
291 on the body where the touch was delivered in the videos we have created with two levels
292 (BACK vs. dorsal FOREARM). The dependent variables of this experiment were perceived
293 pleasantness and vividness as rated on visual analogue scales presented after each video.
2.5 Design and procedure Experiment 2 INTERVENTION
298 In experiment 2, participants viewed short videos (6s) showing an individual’s hand stroking
299 another individual’s dorsal forearm (see Fig. 1). Here we have manipulated how the stroking
300 was performed (“HOW” factor) with videos showing stroking at either CT optimal velocity (3
301 m/s) or CT suboptimal velocity (30 m/s). Half of the participants (INTERVENTION group)
302 were shown a video with an incorporated audiovisual metronome, giving them the CT-
303 optimal pace of affective touch stroking. They were instructed to copy and perform on their
304 own left dorsal forearm the self-touch stroking with the CT-optimal velocity as shown in the
305 video. In the CONTROL group, participants were instructed to rest their right hand passively
306 on the opposite arm for the same duration as the self-intervention touch (i.e. 6 seconds). The
307 rationale behind this condition was to control for the effect of dynamic affective self-touch as
308 opposed to passive self-touch. The structure of this intervention experiment followed a pre-
309 post design with participants completing an imagined touch block before a touch intervention
310 (PRE), followed by a second imagined touch block (POST). The training session consisted of
311 one video followed by the two rating scales. PRE and POST blocks consisted of five trials
312 each. The intervention condition consisted of two trials.
314 The experiment had a between subject design including three independent variables: (i)
315 INTERVENTION with two levels (Affective Self-Touch Intervention vs. Static Self-Touch
316 Control), (ii) Experimental GROUP with two levels (High DP vs. Low DP) and (iii)
317 VELOCITY of the video stimuli presented with two levels (CT-optimal vs. non-CT-optimal).
318 The dependent variables of this experiment were perceived pleasantness and vividness which
319 were calculated as delta scores by subtracting the pre-test scores from the post-test scores.
Data types and analysis
322 2.6
324 The three questionnaires used in the study for pre-screening and the main study were
325 subjective self-report questionnaires. While CDS and STQ included Likert-rating scales
326 providing ratio data, participants had to respond to LITPQ items on a slider response scale for
327 each picture also providing ratio data. In both experiments, the variables of perceived
328 vividness and pleasantness were calculated using self-report measures on a slider response
329 scale and reaction time was recorded additionally, both, providing ratio data.The pre-
330 screening survey was conducted using the SosciSurvey (Leiner, 2016) platform. The
332 Irvine, Massonnié, Flitton, Kirkham & Evershed, 2018). Data was organised using Microsoft
333 Excel (Microsoft Corporation, 2018) and analysed using RStudio (RStudio Team, 2020).
334 Tests conducted include student t-tests, repeated measures ANOVAs and multiple regression.
3 Results
340 3.1 Results STQ Touch behaviour
341 Using a student t-test, we found a significant effect of experimental GROUP on reports of
342 touch behaviour as captured by the STQ (t (106) = -3.22, p < 0.01), with significantly higher
343 total scores for low DP individuals (M= 46.15) than high DP individuals (M= 38.28).
344 Additionally, we compared ‘give ‘vs. ‘get’ items (that is instances in which the individual is
345 either touching or being touched). We found that high DP (M= 19.19) individuals rate “get”
346 (being touched) items significantly lower (t (106) = - 4.23 , p < 0.001) compared to low DP
347 (M= 24.72) individuals. This is not the case for “give” (touching) items (t (106) = - 1.47 , p =
348 0.14) (Fig 2).
Questionnaire
354 3.2 Results Experiment 1
356 Using a 2X2X2 ANOVA with factors: (i) WHO (who was imagined as receiving the touch:
357 self vs other), (ii) WHERE (where the touch was delivered: back vs dorsal forearm), and (iii)
358 our experimental GROUP (low vs. high DP), we found several significant effects. Firstly, for
359 the perceived pleasantness variable, we find a significant interaction between our GROUP x
360 WHO factors (F= 13.38195, p < 0.001). Namely: the low DP group rated imagined tactile
361 experiences personally experienced (SELF) as more pleasant than imagined experiences as
362 experienced by the other (OTHER). By contrast, no difference between “self” and “other”
363 conditions are observed for the high DP group (see Fig 3).
365 Additionally, we find a significant main effect for pleasantness for (i) the experimental
366 GROUP (F= 15.85186, p < 0.001) and (ii) WHERE (F= 5.911614, p < 0.001) touch was
367 imagined (‘FOREARM’ vs ‘BACK’), confirming previous reports with the imagined “back”
368 touch scenarios being rated significantly more pleasant than the dorsal forearm. No
369 significant interaction effects were found for vividness ratings (though we see a main effect of
370 WHO (F= 7.192446, p < 0.001)).

379 Using a multiple regression, including the factors (i) INTERVENTION, (ii) GROUP and (iii)
380 CT stroking VELOCITY in our model, we identify a significant effect of intervention (β =
381 9.66, SE = 3.46, t = 2.78, p < 0.05). This indicates that both low and high DP participants,
382 following a self-touch intervention, report higher ratings of vividness of imagined tactile
383 experiences (see Fig. 4). No significant effect on the pleasantness of the imagined tactile
384 experiences has been found across condition.
4 Discussion
390 This study explored the relationship between depersonalisation experiences (feelings of being
391 detached from one’s self and body) and affective, social touch. Our analyses yielded evidence
392 for several notable findings.
394 First, as predicted, we found that DP significantly modulates the subjective rating of touch
395 experiences overall, with low DP individuals reporting higher perceived pleasantness and
396 vividness rating for touch. By contrast, the high DP cohort rated all touch experiences as
397 significantly less pleasant than their low DP counterparts. This suggest that people with
398 depersonalisation benefit less from the social and affective component of tactile experiences,
399 consistent of their common complaints of feeling affectively detached from the others and
400 unable to ‘feel love’ (Simeon and Abugel 2006; Sierra 2009; Perkins 2021).
402 Interestingly, no significant interaction effects for vividness ratings of touch experiences
403 across the groups of low versus high depersonalisation traits has been found. This is
404 surprising at first glance because, in line with previous work highlighting a close link between
405 atypical bodily self-awareness, social isolation and depersonalisation (Simeon & Abugel
406 2006; Sierra & David 2011), we have initially predicted that both the perceived pleasantness
407 and vividness of the tactile experiences will be overall higher in for the Low DP group, and
408 lower for the High DP group. However, our results suggest that the vividness and
409 pleasantness features of tactile experiences are underlined by two different mechanisms in
410 relation to DP. As we will see shortly below, this hypothesis seems to receive further support
411 from the results of our experiment 2, where we find this time a significant effect on vividness
412 but not pleasantness following the self-touch intervention in both low and high DP groups.
415 A third notable finding is that people with low DP rate the perceived pleasantness of the
416 imagined social touch experiences as received by the self higher than those received by the
417 other. Interestingly, in high DP individuals, there is no difference in the perceived
418 pleasantness of affective touch imagined as being received by the self and by the other.
420 Finally, we found that both low and high DP participants, following our tailored CT-optimal
421 affective self-touch intervention on one’s own body, report significantly higher ratings of
422 vividness of tactile perception. This is an important finding because it suggests that dynamic
423 and affective self-touch stroking on one’s own body may enhance the vividness of one’s
424 perceptual experiences, and potentially reduce thereby feelings of disembodiment and
425 unreality in people with DP. These findings seem to be supported further by DP
426 experiencers’ anecdotical self-reports highlighting the positive effect of dynamic proximal
427 tactile interactions with close others and the environment on one’s sense of self (Ciaunica et
428 al. 2021; Perkins 2021). As mentioned above, interestingly, no effect of the CT-optimal self-
429 touch intervention effect has been found on the pleasantness rating of touch experiences in
430 both low and high DP groups.
432 In what follows we discuss in detail the interpretations and potential implications of our
433 findings in turn.
435 We start by noting that in our study, people with low occurrences of DP experiences score
436 significantly higher on the Social Touch Questionnaire than their high DP counterparts.
437 Again, this is in line with previous self-reports from people experiencing DP noting a
438 significant impact of their disembodiment and self-detachment on the quality of their social
439 and emotional life: “I feel like a robot, I am looking at myself from the outside, but it is not
440 another voice or body, it is mine, it is me, it just doesn’t feel like it. Nothing makes it better
441 but being with other people makes it worse” (Baker et al., 2003: 431). Importantly, a recent
442 study by Millman and colleagues ( 2021) found that people clinically diagnosed with severe
443 depersonalisation tend to attribute their symptoms to social factors, which can lend insights
444 into people’s subjective appraisal of their symptoms.
447 Indeed, a core feature of DP is impaired processing of emotions (Blevins et al., 2013; Sierra et
448 al.,2002b), with a persistent decrease or loss of emotional reactivity, and emotions seem to
449 lack ‘realness’ and ‘colour’ (Baker et al. 2003 ; Simeon 2004; Simeon and Abugel 2006).
450 These subjective reports seem to be supported by empirical work suggesting that DdD
451 patients show attenuated responses to emotional stimuli ( Sierra et al. 2002; Medford et al.
452 2006). Moreover, DDD patients reporting high levels of subjective anxiety show attenuation
453 of autonomic sympathetic responses (Sierra et al. 2002; 2006).
455 Interestingly, as mentioned above, our study found no significant interaction effects for
456 vividness ratings of touch experiences across the groups of low versus high depersonalisation
457 traits. The lack of vividness effect may be explained by the fact that our study and
458 questionnaires were conducted online. Yet, the vividness of one’s experiences is closely
459 related with one’s dynamic presence in the tri-dimensional embodied reality of the here and
460 now (as opposed to the sedentary stance of the individual facing a two-dimensional, digital
461 reality presented on the screen). For example, a recent study (Ciaunica et al. 2021c) found
462 positive correlation between higher depersonalisation experiences and increased digital media
463 sedentary activities (e.g. playing computer game, watching TV, online e-meetings
464 participation, etc). This may explain why people with low occurrences of DP report the same
465 rates of vividness for touch experiences as their high DP counterparts. Further work is needed
466 however to test this hypothesis in a systematic way.
468 Another interesting effect revealed by our first experiment is that low DP people report higher
469 perceived pleasantness of the imagined social touch experiences as received by the self vs the
470 other. This seems to be in line with recent trends in mind and brain research stipulating that
471 our perceptions, cognitions and actions are intrinsically geared towards self-preservation
472 (Panksepp, 1998; Northoff & Panksepp, 2008; Ciaunica & Fotopoulou 2017; Seth & Tsakiris,
473 2018; Limanowski & Friston 2018). By maintaining and regulating the physiological needs
474 and integrity of the organism (the human body), perceptual awareness at the most basic level
475 is inherently “selfish”, that is self-centred, concerned with self-survival and self-care (Friston
476 2010; Seth & Tsakiris, 2018; Ciaunica & Crucianelli, 2019).
478 This idea seems to be captured nicely by the so-called ‘self-prioritization or ‘self-bias’ effect,
479 which is an effect demonstrating that people are faster and more accurate when processing
480 information related to the self. This robust effect seems to receive support from several lines
481 of empirical work.
483 There is rich evidence showing that one’s name, as well as images of one’s face are processed
484 faster and more accurately than other comparable stimuli (Alexopoulos et al. 2012; Alzueta,
485 et al. 2019). This effect seems to be in place early in development, with children between 6
486 and 10 years of age already showing self-prioritization (Maire et al. 2020). More recently, it
487 has been demonstrated that a similar effect can be reliably observed also for non-familiar
488 stimuli (e.g. geometrical shapes or avatar faces) that have been arbitrarily associated with the
489 self (Sui et al. 2009)
491 The self prioritization effect has been observed in instances when compared with family and
492 friends’ faces (Keyes & Brady 2010), suggesting that the prioritization is not due to a
493 familiarization effect (e.g. highly learned perceptual information), but rather it is related to the
494 special meaning that the self-face has for one’s sense of self. Taken together, these studies
495 are consistent with our findings showing that imagined social touch experiences as received
496 by the self vs the other are rated as being more pleasant in people with low occurrences of
497 depersonalisation experiences.
500 Interestingly however, while it is fairly well established that people benefit from affiliative
501 touch directed to the self (Gallace and Spence 2010), it is less clear why do people with high
502 DP do not show the same self-prioritization effect. Again, there are several potential
503 interpretations of these results.
505 First, one alternative is to argue, in line with Ward & Banissy (2015) that DP is associated
506 with reduced self-other distinction, which plays a key role in vicarious tactile perception.
507 Within this theoretical framework, atypical representations of bodily self have been linked to
508 individuals who experience vicarious pain. For example, Bowling and colleagues (2019)
509 found a strong positive relationship between trait depersonalisation and the tendency to
510 experience pain on their own body when viewing others in pain (mirror-pain synaesthesia).
511 They proposed that “impairments in the ability to distinguish and switch between self- and
512 other-relevant representations underlie conscious vicarious experience” ( Bowling et al.
513 2019:2). The key hypothesis here is that the self-other distinction is blurred, reduced, which
514 may alter the ability of high DP people to optimally keep track of one’s self, and benefit
515 thereby from the self-bias effect.
517 Previous work by Adler and colleagues (2016) used electroencephalography (EEG) to
518 demonstrate that increased DP experiences among healthy adults is associated with altered
519 tactile mirroring mechanisms with less of an activation for self-face related information
520 compared to those with low experience of DP. They argue that mirroring, especially for
521 events on one’s own face can be strongly affected by how connected the person feels to their
522 own bodily self. Their findings are in line with several studies suggesting a functional link
523 between self-related processing and mirroring processes (Cardini et al. 2011; Tajadura-
524 Jimenez et al. 2013; Serino et al. 2015).
527 This hypothesis received further support from a recent study by Farmer and colleagues (2020)
528 using the Visual Remapping of Touch (VRT; Serino et al., 2008) paradigm to explore self-
529 bias in visual tactile integration in non-clinical participants reporting high and low levels of
530 depersonalisation experiences. In typical population, the VRT effect is enhanced by self-
531 relevance with as stronger effect for one’s own compared to another’s face (Serino et al.,
532 2008), suggesting that self-representation plays a key role in mediating this process. A similar
533 effect has also been found for other body parts, namely the hands (Gillmeister, 2014),
534 suggesting that the VRT effect generalises to tactile perception in general. Strikingly, Farmer
535 and colleagues found that the high DP group showed a greater VRT effect when observing the
536 face of the other as opposed to the self.
539 A second route for interpreting why high DP people do not benefit from the self-prioritization
540 effect because of the potential top-down conflicts between explicit self-recognition and
541 feelings of detachment from the observed self. This hypothesis seems to be supported by
542 phenomenological self-reports of people with depersonalisation who consistently report
543 viewing their own face as if it was that of a stranger: “The loss of the sense of self is a
544 constantly perturbing experience. Looking at my face in the mirror feels like an
545 uncomfortable staring contest with a total stranger” ( Perkins 2021:41). Intriguingly, these
546 sensations of self-estrangement seem to be closely linked with feelings of disembodiment and
547 detachment from the reality: “I look in the mirror and it doesn’t feel like myself I’m looking
548 at. It’s like I’m floating, not actually experiencing the world, and slowly fading away into
549 nothing. It’s like I’m on autopilot in somebody’s else body” (Perkins 2021 :198) (see also
550 Simeon and Abugel 2006; Sierra 2009).
552 A third route to explain why DP people do not show preference for touch experiences
553 received by the self may be related to alterations in sensory imagery. For example, Lambert
554 and colleagues ( 2001) conducted a study on twenty-eight people diagnosed with
555 depersonalisation disorder (DDD) using self-report measures of imagery ability in relation to
556 a range of symptoms and in comparison with age- and sex-matched controls. They found that
557 symptoms of depersonalisation correlated with impaired ability to generate visual images.
558 This was particularly evident with images pertaining to the self and other people as opposed
559 to objects. It is currently an open question whether these alterations may apply also to all
560 sensory modalities (e.g. imagined touch versus imagined pictures). Our study seems to
561 suggest that tactile imagery may be impaired as well in people with high DP. Further work is
562 needed to answer these key questions, by contrasting imagery abilities in different sensory
563 modalities in people with DP.
565 Another notable finding is that high DP individuals rate “get” (being touched) items
566 significantly lower compared to low DP individuals. However, this is not the case for “give”
567 (touching) items. This seems to suggest again a tendency to move away from the sensing self.
568 Additionally, our study reveals a significant main effect for pleasantness on where the touch
569 is delivered, confirming previous reports with the imagined “back” touch scenarios being
570 rated significantly more pleasant than the dorsal forearm in both groups (Walker et al. 2017).
572 While our first experiment consisted in asking participants to passively watch short videos of
573 CT-optimal stroking and to rate vicarious tactile experiences of affective touch in relation to
574 the self and other, in experiment n°2 we have added a dynamic component. Specifically, our
575 CT-optimal self-touch intervention on one’s body (dorsal forearm) yielded several key results.
576 First, as anticipated we found that the dynamic CT-optimal self-touch stroking intervention
577 (as opposed to passive self-touch, i.e. right palm resting on the forearm) enhanced the
578 vividness of touch experiences in both people with high and low depersonalisation. This is a
579 key aspect, because it suggests that affective touch stroking modulates tactile perception not
580 only when it is delivered by others on one’s body, but also when it is delivered by oneself on
581 one’s own body. To our knowledge, this is the first study providing evidence that affective
582 self-touch influences one’s subjective tactile experiences in DP.
584 Again, there are several potential interpretations of these findings. First, as briefly mentioned
585 in the Introduction section, previous theoretical and empirical work outlined that among the
586 senses, touch has a special status in relation to both the body and the world and others. As
587 Merleau-Ponty famously pointed out, whilst vision “presents us with a spectacle spread out
588 before us at a distance”, in perceiving the world through touch, “I cannot forget in this case
589 that it is through my body that I go to the world” (1962:316). By directly mediating the
590 boundary between body and world, the skin inevitably distinguishes yet relates body and
591 world, as the two faces of the same coin. By gaining information about the world via touch,
592 the individual inherently gains information about oneself ‘for free’.
594 Moreover, the skin is the oldest and widest organ in terms of dimensions and functions
595 (Montagu, 1971; Field, 2001). By providing the organism with the most primitive means to
596 ‘meet’ and perceive the world, tactile experiences may constitute thereby the most ubiquitous
597 and basic experiential background ( Ciaunica &Fotopoulou, 2017; Fotopoulou & Tsakiris
598 2017; Ciaunica et al. 2021b).
600 Building upon the idea that affective touch is believed to play an important role to the sense
601 of body ownership (Crucianelli et al., 2013; 2018; van Stralen et al., 2014) and self-identity
602 (Panagiotopoulou et al., 2017), one may speculate that affective self-touch may increase the
603 vividness of perceptual experiences overall. Our findings complement previous work
604 suggesting that voluntary active self-touch (as opposed to passive self-touch) increased body
605 ownership over a virtual hand, showing an important role for active self-touch in the
606 formation of the bodily self ( Hara et al. 2015).
609 Interestingly, our study found no significant effect of the CT-optimal self-stroking on the
610 pleasantness of the experiences across conditions. As mentioned previously, this suggests that
611 perceived vividness and pleasantness of tactile experiences are underpinned by two distinct
612 mechanisms in relation to self-detachment in DP. One may speculate that the pleasantness
613 aspect of affective touch experiences is intrinsically related to a social component. Seminal
614 studies illustrated that we automatically anticipate the sensory effects of self-initiated actions
615 (Wolpert & Kawato 1998), which explains why people typically cannot tickle themselves
616 (Blakemore et al., 1998). Similarly, we typically prefer to receive a massage from another
617 close person, rather than a self-massage. By contrast, the vividness of self-touch experiences
618 may be related to a functional, rather than social component. For example, for basic survival
619 reasons, one must be able to keep track of one’s body and provide immediate soothing in case
620 of harmful events (e.g. humans typically self-stroke instinctively painful body parts after a
621 harmful stimuli). This suggests that self-touch may have a potential soothing effect and
622 decrease the impact of nociceptive stimuli as shown by work on the role of self-touch in
623 somatosensory and body representation disorders after stroke (van Stralen et al. 2011).
625 Our study has several important limitations. First, the study was conducted online, hence we
626 were unable to control how accurately our participants followed our instructions (e.g. whether
627 they attentively watched the videos, or whether they correctly performed the CT-optimal self-
628 stroke on their dorsal forearms as instructed). Moreover, further work needs to contrast the
629 conditions where the CT-optimal stroking is delivered on one’s body by oneself versus a
630 close/trusted other, or the experimenter in people with high and low DP experiences. For
631 example, it would be interesting to examine whether CT-optimal stroking delivered by others
632 (as opposed to self-touch) will increase both the vividness and pleasantness of tactile
633 experience in both groups (low and high DP). Another important limitation is that our study
634 was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current exceptional context encourages
635 people to avoid as much as possible proximal tactile interactions with others and the
636 surroundings (aiming at limiting the risks of potential infection). Hence the touch-related
637 social behaviours may be disrupted by this atypical context, and it would important to conduct
638 a follow-up study post-pandemic to confirm the same pattern of findings.
5. Conclusion
643 Depersonalisation is a very common dissociative experience that makes people feel detached
644 from their bodily self. We have conducted an online study featuring two experiments looking
645 at the relationship between DP and affective touch and self-touch.
648 In experiment 1, we explored to what extent DP traits modulate the perceived pleasantness and
649 vividness of tactile experiences as imagined being received by the self and other. Experiment 2
650 used a newly designed affective self-touch intervention in order to explore the effect of CT-
651 optimal self-touch stroking on one’s dorsal forearm on the perceived pleasantness and vividness
652 of tactile experiences as being received by the self and other. We found that DP modulates the
653 vicarious rating of touch experiences, such as low DP individuals reported higher perceived
654 pleasantness and vividness rating for touch. By contrast, the high DP cohort rated all touch
655 experiences as significantly less pleasant. No significant interaction effects for vividness ratings
656 of touch experiences across low and high DP.
658 In addition, our results suggest that people with low DP rate the perceived pleasantness of the
659 imagined social touch experiences as received by the self higher than if received by the other.
660 Intriguingly, in high DP individuals, there is no difference in the perceived pleasantness of
661 affective touch imagined as being received by the self vs the other. Finally, we found that both
662 low and high DP participants, following our tailored CT-optimal affective self-touch
663 intervention on one’s own body, report significantly higher ratings of vividness of tactile
664 perception.
666 Our study points to several potential important implications. For example, the finding that
667 CT-optimal self-touch delivered by both people with low and high DP experiences on their
668 own bodies (dorsal forearms) modulates the perceived vividness of tactile experiences,
669 suggests that our approach may be used to design affective self-touch based interventions.
670 These may help isolated people that feel detached from their own self, body and the world, to
671 enhance the vividness of their experiences and potentially increase their sense of “realness” or
672 “presence “ in their own bodies and the world (Ciaunica et al. 2021a).
674 This is important because tactile perception is pivotal not only in establishing affective bonds
675 with others, but also in constituting our embodied sense of self. Indeed, DP has highly
676 distressing effects on the quality of one’s mental and social life, often and strikingly reported
677 as having an opaque “fog” or “veil” interposed between one’s self, body and the world
678 (Simeon & Abugel, 2006; Sierra 2019; Ciaunica & Charlton, 2018).
680 Given that our skin is not just a mere border (separating the self from the others/world), but
681 also a bridge connecting the self to its environment, then one may use proximal skin-to-skin
682 interactions as a handy mean to ‘dissolve’ this fog, and to ‘get back in touch’ with the ‘lost’
683 self.
