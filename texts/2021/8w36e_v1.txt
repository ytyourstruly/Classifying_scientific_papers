UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 2
Abstract
Many researchers have found that unfolding models may better represent how respondents
answer Liker-type items and response styles (RSs) often have moderate to strong presence in
responses to such items. However, the two research lines have been growing largely in parallel.
The present study proposed an unfolding item response tree (UIRTree) model that can account
for unfolding response process and RSs simultaneously. An empirical illustration showed that
the UIRTree model could fit a personality dataset well and produced more reasonable
parameter estimates. Strong presence of the extreme response style (ERS) was also revealed
by the UIRTree model. We further conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study to examine the
performance of the UIRTree model compared to three other models for Likert-scale responses:
the Samejima’s graded response model, the generalized graded unfolding model, and the
dominance item response tree (DIRTree) model. Results showed that when data followed
unfolding response process and contained the ERS, the AIC was able to select the UIRTree
model, while BIC was biased towards the DIRTree model in many conditions. In addition,
model parameters in the UIRTree model could be accurately recovered under realistic
conditions, and wrongly assuming the item response process or ignoring RSs was detrimental
to the estimation of key parameters. In general, the UIRTree model is expected to help in better
understanding of responses to Liker-type items theoretically and contribute to better scale
development practically. Future studies on multi-trait UIRTree models and UIRTree models
accounting for different types of RSs are expected.

Accounting for Item Response Process and Response Styles Using the Unfolding Item
Response Tree (UIRTree) Model
As more and more studies have found that non-cognitive variables like personality and
vocational interests are robust predictors of important life outcomes such as job performance,
academic achievement, and subjective well-being (e.g., Anglim et al., 2020; Judge et al., 2013;
Nye et al., 2012, 2021; Poropat, 2009), non-cognitive assessment has become increasingly
popular in many contexts. For example, personality tests are widely used for personnel
selection (Feintzeig, 2015). The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) also included personality and vocational interest as a core assessment component for
the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (OECD, 2018).
Non-cognitive assessments often rely on Likert scales in which respondents are asked
to indicate their degree of agreement with items. Responses are then subjected to models like
Samejima’s Graded Response Model (SGRM; Samejima, 1969) to estimate respondents’
standings on the latent trait continuum. The legitimacy of using models like SGRM is
contingent upon two assumptions: (1) respondents follow a dominance response process such
that there is a monotonically increasing relationship between the latent trait level and the
probability of endorsing the item, and (2) responses to items within a scale is systematically
influenced by the focal trait. However, past studies suggest that both assumptions may not be
tenable. For example, regarding the first assumption, it has been shown that the unfolding
response process (that assumes an inverted U-shaped relationship between the probability of
endorsing an item and a respondent’s latent trait level) better represents how individuals
respond to items measuring non-cognitive constructs (Cao et al., 2015; Drasgow et al., 2010;
Tay et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020). As for the second assumption, numerous
studies have shown that there are stable individual differences in response styles (RSs) -- the
idiosyncratic use of response options regardless of item content and their levels of latent trait
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 4
(Wetzel et al., 2016). It means that the same observed score on an item may represent different
levels of trait for different individuals because some individuals are more likely to use extreme
response options, while others are more likely to use nonextreme options, rendering scores less
comparable across individuals. Failure to address either assumption will result in biased
estimates of item and person parameters, which can have severe consequences for scale
development, scoring, and selection outcomes.
Many efforts have been devoted to resolving issues of the response process and RSs.
For example, Roberts and colleagues (2000) developed the Generalized Graded Unfolding
Model (GGUM) to better model the unfolding response process, which has been successfully
applied to many non-cognitive assessments. Further, item response tree (IRTree) models have
been proposed and well-received as a flexible tool for handling RSs (e.g., Böckenholt, 2012,
2017, 2019; Henninger & Meiser, 2020; Jeon & De Boeck, 2016; Lang et al., 2019; Lang &
Tay, 2019; Lievens et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2021). However, the two lines of research have been
developing in parallel, and researchers concerned about the response process often overlook
the issue of RSs, and vice versa. There is a need to integrate the two lines of research to more
optimally assess non-cognitive constructs.
Therefore, the present study presents an unfolding item response tree (UIRTree) model
that simultaneously accounts for RSs and the unfolding response process for non-cognitive
assessment. Specifically, Study 1 used an empirical dataset to reveal the magnitude of extreme
response style (ERS) and the presence of unfolding response process, as well as the (costs)
benefits of (not) modeling them. Study 2 adopted a simulation design to systematically examine
the statistical performance of the UIRTree model and the power of AIC and BIC for accurate
model selection. A user-friendly tutorial on how to fit the model in the R package mirt
(Chalmers, 2012) is also provided. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to
combine the IRTree model and the unfolding model.
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 5
Unfolding response process and the GGUM
Two distinct types of models have been proposed to describe how individuals respond
to Likert-type items. Dominance models assume that the probability of a stronger endorsement
of an item increases monotonically as their trait level increases. Though often not explicitly
stated, most commonly used psychometric models belong to dominance models (e.g.,
Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Rasch model, 2-Parameter Logistic Model [2PLM], and
SGRM). Dominance models are well suited for tests measuring “maximal behaviors” that
challenge the limits of individual’s capacity, such as cognitive or psychomotor tests (Tay &
Drasgow, 2012; Tay & Ng, 2018). One of the most common dominance models is the SGRM
with the model equation:
exp⁡(𝛼 𝜃 −𝛿 )
𝑖 𝑗 𝑖𝑘
𝑃(𝑌 ≥ 𝑘|𝜃 ) = , (1)
𝑖 𝑗
1+exp⁡(𝛼 𝜃 −𝛿 )
𝑖 𝑗 𝑖𝑘
where 𝑌 is the subjective response to item 𝑖,⁡𝜃 is the location of individual 𝑗 on the latent
𝑖 𝑗
continuum, 𝛼 is the discrimination of item 𝑖 , 𝛿 is the difficulty parameter (also called
𝑖 𝑖𝑘
category threshold parameter) of item 𝑖 to achieve a category no smaller than 𝑘.
For measures that assess “self-reported typical thoughts and behaviors,” such as
personality, respondents tend to first gauge the degree of match between their true levels of
thoughts/behaviors and the levels of thoughts/behaviors conveyed by the item (or the distance
between the item location and the respondent’s latent trait level). The closer the item content
matches the respondent’s true self, the higher the probability that the respondent will endorse
the item. For example, the item “I am as extraverted as an average person” describes an average
level of extraversion. A very extraverted or introverted individual is less likely to endorse this
item as the degree of extraversion conveyed by this item does not match that of the respondents.
Moderately extraverted individuals are more likely to endorse this item as there is a close match.
Therefore, unfolding models are more appropriate for the assessment of typical behaviors (Tay
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 6
models. Adopting the appropriate measurement model aligned with the response process
underling the target construct is a fundamental issue for measurement validity (Borsboom et
al., 2004).
Among the unfolding models, GGUM is no doubt the most widely used one due to 1)
its capability to describe the unfolding process, 2) ease of interpretation, and 3) the availability
of free software for parameter estimation. According to Roberts et al. (2000), the GGUM
assumes that an observed response can result from two possible subjective responses. Each of
the two subjective responses corresponds to an individual’s position either above or below the
item’s location on the latent continuum. As a result, an item with categories 𝑧 = 0,1,2, … , 𝐶
would correspond to subjective responses 𝑦 = 0,1,2, … , 𝑀, where 𝑀 = 2𝐶 + 1. All subjective
responses follow a generalized partial credit model (Muraki, 1992) with the model equation:
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 7
𝑒𝑥𝑝{𝛼 [𝑦(𝜃 −𝛿 )−∑ 𝜏 ]}
𝑖 𝑗 𝑖 𝑖𝑘
𝑃(𝑌 = 𝑦|𝜃 ) = 𝑘=0 , (2)
𝑖 𝑗
𝑀 𝑤
∑ {𝑒𝑥𝑝{𝛼 [𝑤(𝜃 −𝛿 )−∑ 𝜏 ]}}
𝑤=0 𝑖 𝑗 𝑖 𝑘=0 𝑖𝑘
where 𝑌 is the subjective response to item 𝑖,⁡𝜃 is the location of individual 𝑗 on the latent
𝑖 𝑗
continuum, 𝛼 is the discrimination of item 𝑖 , 𝛿 is the location of item 𝑖 on the latent
𝑖 𝑖
𝑡ℎ
continuum, and 𝜏 is the threshold of the 𝑘 option for item 𝑖 . To establish model
𝑖𝑘
identifiability, a model constraint is set that ∑ 𝜏 = 0. The model equation for the observed
𝑘=0 𝑖𝑘
response to time 𝑖, 𝑍 , is then defined as:
𝑃(𝑍 = 𝑧|𝜃 ) = 𝑃(𝑌 = 𝑧|𝜃 ) + 𝑃(𝑌 = 𝑊 − 𝑧|𝜃 )
𝑖 𝑗 𝑖 𝑗 𝑖 𝑗

𝑒𝑥𝑝{𝛼 [𝑧(𝜃 −𝛿 )−∑ 𝜏 ]}+𝑒𝑥𝑝{𝛼 [(𝑀−𝑧)(𝜃 −𝛿 )−∑ 𝜏 ]}

𝑤=0 𝑖 𝑗 𝑖 𝑘=0 𝑖𝑘 𝑖 𝑗 𝑖 𝑘=0 𝑖𝑘
Over the past two decades, GGUM has been shown to provide a better fit than
dominance models to data of personality (Chernyshenko et al., 2007; Carter et al., 2014;
Drasgow et al., 2012), interests (Tay et al., 2009), job satisfaction (Carter & Dalal, 2010),
emotional intelligence (Cho et al., 2015), attachment style (Sun et al., 2021), interpersonal
values (Ling et al., 2016), and attitude (Roberts et al., 1999). Mis-specifying an unfolding
model as a dominance model will lead to biased item parameter estimates (e.g., truly well-
performing items showing low discrimination power) and adversely impact item selection. It
will also result in distorted rankings of individuals, especially for those at the two ends of the
trait continuum, thus hampering the quality of selection decision (Stark et al., 2006), reducing
criterion-related validity (Sun et al., 2021), and lowering the power to detect curvilinear effects
(Cao et al., 2018; Carter et al., 2017).
Response styles and the IRTree model
Response styles (RSs) refer to tendencies to choose response options in systematic but
content-irrelevant ways (Baumgartner & Steenkamp, 2001). For example, extreme response
style (ERS) is the tendency to choose extreme options. It has been consistently demonstrated
that RSs exist in non-cognitive measurements (Batchelor & Miao, 2016; Baumgartner &
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 8
Steenkamp, 2001; Rorer, 1965), and the presence of RSs may distort the measurement of the
construct of interest, which leads to estimation bias and threatens measurement validity (Eid &
Rauber, 2000; Johnson & Bolt, 2010; McDaniel et al., 2011; Moors, 2004; Plieninger, 2017).
Among the many approaches to handling RSs, the IRTree model (Böckenholt, 2012;
De Boeck & Partchev, 2012) exhibits its great advantages of disassociating the focal trait and
RSs while measuring them simultaneously. Evidence from many empirical studies shows that
different types of RSs can be well addressed by the IRTree model (i.e., Ames & Myers, 2020;
De Boeck & Partchev, 2012; Jeon & De Boeck, 2019; Zettler et al., 2016). Since IRTree models
in previous studies all assumed a dominance response process, we term such IRTree models as
dominance IRTree (DIRTree) models in contrast to the proposed UIRTree model in the rest of
this article.
In the DIRTree model, an item with polytomous responses is decomposed into several
sub-items given a tree structure where the sub-items are represented by nodes, and the item
categories are represented by leaves (i.e., end-nodes). In RS analyses with the DIRTree model,
items are decomposed into focal trait-related and RS-related sub-items. In this way, both the
focal trait and RSs can be measured by their respective sub-items without being influenced by
each other, and their latent correlations can be easily estimated. For instance, let us consider a
four-point item with categories 0,1,2 and 3 corresponding to “strongly disagree,” “disagree,”
“agree,” and “strongly agree,” respectively. We can use an IRTree structure to separate the
item into three binary sub-items that are to measure whether an observed response is negative
(i.e., category 0 or 1) or positive (i.e., category 2 or 3); if negative, whether it is extreme (i.e.,
category 0) or not (i.e., category 1); if positive, whether it is extreme (i.e., category 3) or not
(i.e., category 2). Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume that the first sub-item measures the
focal trait while the last two sub-items reflect the ERS. In this way, we are able to fit a two-
factor item response model with the first sub-item loading on the focal trait and the last two
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 9
sub-items loadings on the ERS. If we adopt the 2PLM for the first sub-item and the Rasch
model (Rasch, 1960) for the last two sub-items, the model equations in the DIRTree model are:
𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝛼 𝜃 −𝛿 )
𝑖 𝑗 𝑖
𝑃(𝑈 = 1|𝜁 ) = , (4)
1𝑖 𝑗
1+𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝛼 𝜃 −𝛿 )

𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝜁 −𝛽 )

𝑗 3𝑖
𝑃(𝑈 = 1|𝜁 ) = , (6)
3𝑖 𝑗
1+𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝜁 −𝛽 )

where 𝑈 is the response to the 𝑛 sub-item of item 𝑖, 𝜃 is the location of individual 𝑗 on the
𝑛𝑖 𝑗
continuum of the focal trait, 𝛼 is the discrimination parameter on the focal trait, 𝛿 is the
𝑖 𝑖
location of the first sub-item of item 𝑖 on the focal trait, 𝜁 is the location of individual 𝑗 on the
continuum of the ERS, 𝛽 is the location of the second sub-item of item 𝑖 on the continuum of
2𝑖
the ERS, and 𝛽 is the location of the third sub-item of item 𝑖 on the continuum of the ERS.

Accordingly, the probability for each observed response to item 𝑖, 𝑈 , can be defined as follows:
𝑃(𝑈 = 0|𝜃 , 𝜁 ) = 𝑃(𝑈 = 0|𝜃 )𝑃(𝑈 = 1|𝜁 ), (7)
𝑖 𝑗 𝑗 1𝑖 𝑗 2𝑖 𝑗

𝑃(𝑈 = 3|𝜃 , 𝜁 ) = 𝑃(𝑈 = 1|𝜃 )𝑃(𝑈 = 1|𝜁 ). (10)

The UIRTree Model and Its Estimation
Despite the fruitful development in DIRTree models and unfolding models, the two
lines of research have not crossed paths yet. As noted above, it is equally important to address
issues of RSs and unfolding responding to achieve better measurement validity and more
accurate estimates of item and item parameters. Therefore, we take the first step to join the two
lines of research and propose the UIRTree model.
Similar to the DIRTree model, the UIRTree model also decomposes items with
polytomous responses into different nodes representing different sub-items. The major
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 10
difference between the two models lies in how we model the sub-item that corresponds to the
focal trait (e.g., “disagree” vs “agree”). As Equation 4 shows, the DIRTree model adopts a 2PL
model assuming that respondents with a higher level of higher latent trait are more likely to
“agree.” In contrast, the UIRTree model assumes an unfolding response process for the node
representing the focal trait and adopts GGUM for it. Take the aforementioned four-point item
as an example. After being decomposed, the first sub-item representing the focal trait is fitted
by GGUM with the model equation:
𝑒𝑥𝑝{𝛼 [(𝜃 −𝛿 )−𝜏 ]}+𝑒𝑥𝑝{𝛼 [2(𝜃 −𝛿 )−𝜏 ]}
𝑖 𝑗 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑗 𝑖 𝑖
𝑃(𝑈 = 1|𝜃 ) = , (11)
1𝑖 𝑗
1+𝑒𝑥𝑝{𝛼 [3(𝜃 −𝛿 )−𝜏 ]}+𝑒𝑥𝑝{𝛼 [(𝜃 −𝛿 )−𝜏 ]}+𝑒𝑥𝑝{𝛼 [2(𝜃 −𝛿 )−𝜏 ]}
𝑖 𝑗 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑗 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖 𝑗 𝑖 𝑖
where 𝛿 is the location of the first sub-item of item 𝑖 on the continuum of the focal trait, and
the meanings of the item parameters 𝛼 , 𝛿 , and 𝜏 are the same as in Equations 2 and 3. The
𝑖 𝑖 𝑖
second and third sub-items representing the ERS can be fitted by any dichotomous dominance
models. If the Rasch model is adopted, then the model equations for the two sub-items are the
same as Equations 5-6 in the UIRTree model. Lastly, the same as for the DIRTree model, the
model equations of the observed response to item 𝑖, 𝑈 , are Equations 7-10 in the UIRTree
model.
2. It should be noted that, just like the DIRTree model, the UIRTree model represents a general
framework and can be easily extended in multiple ways to test different hypotheses. For
example, we can replace the Rasch model for the last two sub-items with more complex models
such as the 2PL model and use model fit comparison to select the best-fitting model. In addition,
responses can also be decomposed following different tree structures to explore other types of
RSs. Multidimensionality of focal traits can also be easily handled. We provided coding
schemas for different tree structures and corresponding R scripts for estimation in the tutorial.
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 11
sub-items. The first sub-item is estimated with the GGUM and the last two sub-items
are estimated with the Rasch model. The four leaves of the tree structure represent the
four item categories.
DIRTree models can be easily fitted using many latent variable modeling software
programs that can deal with categorical data (e.g., Mplus, lavaan). However, the estimation of
UIRTree model is trickier. Most latent variable modeling software programs are designed for
dominance models, and software programs for unfolding models like GGUM2004 (Roberts et
al., 2006) or R packages GGUM (Tendeiro & Castro-Alvarez, 2019) and bmggum (Tu et al.,
2021) can only handle unfolding models. Fortunately, the R package mirt (Chalmers, 2012) is
capable of dealing with both dominance and unfolding models. Specifically, mirt allows the
specification of hybrid models where a subset of items follow dominance models and the other
subset of items follow unfolding models. Estimation of such hybrid models is what we need
for the UIRTree models because sub-items related to focal traits need to be fitted by GGUM
and sub-items related to RSs need to be fitted by dominance models. Another feature of mirt
that makes it particularly suitable for the UIRTree model is that researchers can easily specify
priors for any parameters. Marginal maximum likelihood (MML) estimation of GGUM is
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 12
known for issues of convergence and extreme estimates (e.g., δ = 30 or δ = 100), especially
est se
for scales with a smaller number of response categories. Incorporating priors into the estimation
process (marginal maximum a posterior; MMAP) can greatly stabilize the estimation process
and provide reasonable estimates without sacrificing computation efficiency (Roberts &
Thompson, 2011). Additionally, various model/person fit indices, scoring methods, and
plotting functions are readily available in mirt such that users can easily carry out many post-
estimation analyses. Therefore, we chose mirt as the estimation engine for the UIRTree model.
It should be noted that Javaras and Ripley (2007) and Liu and Wang (2018) also
developed two non-IRTree models to handle the unfolding response process and RSs
simultaneously. Despite all the merits of these two models, they are still limited in the following
ways. First, Javaras and Ripley (2007) operationalized RSs as an individual difference in
thresholds and did not specify the type(s) of RSs that is accounted for. The conceptual
ambiguity of RSs in this model may make it less useful when researchers are interested in the
nature of a specific type of RS (e.g., stability and correlates of the ERS). Second, Liu and Wang
(2018) constrained threshold parameters in their model to be the same across items to achieve
stable estimates. Such constraints may be hard to justify theoretically. Moreover, both models
have to be estimated by specific software that is not very accessible to substantive researchers.
The UIRTree model is intended as an alternative model that shares the same logic as the popular
DIRTree model, is more intuitive and user-friendly, and overcomes some limitations of the two
earlier models.
The Present Study
Utilizing an empirical personality dataset that included extreme and intermediate items,
Study 1 aims to demonstrate the necessity of accounting for RSs and the unfolding response
process by examining (1) the strength of the ERS (2) the type of response process, and (3) the
consequences of failing to adopt the UIRTree model. Having shown the necessity of the
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 13
UIRTree model, Study 2 used Monte Carlo simulation to systematically examine the statistical
performance of the UIRTree model and whether information criteria (AIC & BIC) can
effectively select the correct model.
Study 1. Empirical Illustration
Datasets
A published personality dataset was reanalyzed, where researchers measured the
orderliness, dominance, and curiosity facets of personality (Cao et al., 2015). The authors
included 4 positively worded items, 4 negatively worded items, and 12 intermediate items for
each construct. Each item was rated on a four-point scale (“strongly disagree,” “disagree,”
“agree,” and “strongly agree”). The reason why we chose this dataset is that they included
extreme and intermediate items, which are critical for revealing the unfolding response process.
The dataset has not been analyzed using the DIRTree or UIRTree model before. Cronbach’s
αs of the three facets were 0.84, 0.77, and 0.871. There were 355 undergraduates from a large
Midwestern university in the United States in total. Among them, 71% were female. There
were 70.1% White, 15.2% Asian, 5.9% Hispanic or Latino, 5.6% Black or African American,
and 3.1% others.
Analytic details
In order to thoroughly examine both the presence of ERS and the type of response
process, we chose four candidate models: the SGRM (assuming no ERS and a dominance
response process; Equation 1), the GGUM (assuming no ERS and an unfolding response
process; Equation 3), the DIRTree model (assuming ERS and a dominance response process;
Equations 4-10), and the UIRTree model (assuming ERS and an unfolding response process;
1 We note that the computation of Cronbach’s α is also (implicitly) based on the dominance assumption.
Technically speaking, Cronbach’s α is not appropriate for unfolding models. Here we presented thess numbers
just in case some readers may be interested.
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 14
Equations 5-10 and 11). All models were fitted to each facet of the dataset using the R package
mirt 1.33.2 (Chalmers, 2012) with the MMAP estimator. In all models, the focal trait was
specified to follow a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of one.
In the DIRTree and UIRTree models, a Rasch model was adopted for ERS such that the mean
of ERS was fixed to be zero while its variance and its correlation with the focal trait were freely
estimated. To stabilize the estimation of the UIRTree model, a log𝑁(0.2, 0.5) prior was set for
the discrimination parameters 𝛼 , and a 𝑁(0, 3) prior was set for the location parameters 𝛿 .
𝑖 𝑖
No priors were set for other parameters. As MMAP is a full-information estimator, missing
data was automatically handled. The datasets and associated R scripts can be found in the online
supplementary material.
Results
Model comparisons
AIC and BIC were used to compare the relative model fit of the four candidate models.
Across all three facets, it was consistent that the UIRTree model outperformed the GGUM and
the DIRTree model outperformed the SGRM with respect to AIC and BIC, indicating that it is
necessary to model ERS. As for the comparison between the UIRTree model and the DIRTree
model, AIC and BIC suggested different results. Specifically, two out of three facets had
smaller AIC when estimated with the UIRTree model versus the DIRTree model. In
comparison, all three facets had smaller BIC when estimated with the DIRTree model versus
the UIRTree model. Therefore, whether the items followed the dominance response process or
the unfolding response process remained unclear, especially given that the discrimination
power of AIC and BIC has never been investigated in such scenarios before.

Estimates of the ERS
Across the three facets in the dataset, the variances of the ERS were estimated to be
1.62, 2.89, and 1.58 in the UIRTree model and 1.61, 2.92, and 1.58 in the DIRTree model,
suggesting that ERS had a strong impact on item responses.
The absolute values of estimated latent correlations between focal traits and ERS were
.33, .33, and.25 in the UIRTree model, and were .31, .34, and .28 in the DIRTree model. The
weak to moderate correlation estimates indicated that focal traits and ERS were well
differentiated. We also calculated the correlation between ERS factor scores derived from the
correlated with each other, with correlations ranging from .54 to .59. The omega coefficient
based on the one-factor model was .79 for both the UIRTree and the DIRTree models,
suggesting the existence of a strong general ERS factor. Taken together, these results cogently
showed that (1) ERS has a strong presence, (2) ERS is distinct from focal traits, and (3) there
is a strong general ERS factor across scales. Therefore, it is important to model ERS.

Key parameter estimates
Having shown the presence of a strong ERS factor, we further compared a common set
of estimated parameters from the GGUM and the UIRTree model to examine the benefits of
UIRTree model. Specifically, both models provided information about the discrimination
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 17
power (𝛼) and location (𝛿) of each item on the focal trait. These parameters are key to item
selection during the scale development stage. For example, scale developers often aim for a set
of items with high discrimination power and varying location parameters for better
measurement (Tay & Ng, 2018). Items that do not meet these criteria are often removed from
further consideration.
Several interesting patterns emerged. First, item discrimination parameters 𝛼 on the
focal trait obtained from the UIRTree model tended to be higher compared to those from the
GGUM, indicating that the ERS may mask the discrimination power of items and make
psychometrically sound items look unsatisfactory2. Second, 𝛿 estimates from the UIRTree
model for most intermediate items – those predicted to have close-to-zero δs – were close to
zero and showed clear unfolding while many of these parameters from the GGUM deviated
substantially from zero. As expected, the positively and negatively worded items had more
extreme location estimates than intermediate items in both models. The close correspondence
between theoretical prediction and empirical estimates provides strong support for the validity
of the UIRTree model.
Focal trait factor scores
We further looked into factor scores of the focal traits to examine the impact of the ERS.
The empirical reliability estimates of factor scores of the focal traits in the four estimation
relatively lower empirical reliability in the two IRTree models as four data points were
contributing to the estimation of focal trait scores in the SGRM and GGUM, while only two
data points contributed in the UIRTree and the DIRTree models. Whereas, in comparison to

focal trait compared to the SGRM, which further provided evidence of the masking effect of the ERS.
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 18
the DIRTree model, the UIRTree model had clearly better empirical reliability across the three
facets, which indicated that the estimates from the UIRTree model were more reliable.

We also calculated the correlations between factor scores of the same personality facet

scores of the models that accounted for ERS (i.e., the DIRTree model and the UIRTree model)
and the models that did not account for ERS (i.e., the SGRM and the GGUM) were from .85
to .93. While being high, these correlations were still clearly below one, indicating that ERS
showed that focal-trait factor scores of respondents with extreme values were impacted the
most by the ERS. It is expected since extreme responses were completely accounted for the
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 19
focal trait and brought about extreme factor scores in the models without ERS, whereas they
were explained by the ERS in the models with ERS.
Discussion
Using an empirical dataset, we found that (1) AIC and BIC consistently indicated that
the two IRTree models fitted the data better than the SGRM and the GGUM, though less
consistent evidence was found for the differentiation between the DIRTree and UIRTree
models; (2) ERS had a strong presence in the item responses across scales; (3) the UIRTree
model provided more reasonable item parameter estimates (i.e., higher discrimination
parameters for most items and less extreme location parameters for intermediate items) that
were more aligned with theory compared to the GGUM; and (4) unmodeled ERS impacted the
rank order of individuals and inflated correlations among distinct facets. The results provided
preliminary support for the validity of the UIRTree model. However, two key questions
remained to be answered before we can confidently embrace the UIRTree model. First, the
DIRTree model and the UIRTree model could not be clearly differentiated by AIC and BIC,
which leads to a question about the discrimination power (i.e., the power to correctly select the
model that describes the data best) of AIC and BIC in terms of model selection. Second, it is
also important to determine how accurately parameters can be recovered for the UIRTree
model and what factors will impact the estimation accuracy. A Monte Carlo simulation study
is needed to answer these questions. Given that most previous studies on IRTree models did
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 20
not conduct simulation studies to examine their statistical performance, it is extremely
important to provide such evidence.
Study 2. Simulation Study
Simulation Design
We generated four types of four-point data sets that were either with or without the ERS
and following either the unfolding or dominance response process. Specifically, the datasets
without the ERS and following the dominance response process were generated from the
SGRM with Equation 1 using R package mirt 1.33.2 (Chalmers, 2012). The datasets without
the ERS and following the unfolding response process were generated from the GGUM as
shown in Equation 3 using the R package GGUM 0.4.2 (Tendeiro & Castro-Alvarez, 2019).
The datasets with the ERS and following the dominance response process were generated from
the DIRTree model as shown in Equations 4-10 using customized functions. The datasets with
the ERS and following the unfolding response process were generated from the UIRTree model
as shown in Equations 5-11 using customized functions.
The SGRM and the GGUM had the focal trait 𝜃 following a standard normal
distribution 𝑁(0, 1) and discrimination parameters 𝛼 following a uniform distribution
𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓(0.5, 2). In the SGRM, the distance between any consecutive location parameters 𝛿
𝑖𝑘
followed a uniform distribution 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓(0.3, 1) and all location parameters were zero-centered.
Location parameters 𝛿 in the GGUM followed a truncated standard normal distribution
𝑁(0, 1) with −2 < 𝛿 < 2. As for threshold parameters in the GGUM, the R package GGUM
0.4.2 specified that 𝜏 = 0, and 𝜏 − 𝜏 were constrained to symmetry around zero, that is,
𝑖0 𝑖1 𝑖7
𝜏 = 0 and 𝜏 = −𝜏 for 𝑧 ≠ 0. In the DIRTree model and the UIRTree model, the focal
𝑖4 𝑖𝑧 𝑖(8−𝑧)
trait and the ERS followed a bivariate normal distribution, (𝜃 , 𝜁 ) ~𝐵𝑉𝑁(𝝁, 𝚺), where 𝝁 = 𝟎,

2 𝜃 𝑖
𝜎 𝜎 𝜌 𝜎
𝜃 𝜁 𝜃𝜁 𝜁
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 21
distribution 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓(0.5, 2). Location parameters 𝛿 in the DIRTree model followed a uniform
distribution 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓(−2, 2), and location parameters 𝛿 in the UIRTree model had the same
truncated standard normal distribution as that in the GGUM. Threshold parameters in the
UIRTree model distributed as 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓(−2, −0.5). Lastly, in the DIRTree model and the UIRTree
model, location parameters regarding the ERS, 𝛽 and 𝛽 , were uniformly distributed as
𝑖2 𝑖3
𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑓(−2, 2). Each generated dataset was then estimated with the SGRM, the GUMM, the
DIRTree model, and the UIRTree model to check the model fit and parameter recovery. The
number of items was fixed to 12 as it is a common length for personality measures (i.e., Brown
& Maydeu-Olivares, 2011; Cao et al., 2015; Soto & John, 2017).
Three factors, sample size (𝑁; with three levels: 300, 500, 1,000), the variance of ERS
(𝜎 ; with three levels: 0.2, 0.6, 1.0), and the correlation between the ERS and the focal trait
( 𝜌 ; with three levels: 0, 0.3, 0.6), were manipulated to check their influence on the
𝜃𝜁
performance of the estimation models. Since ERS was not involved in the datasets generated
from the SGRM and the GGUM, we only examined the sample size for these two types of
datasets. In total, there were three conditions of the datasets generated from the SGRM and the
GGUM, and 3 × 3 × 3=27 conditions of the datasets generated from the DIRTree model and
the UIRTree model. The number of replications in each condition was 100. All simulated data
sets were estimated by the R package mirt 1.33.2 (Chalmers, 2012) with the MMAP estimation
method as in the empirical study.
It is expected that as 𝑁 increases, the correctly specified model (i.e., the model that is
the same as the data generating model) and other models will have larger discrepancies
regarding model fit and parameter recovery. Larger discrepancies between the models that
account for ERS and the models that do not account for ERS are expected with the increase of
𝜎 . As for 𝜌 , Plieninger (2017) found that only when the correlation was non-zero could
𝜁 𝜃𝜁
models ignoring the ERS lead to substantial bias in the scale reliability, but the effects of the
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 22
correlation on model fit and parameter recovery were not studied. Accordingly, we looked into
these aspects in this simulation study.
Results
Even though previous studies documented a substantial proportion of non-convergence
when fitting the GGUM to data generated from the SGRM (e.g., Cao, Song, & Tay, 2018), we
note that all models, including those misspecified ones, converged properly in the present
study. This is likely due to the fact that we incorporated priors for the estimation GGUM, which
has been shown to be effective in reducing convergence issues and stabilizing estimates (de la
Torre, Stark, & Chernyshenko, 2006).
Power of AIC and BIC for model selection
The discrimination power (defined as the number of replications where the correctly
specified model had the lowest AIC/BIC divided by the total number of replications in each
to correctly distinguish the SGRM, the GGUM, and the DIRTree model across all conditions.
When the data generating model is the UIRTree model, however, AIC and BIC no longer had
perfect discrimination power as sometimes they wrongly preferred the DIRTree model.
As we can see, AIC consistently had very high discrimination power that was equal to
or extremely close to 1 when the sample size 𝑁 was 500 or 1000. When 𝑁 was as small as 300,
even though without perfect discrimination power, AIC still had the highest probability to
correctly select the UIRTree model over other models. Furthermore, when the ERS
variance⁡𝜎 was as sufficiently large as 1.0 (i.e., the same as the focal trait’s variance), a higher
𝜌 would lead to better discrimination power of AIC for the UIRTree model.
𝜃𝜁
The discrimination power of BIC for the UIRTree model was less satisfactory. In
conditions with 𝑁 = 300, BIC almost always wrongly preferred the DIRTree model over the
true UIRTree model. The poor discrimination power of BIC may result from the fact that more
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 23
parameters are estimated in the UIRTree model compared to the DIRTree model, and the
penalty of complexity was influential when the sample size⁡was small. As 𝑁 increased, the
discrimination power of BIC for the UIRTree model clearly improved. Besides, similar to AIC,
BIC tended to have higher power as the latent correlation 𝜌 increased when 𝜎 = 1. When
𝜃𝜁 𝜁
𝑁, 𝜌 , and 𝜎 were sufficiently large (in this simulation study, when 𝑁 = 1000, 𝜌 = 0.6,
𝜃𝜁 𝜁 𝜃𝜁
and 𝜎 = 1), the discrimination power of BIC approached as high as 0.93.

Parameter recovery
Parameter recovery was investigated based on mean bias (the mean of parameter
estimates minus parameter true values), mean absolute bias (the mean of the absolute values of
parameter estimates minus parameter true values), and root mean square error (RMSE; the
square root of mean squared error of each parameter). The three indices were calculated for
each parameter and then averaged across items. We focused on four aspects here. First, we
examined whether model parameters could be accurately recovered when the correctly
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 24
specified model was fitted to the data. Second, we examined parameter recovery of the SGRM
and the GGUM when the data was generated from the DIRTree model and the UIRTree model,
respectively. Third, we also examined item parameter recovery of the DIRTree model and the
UIRTree model for datasets generated from the SGRM and the GGUM, respectively. Fourth,
we looked into parameter recovery of the DIRTree model for datasets generated from the
UIRTree model.
When the fitted model was correctly specified
The most important finding was that parameters for correctly specified UIRTree models
5). Item parameters for correctly specified DIRTree models could also be estimated accurately
across conditions. As expected, parameters for the SGRM and the GGUM were all accurately
recovered as well even in conditions with only 300 respondents.

Note. The means and SDs of parameter recovery indices were computed across all conditions.
When the ERS was ignored
It was found in the empirical study that discrimination parameters on the focal trait, α,
had smaller values in the GGUM compared to the UIRTree model and in the SGRM compared
to the DIRTree model. This pattern was also observed in this simulation study. For datasets
generated from the UIRTree model (the DIRTree model), estimates of α from the GGUM (the
SGRM) had mean bias ranging from -0.70 to -0.61 (from -0.45 to -0.39), mean absolute bias
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 26
ranging from 0.61 to 0.70 (from 0.41 to 0.45), and RMSE ranging from 0.66 to 0.76 (from 0.46
to 0.52). The negative mean bias suggested that ignoring response ERS led to underestimated
the discrimination ability of items. Furthermore, the finding that the sizes of mean bias and
mean absolute bias were similar suggested that the underestimation occurred in almost all
replications. No clear effects of 𝑁, 𝜎 , and 𝜌 on the bias of α were found.
𝜁 𝜃𝜁
In line with the empirical findings, estimates of location parameters regarding the focal
trait, δ , had more extreme values in the GGUM compared to the UIRTree model for

generated from the UIRTree model. When the ERS and the focal trait were uncorrelated (i.e.,

value of 𝜎 ; when the ERS and the focal trait were correlated (i.e., 𝜌 ≠ 0), the parameter
𝜁 𝜃𝜁
recovery of δ in the GGUM became clearly worse and increased with larger 𝜎 . The increase
of 𝑁 seemed to have no influence on the mean bias of δ while it did decrease its mean absolute
bias and the RMSE. Results from linear regression analysis also revealed a significant

𝜁 𝜃𝜁
a significantly negative main effect of 𝑁 on mean absolute bias and RMSE of δ.

UIRTree model
When the ERS was falsely assumed
When the dataset was generated from the GGUM, the discrimination parameters of the
UIRTree model had mean bias of 0.62, 0.82, and 0.92, mean absolute bias of 0.62, 0.82, and
0.92, and RMSE of 0.65, 0.87, and 0.96 in conditions with sample size 𝑁 equal to 300, 500,
and 1000, respectively, indicating that the UIRTree model consistently overestimated 𝛼 .
Moreover, the absence of the ERS did not distort the estimation of 𝛿 in the UIRTree model
substantially, with mean bias of 0.07, -0.05, and 0.01, mean absolute bias of 0.14, 0.09, and
0.05, and RMSE of 0.18, 0.10, and 0.07. For datasets generated from the SGRM, the DIRTree
model brought about mean bias of 0.03, 0.02, and 0.004, mean absolute bias of 0.20, 0.15, and
0.10, and RMSE of 0.26, 0.19, and 0.13 for 𝛼, suggesting that falsely assuming the ERS would
not substantially impact the estimation of discrimination parameters on the focal trait.
When the dominance response process was falsely assumed
Lastly, we investigated parameter recovery of the DIRTree model for datasets generated
from the UIRTree model. The common parameters of the two models were the variance of the
ERS 𝜎 , location parameters regarding the ERS 𝛽 and 𝛽 , and the latent correlation between
𝜁 2 3
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 28
the ERS and the focal trait 𝜌 . Since the nodes for the ERS were coded and modeled the same
𝜃𝜁
for the two IRTree models, the parameter recovery of 𝜎 , 𝛽 , and 𝛽 of the DIRTree model,
𝜁 2 3
as expected, were satisfactory with mean bias ranging from -0.01 to 0.01, mean absolute bias
ranging from 0.02 to 0.20, and RMSE ranging from 0.02 to 0.24. These parameter recovery
indices were close to those of the UIRTree model. Surprisingly. 𝜌 was sufficiently accurately
𝜃𝜁
estimated such that the mean bias ranged from -0.11 to 0.11, the mean absolute bias ranged
from 0.04 to 0.17, and the RMSE ranged from 0.04 to 0.17 in the DIRTree model.
General Discussion
Correctly accounting for item response process and RSs are of fundamental importance
in psychological measurement. However, previous research on item response process and RSs
has been growing largely in parallel. The present study aimed to integrate the unfolding
response process and RSs in a single modeling framework by proposing the UIRTree model.
The empirical illustration showed that respondents were likely to have followed an unfolding
response process, and the ERS had a strong presence. Monte Carlo simulations further showed
that (1) model parameters in the UIRTree model could be accurately recovered under realistic
conditions, (2) AIC was very powerful in selecting among competing models, (3) BIC was
biased towards the DIRTree model (i.e., the simpler model) versus the UIRTree model in
conditions with relatively small sample size, small ERS magnitude, and/or low correlation
between the focal trait and the ERS, and (4) wrongly assuming the item response process or
ignoring RSs was detrimental to the estimation of key parameters. Overall, the current study
presented a flexible framework that is expected to help researchers better reveal how
respondents respond to non-cognitive items.
Model Selection
We investigated the power of AIC and BIC to select among competing models and
found that AIC was very effective in the absolute sense while BIC was biased towards the
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 29
DIRTree model when the correctly specified model was the UIRTree model. This finding is
very important in that it tells us to have more confidence in AIC instead of BIC when choosing
between the DIRTree and UIRTree models. We suspect that BIC’s heavy penality for model
complexity is the reason for the weaker power of BIC compared to AIC. Compared with the
DIRTree model, the UIRTree model has two more parameters per item. In the current
simulation, the fitted UIRTree model had 24 more parameters than the DIRTree model.
However, the item response curve of a dominance model can overlap with a substantial
Tay et al., 2011). The further away an item is from zero, the more overlap. Therefore, the
degree of model-data misfit might not be as dramatic as we would expect because item
locations spanned from -2 to 2. The moderate degree of misfit might be countered by BIC’s
penalty for the 24 additional parameters, thus leading to the low power of BIC.
Parameter recovery for the UIRTree model
It is reassuring to see that key parameters in the UIRTree model can be well recovered
even in conditions with only 300 respondents. Earlier studies on the estimation of the GGUM
showed that a sample size of 750 would be a requirement for reasonably accurate estimates
when a marginal maximum likelihood estimator was used (Roberts et al., 2000). Otherwise,
researchers are likely to obtain some wild estimates (de la Torre et al., 2006). In the current
study, moderately informative priors were used for discrimination parameters and location
parameters to softly constrain them parameters within a reasonable range. Our simulation
showed that the incorporation of priors into the estimation process greatly reduced sample size
requirement. Future users of the UIRTree model (or GGUM) are strongly encouraged to use
such priors for more stable and accurate estimates.
Implications
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 30
This study has both theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, we proposed
an integrative modeling framework that can simultaneously account for the unfolding response
process and RSs. This modeling framework has the potential to help researchers better
understand the cognitive processes underlying item responding, which is critical for
measurement validity (Borsboom et al., 2004). Practically, the UIRTree model may be helpful
for scale development. It is known that writing intermediate items is difficult because a
seemingly good item often turns out to have lower discrimination parameters or more extreme
location parameters than expected when analyzed with the GGUM. Our simulation results
showed that low discrimination parameters or more extreme location parameters might result
from unmodeled ERS. Of course, it should be noted that falsely assuming ERS will lead to
overestimated discrimination parameters (but location parameters were not biased). Therefore,
for scales that include intermediate items or where intermediate are suspected to exist,
researchers should first fit the GGUM and the UIRTree model, use AIC to compare model fit,
and then check the magnitude of the ERS. If AIC selects the GGUM and the magnitude of the
ERS is small, then results from the GGUM are more trustworthy. If AIC prefers the UIRTree
and the magnitude of the ERS is substantial, researchers should trust results from the UIRTree
model more. Moreover, this study also provides tutorials for estimating the UIRTree model,
which allows the model to be more accessible for practitioners.
Limitation and future directions
Despite the merits discussed above, the current study is still limited in the following
aspects. First, the UIRTree model proposed here only accounted for a single focal trait. Future
researchers are encouraged to extend the current one to a multi-trait UIRTree model. One
additional advantage of that multi-trait UIRTree model is that we could formally test whether
a certain type of RS is generalizable across constructs or not (Zhang, Luo et al., 2021). However,
caution should be exercised in model estimation since traditional estimation methods for item
UNFOLDING ITEM RESPONSE TREE MODEL 31
response models usually have trouble handling high-dimensional structures (Wirth & Edwards,
2007). Second, the current model implicitly assumes population heterogeneity such that the
same model applies to everyone. However, studies suggested that different people may follow
different item response processes, and some people may not engage in extreme responding
while others do (Tijmstra, Bolsinova, & Jeon, 2018). Therefore, future researchers could
develop some mixture models to account for such population heterogeneity. Third, other types
of RSs apart from the ERS were not examined. Given the flexibility of the UIRTree model,
future researchers are encouraged to extend the current version to include more than one type
of RSs.
Conclusion
With evidence from both the empirical illustration and the simulation study, the
proposed UIRTree model shows potential in estimating responses with unfolding response
processes and influenced by RSs. Incorrectly specifying response process or ignoring RSs is
likely to cause estimation bias and thus distort measurement and item selection procedures.
Researchers are encouraged to consider the UIRTree model when modeling Likert-scale
responses.
