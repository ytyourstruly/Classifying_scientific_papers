Pain in Contact Sports
ABSTRACT
62 Contact sports athletes are regularly facing acute physical pain in part of their sport. However,
63 the literature investigating pain perception in these athletes remains scarce. This scoping review
64 aimed to explore the literature surrounding pain perception in contact sport athletes and to compile
65 and understand how it is studied. The search strategy consisted of using index terms and keywords
66 in Medline, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL and ProQuest
67 Dissertations & Theses Global search engines. Results from 11 studies revealed that a mix of team
68 contact sports and combat sports are studied and included under the umbrella of contact sports.
69 These athletes are being compared to non-athletes as well as athletes from non-contact sports. The
70 cold pressor test and the pain pressure test are the two predominant methods used to investigate
71 physical pain. This review highlights the need to clearly define sports based on contact levels
72 expected in play to better define the types of pain athletes are facing in their practice. Athlete’s
73 level of play as well as years of experience should also be more rigorously reported. While contact
74 sport athletes seem to have a higher level of pain tolerance than both active controls and non-
75 contact athletes, the methods of pain testing are not always justified and appropriate in relation to
76 the pain induced during contact sports. Future experimental studies should use pain testing
77 methods relevant to the pain experienced during contact sports and better justify the rationale for
78 the choice of these methods.

91 consider when investigating contact sports.
Pain in Contact Sports
1 INTRODUCTION
93 Pain is “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that
94 associated with, actual or potential tissue damage” [1] and serves as an alarm for avoiding such
95 damage. The primary purpose of that warning in sport is to caution against possible harm such as
96 injury or overwork [2]. Sport participation can however encourage athletes to push past those
97 signals in pursuit of performance goals [2]. Pain can interfere with athletes’ motor control,
98 endurance, and cognitive performance, making it an important component of training or
99 competition outcomes [3, 4]. It, therefore, stands that the relationship between athletes and pain is
100 complex.
101 Not all painful stimuli encountered by athletes are the same. Pain can develop naturally in the
102 muscle with repeated or continuous contractions [5], a sensation often alluded to with training
103 slogans such as “no pain, no gain” [6]. This exercise-induced muscle pain, also referred to as
104 naturally occurring muscle pain during exercise [5], is likely caused by a combination of increased
105 internal pressure, tissue deformation during contraction and the accumulation of noxious
106 metabolites [7]. Nociceptors (afferent type III and IV fibres or Aδ and C respectively) respond
107 differently to these stimuli with a subset of type IV responding preferentially to muscle contraction
108 under ischaemic conditions, and both fibre types responding to metabolites [7]. Those in a sport
109 where contact is encouraged or required, however, face the additional challenge of having to
110 endure harm purposely done to them by other players. This can represent an additional external
111 mechanical stimulus and would trigger pain pathways associated with skin and muscle
112 deformation, associated or not with tissue damage, rather than those originating naturally in the
113 muscle during exercise. The combination of these experiences result in the overall perception of
114 pain [7]. While an exact ethical and objective methodology to replicate the pain from contact sport
115 does not exist, the literature in pain research provides several testing methods that could be used
116 to explore pain perception in contact sport.
117 Pain exists on a spectrum that can be characterized as a function of stimulus intensity and can
118 be investigated from pain threshold to pain tolerance. [8]. The pain threshold is widely defined as
119 the point at which that sensation becomes painful to the participant, and pain tolerance is the
120 maximum intensity of a pain-producing stimulus that a subject is willing to accept in a given
121 situation [8]. Pain threshold and pain tolerance can be investigated via different ways of inducing
Pain in Contact Sports
122 pain experimentally. The pain pressure test, for instance, relies on increasing mechanical pressure
123 applied externally over a body part [9]. Thermal pain can be induced in two ways, either by using
124 a cold or hot temperature. The cold pressor test requires that the participant immerse a limb in cold
125 water until they are no longer able to withstand the pain [10]. Alternatively, cutaneous heat can be
126 applied similarly by immersing a limb in water or using radiant/laser heat sources or contact probes
127 [7]. Transcutaneous electric stimulation can also be applied to induce pain [7]. On top of external
128 methods applied on the skin, several options are available to induce pain within muscles. This can
129 be induced by the application of topical stimuli or injection within the muscles known to stimulate
130 muscle nociceptors or by the completion of physical exercise. In the context of the application of
131 external stimuli, muscle ischemia involves interrupting blood flow using a cuff to induce local
132 hypoxia and reduce clearance [11]. This method will stimulate the muscle nociceptors by trapping
133 the metabolites within the muscles as well as by the application of mechanical pressure on the skin
134 and the muscle where the cuff is located [12]. A more invasive method consists of the injection
135 of noxious chemicals such as hypertonic saline or a mix of exercise-produced metabolites within
136 a muscle to simulate claudication [7] as well as metabolite buildup [13]. In the context of muscle
137 pain induced by physical exercise, naturally occurring muscle pain [14] and delayed onset muscle
138 soreness (DOMS) are two methods used for the investigation of pain. Naturally occurring muscle
139 pain during exercise occurs during aerobic exercise at an intensity and duration that creates an
140 accumulation of metabolites within the muscles known to stimulate the nociceptors, such as
141 bradykinin or hydrogen ions [5]. Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) can be induced through
142 exercise, causing muscle damage to create a painful condition that peaks 48h after completion
143 [15].
144 As athletes progress in training and experience, they seem to be able to tolerate more pain than
145 their non-trained counterparts. A review by Tesarz et al. [16] looked at different measurements of
146 pain, both naturally occurring and externally occurring, to compare athletes to non-athletes and
147 found that overall, athletes have a higher pain tolerance than normally active controls. They did
148 not, however, make a distinction between different types of athletes in accordance with the nature
149 of pain of their sport (e.g., endurance vs contact sport). More recent studies extended these results
150 by demonstrating differences in pain perception between endurance and strength athletes [17], as
151 well as triathletes and non-athlete participants [18]. Contact sport athletes differ from others in that
152 they must accept opponents making physical contact with them as part of engagement in the game.
Pain in Contact Sports
153 Team sports that fall under that category, such as rugby, have certain rules against excessive
154 physical harm, but some roughness is to be expected, and can in fact be encouraged [19]. Combat
155 sports not only have this expectation but require regulated aggressive, pain-inducing actions to win
156 [20]. Pain during combat sports is caused primarily by external mechanical stimuli applied to the
157 body. It is therefore likely possible that the pain experienced by contact sport athletes is different
158 than the pain experienced by non-contact sport athletes, such as endurance athletes, who are
159 predominantly facing pain induced by metabolic stimuli resulting from muscle contraction-
160 induced metabolic accumulation within the muscle milieu. In this context, studying pain in contact
161 sport as separate is necessary given the difference in pain profiles with other types of sport.
162 This scoping review aims to explore whether contact sport athletes perceive pain differently,
163 paving the way for future research to test whether natural ability or specific athletic training can
164 influence pain processing. It will explore how pain experienced during contact sport is researched
165 through four research questions. It will investigate i) what sports are being studied as well as ii)
166 the expertise level of the athletes. Alongside the athletes in question, iii) the types of control groups
167 being used will also be examined. Finally, iv) the methodology used to induce pain will be
168 scrutinized. While some methods of inducing pain may be more practical, or accessible in a
169 laboratory-controlled environment, not all may be appropriate when testing people with specific
170 sports training if the goal is to generalize to the sport experience.

2 METHODS
2.1 Search Strategy
174 A librarian (DA) captained the database searches based on those used by Tesarz et al. [14], in
175 collaboration with AOF. The search strategy consisted of using index terms and keywords in
176 Medline, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL and ProQuest
177 Dissertations & Theses Global search engines. The terms “contact sport”, and “pain” were initially
178 used to parse out studies where pain testing was done with the athletes of interest. The detailed
179 equation search for MEDLINE is available in Supplementary Material 1. The search in the
180 database was performed on the 26th of April 2021. Covidence software (Veritas Health Innovation)
181 was used to perform article screening in three steps: removing some duplicates, titles and abstracts,
182 and full texts. Two researchers (AOF and WS) agreed on inclusion at each step of the article
183 screening. In the event of a disagreement, a discussion with a third researcher (BP) determined
184 final inclusion. The initial literature search revealed 699 potential studies of interest, and the
185 screening process led to the inclusion of 9 articles. From later exploration of the “cited by” feature
186 of Google Scholar, a tenth and eleventh relevant article were identified and included. The
187 reference list of all included papers was also screened for additional sources. A detailed flowchart
Pain in Contact Sports
2.2 Inclusion criteria
196 Publications in both French and English were included regardless of publication year. The
197 inclusion of contact sport athletes was the first criterion. Contact sports are defined as any sport
198 where regulated contact with opponents is necessary for play [17] and as such were determined to
199 include combat sports and team sports such as American Football, lacrosse, rugby, roller derby,
200 and hurling. Any additional sport was judged based on whether contact between players is
201 encouraged or is considered part of the game. For example, contact is part of soccer, but not
202 encouraged as a tactical play method. Martial artists were included if their discipline involved

203 physical contact, therefore excluding meditative arts such as tai chi. Controls were either athletes
204 in non-contact disciplines such as tennis, or non-specifically active individuals.
205 Included studies had to measure pain threshold, tolerance, both, or a continuum from one to the
206 other. Articles using these methods were included as well as reviews including such articles.
207 Comparing pain perception can be done primarily using two different parameters, pain threshold
208 and pain tolerance. Pain threshold is the minimal stimulus necessary perceived by a subject as
209 painful. Tolerance is the upper limit of painful stimulus that a subject is willing or capable of
210 enduring. Both were analyzed to get a better understanding of pain as a multifaceted experience.
211 In some cases, a visual analog scale was used to monitor the pain intensity from the threshold to
212 the point of maximum tolerance. Methods of pain testing had to be validated to be included and so
213 studies using pain pressure test, cold pressor test, electric shock, heat pain, delayed onset muscle
214 soreness, naturally occurring muscle pain during exercise, and ischaemic pain were retained.
2.3 Data extraction
219 WS with two articles. Few disagreements were observed, and the three authors updated the data
221 Data extraction was subsequently performed by AOF and WS, and standardization of the
223 material 3). Briefly, for the eleven included articles, the following information was obtained:
224 reference of the article, details of the contact sport and control group, pain tests performed, and
225 other pain-related measurements collected.
Pain in Contact Sports
3 RESULTS:
229 3.1 Studies included
230 To the best of our knowledge, no review focusing on pain in contact sports has been written.
231 Eleven articles were retained for data extraction from the initial 699, all from peer-reviewed
232 journals. Despite searching articles in French and English, all articles retained were in English.
233 Included articles originated from the USA (n = 4), the UK (n = 3), and Poland (n = 4). There was
234 very little overlap between authors from the USA except in the early publications where Ryan
235 appears in both. Two authors from the UK appeared in all three UK-based papers, another author
236 appeared in two. Among the Polish teams, the same first author appears in three of four papers.
237 This fact highlights how few researchers are currently working on pain in contact sports. Both
238 articles written in the 60s were first authored by the same researcher. A timeline of articles
244 Pain perception in contact sports was first studied in the late 1960s [21, 22]. Literature
245 contributing to the topic then ceased being produced until the year 2000 only to ramp up after
246 2010. The relative density of contributing articles has increased in recent years with eight articles
247 being published in the last ten years.

259 3.3 Groups compared to contact sport athletes
260 Contact sport athletes were compared to either untrained individuals or fellow athletes trained
262 general levels of physical activity were unclear. In the case of Leźnicka et al. [25-27], the control
263 group was identified as students from the “Physical Culture” department of the university, and no
264 additional information was offered to determine if these students were otherwise active or inactive
265 despite being classified as untrained individuals. In the case of Hawrylak et al. [17], students were
266 also used as a control group, but similarly, no precision was given about the level of physical
267 activity. Sheffield et al. [24] has both types of controls, trained individuals, and untrained
268 individuals. Trained individuals were picked from netball, volleyball, soccer, basketball, track,
269 swimming, and cricket. In no case was a distinction made for low contact team sports such as
270 basketball differing from no contact individual sports such as swimming.

298 Contact sport athletes, while having similar results in pain tolerance to the pain pressure test, seem
299 to have a similar threshold to cold pain than their counterparts.
301 athletes started out with higher pain tolerance than their counterparts, but that the difference in
302 tolerance increased over time and with added experience (here over 8 months) [28]. Additionally,

304 better tolerance than non-athletes [21].

313 3.5 Motor and cognitive performance in presence of experimentally induced pain
314 Motor performance tests [9, 29] were performed simultaneously with the pain condition in two
315 studies to assess the interfering effects of pain. In both cases, the task required participants to throw
316 a tennis ball at numbered targets in a given order. Participants were scored based on their accuracy
317 and speed in completing the task. In Sheffield et al. [8], two conditions were used. In one, the
318 participants had ten targets that they had to hit in numerical order, moving on to the next number
319 regardless of whether they hit the target or not. In the more difficult condition, ten additional targets
320 were added that displayed letters or symbols that had to be disregarded. In Thornton et al. [24], 20
321 targets were given, and participants were required to hit the one indicated by researchers
322 immediately before the attempt. A total of ten targets were given, and as with Sheffield et al. [8],
323 the participant moved on regardless of having hit the target or not. The grading was also based on
324 time and accuracy.
325 In both studies, contact sport athletes differed from control groups. In Sheffield et al. [8], high
326 contact athletes’ motor performance (both in time and accuracy) was not altered by the pain
327 condition while the low-contact athletes and non-athletes performed significantly worse in the
328 presence of pain. In Thornton et al. [24], experienced contact sport athletes not only maintained
329 their motor performance in the pain condition but hit the targets faster than in the non-pain
330 condition. Novice contact athletes maintained their performance in both speed and accuracy. Non-
331 contact athletes performed significantly worse in both testing parameters when in the pain
332 condition.
333 Sheffield et al. [8] also had participants perform a cognitive task in both a pain and non-pain
334 condition. The task required participants to check off numbers appearing randomly on a grid in the
335 correct order using pen and paper. The grid contained the numbers one to twenty-five in random
336 order. Performance was assessed using the time taken to complete the task. The difficulty was
337 increased by adding 25 additional numbers that were to be ignored. The pain condition did not
338 alter the performance of the groups regardless of sport expertise.

4 DISCUSSION
340 This scoping review presents an overview of the literature on pain perception in contact sports.
341 It identifies the types of sports being considered when studying contact sports, the groups they are
342 being compared to, and the various methods used to study pain in those populations. Eleven studies
343 were included, and the literature search did not reveal any reviews focusing on contact sports. The
344 main outcomes of this scoping review were i) an assortment of contact sports was considered
345 across team sports and combat sports; ii) these groups were compared to both non-athletes and
346 non-contact sport athletes; iii) of all available pain testing methods, four were used, two of which
347 may be inappropriate for studying the pain experienced by contact sport athletes in their sport.
349 4.1 What contact sports are being studied?
350 The first research question sought to determine which contact sports were being studied. A mix
351 of team sports and combat sports is represented. In two articles, [19, 24] the list of participants’
352 sport affiliations includes “martial arts” with no additional information on the type, expertise level,
353 or contact expected in the sport. As an example, tai chi is a martial art that could technically fall
354 under that umbrella, but it is a meditative discipline where no contact is made as is qigong and
355 non-competitive capoeira [30]. Their inclusion as martial arts can therefore be misleading and
356 introduce population heterogeneity when it comes to pain experience. Similarly, the expertise of
357 participants in contact sports is not thoroughly described in all included studies. Specifying the
358 level of expertise of combat sport athletes as well as their number of years of training is crucial as
359 it conditions the existence and/or intensity of the contact during the activity. To illustrate, it is
360 possible to train in karate without contact while still being considered a martial artist and contact
361 sport athlete. This would be the case for a kata specialist, where performance involves precise
362 movement, but no contact with another karateka [31].
363 Another challenge with the contact sport groups is the mix of team and combat sport within the
364 same group. It remains difficult to ensure that the level of expertise is similar across dissimilar
365 gameplay requirements [28, 29]. For example, it is not possible to reliably claim that a certain belt
366 in karate is equivalent to a certain level of American Football. Each sport has demands and
367 classifications systems that do not necessarily overlap, and consequently, the quantity and intensity
368 of contact during sport can widely differ between team and combat sports. For instance, light (e.g.,
Pain in Contact Sports
369 knock-out forbidden but continuous actions allowed), semi (e.g., fight stopped at each effective
370 striking scoring a point) and full (e.g., knock-out allowed) contact combat sports regulations
371 indicate different fighting rhythms resulting in distinct contact intensities, still difficult to quantify
372 in practice. Therefore, being able to quantify during practice the quantity and intensity of contact
373 could help to better classify each sport. Quantifying any striking on a mobile target, which is a
374 source of contact absorption, is hard to standardise as most impact sensor devices traditionally rely
375 on gold standard sensing systems such as force plates [32]. Recent advances in wearable
376 technologies, such as accelerometers attached to limbs or connected to punching bags/pads [33,
377 34], may offer interesting opportunities for better evaluation of contact quantity and intensity in
378 each sport. To move forward, future research should focus on the standardized use of impact sensor
379 tools to produce normative data for each sport regarding their contact quantity and intensity. It
380 appears crucial that future studies adopt a more precise and thorough description of contact sports
381 athletes by providing clear information on sport type and expertise level. Also, due to the different
382 nature between combat sports and team sports, a distinction should be made when pooling
383 participants from both types. We do however keep in mind that such dissociation between combat
384 and team sports could lead to more difficulties in reaching an important sample size depending on
385 the sports clubs existing around the research group performing the studies.
388 4.2 To whom are contact sport athletes being compared?
389 The participants included in control groups across the studies varied in level of physical activity.
390 In all cases, those identified as non-athletes were students, and their level of activity was generally
391 unclear or unspecified. This would be important to note since we can refer to Thornton et al. [23]
392 where pain perception changed over months of exposure to contact sports. The literature also
393 suggests that sport practice could alter pain perception regardless of the discipline of contact sport
394 [35]. A thorough description of the history of exposure to contact sport as well as other sports is
395 necessary when comparing pain perception between sport expertise or across physical activity
396 levels in future studies.
397 As previously mentioned, an identification system detailing the level of contact of each sport
398 should exist to properly classify athlete control groups. For instance, in Sheffield et al. [24], the
399 no contact group was represented by students while the “low-contact group” was comprised of
Pain in Contact Sports
400 normally active individuals, tennis players, badminton players, and trampolinists. In none of those
401 sports is contact either required or expected for adequate play. The classification of these sports as
402 “low-contact sports” is confusing as the nature of this sport and their rules do not involve contact.
403 Furthermore, as contact sport involves contact with opponents, these sports could not be
404 considered as low contact as the separation between the opponent with a net prevents any contact
405 with the opponent. It appears more appropriate to classify these sports as no-contact sports and to
406 classify team sports such as basketball or soccer as low contact sports. Indeed, in these two sports,
407 while contact between opponents is not predominant, the tactical aspects of the sports require few
408 contacts, such as shoulder to shoulder in soccer or performing a pick and roll in basketball. A more
409 rigorous classification of the control group would therefore be beneficial in future research to truly
410 understand how practitioners of different sports can vary in their pain modulation.
413 4.3 Proposed definitions for studying contact sports
414 As presented in the previous section, there are inconsistencies in the categorisation of the
415 contact sports included in the studies presented in this scoping review. These inconsistencies are
416 apparent in terms of the categorisation of whether a sport is a contact sport or not, as well as in
417 terms of the categorisation of sports according to contact level. This scoping review is therefore
418 an opportunity to provide some clarifications to help conceptualize the notion of (non-)contact
419 sport and low/high-contact sport. To do so, this section will provide brief information on the nature
420 of the contact needed to allow a sport to be categorize as a contact sport, and then offer some
421 definitions.
422 It is important to clarify that to be categorized as a contact sport, a sport must include contact
423 between at least two opponents. This important detail is explicit in the Collins and Oxford
424 dictionaries where contact sports are defined as “a sport that involves physical contact between
425 participants” and “a sport in which the participants necessarily come into bodily contact with one
426 another”, respectively. While some may argue that a certain level of contact may exist in other
427 sports due to the contact with the ground when jumping or running, or the contact with a compliant
428 surface when practicing trampoline for example, we believe that the inclusion of sports including
429 such contact as contact sport is not appropriate. One of the best illustrations may be a marathon
430 runner. During 26.2 miles, a marathon runner will face a contact between her/his foot and the road
Pain in Contact Sports
431 at each step. However, marathon, as other endurance sports such as trail running, or other long-
432 distance events are classified as endurance sports due to the nature of the sports not involving
433 contacts between opponents. In this context we propose the definitions below:
434 - No contact sports: Any sports in which the nature of existing contacts is not between
435 opponents.
436 - Contact sports: Any sports involving contacts with at least one opponent, and where
437 contacts are regulated by the rules. Contact sports include most of the combat sports and
438 specific team sports.
439 Special attention should be given to “martial arts” as some disciplines do not involve
440 contact (e.g., tai chi or qigong), and the level of expertise and years of training may
441 condition the existence or not of contact (e.g., non-competitive capoeira or kata specialist).
442 - Low contact sports: Any sports in which contacts with opponents may occur but are not
443 essential for play. These contacts are a minor part of the sport and are not extensively
444 encouraged. Such sport may include for example basketball or soccer.
445 - High contact sports: Any sports in which contacts with opponents are encouraged and
446 essential for play. These contacts are a major part of the sport and are extensively
447 encouraged, albeit compulsory to reach the victory during a game. Such sport may include
448 for example rugby or boxing.
451 4.4 What methods of pain testing are being used?
452 Among the available methods existing to study pain in an experimental setting, four were used
453 in the studies included in this scoping review: pain pressure test, cold pressor test, ischaemic pain,
454 and heat pain. The use of the pain pressure test and the cold pressor test dominated within the
455 included studies. When studying pain in contact sports, some methods of testing are less
456 appropriate given that they are not normally encountered in training or competition context (e.g.,
457 thermal pain, whether heat or cold, is not typically a painful condition of boxing or rugby). It is
458 however important to note that certain athletes use ice baths for therapeutic or recovery purposes
459 [36], and may therefore be more habituated to the cold feeling or interpret it as healing rather than
460 painful. Indeed, it is known that expectation can modulate pain [37]. It would be necessary to ask
461 athletes about their history with this method if using it to induce pain in future studies.
Pain in Contact Sports
462 In pain research, certain safeguards are put into place to avoid causing damage to participants.
463 For this reason, the cold pressor test has an upper time limit. This limit is usually not communicated
464 to the participant to avoid creating a target [27]. This can however limit results when it comes to
465 measuring the tolerance of individuals who frequently experience high levels of pain. An
466 individual in a control group and a contact sport group can therefore both have a ceiling effect
467 despite one being able to continue and the other not. It is a crucial limitation to testing that must
468 be considered in the development of further studies.
469 The source of pain in a combat sport is clear, it is predominately due to mechanical contact with
470 the opponent, however, the pain profile of team sports may have another component, naturally
471 occurring muscle pain that comes with prolonged muscle use. Interestingly, none of the included
472 studies considered the investigation of naturally occurring muscle pain during exercise. This would
473 imply that the choice of the type of pain being induced does not take into consideration possible
474 habituation by a contact sport athlete. The expertise, and therefore possible adaptation, provided
475 by training is not cited as a determining factor. It would therefore be of interest to test this type of
476 pain with other sports to better understand specific pain type modulation required in different
477 sports. Examples include studying naturally occurring muscle pain during exercise in endurance
478 athletes, or further differentiating pain profiles of team contact sports and combat sports.
479 Additionally, since each athletic pursuit focuses on different aspects of performance (intensity,
480 time, continuity of movement), the muscle pain involved and investigated should have a specific
481 profile based on the sport’s parameters.
483 4.5 What are the conclusions of the included studies in pain perception in contact sports?
484 While our scoping review did not aim to perform a meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity in
485 athletes, control groups and pain testing methods in the literature, it remains possible to discuss
486 the outcomes of these studies as presented by the authors. Regarding differences in pain
487 perception, the retained articles measurements of pain threshold, tolerance and intensity were
488 taken. When it comes to measuring threshold, all studies using the same method found similar
489 outcomes for threshold. When using mechanical pain, contact sport athletes were reported to have
490 a higher threshold, consistent with a decreased pain sensitivity. Studies using cold, however, stated
491 that the pain threshold of all groups was similar. This similarity in pain threshold between the
492 different groups is not intuitively surprising as contact sport athletes are not facing cold pain in
Pain in Contact Sports
493 their practice, and therefore habituation to this specific painful stimulus is most likely not
494 developed, except in the possible case mentioned earlier concerning ice baths. This highlights the
495 possibility that the choice of testing method is crucial when studying contact sport athletes, and
496 that sport expertise could develop pain experience differences that are specific to the nature of the
497 sport performed (e.g., no contact sport athletes are regularly facing painful cold, but do face
498 mechanical pain regularly)
499 As discussed in the review by Tesarz et al. [14], athletes have a higher pain tolerance than non-
500 athletes. Further distinction between groups of athletes suggests that they are not homogeneous
501 and differ according to the type of sport. Evidence that tolerance differs across contact categories
502 is consistent throughout all methods tested (pressure, cold, ischemia). Collectively, the results of
503 the retained studies would imply that participation in a contact sport is associated with higher pain
504 tolerance, independent of the pain modality and possibly explained by improved self-regulation of
505 pain. Further study is obviously necessary.
506 Pain intensity was reported in three studies [9, 24, 29]. Across the cold pressor test and pain
507 pressure test, it was reported that contact sport athletes signal lower pain intensity ratings
508 throughout testing than their counterparts. This result also suggests a generalized hyposensitivity
509 that may reflect a non-specific reduction in pain processing or improved pain-regulation. Future
510 studies should test this observation with naturally occurring muscle pain during exercise and
511 muscle ischemia, two kinds of pain more closely related to sport practice than cold pain.
512 While cognitive and motor performance in a pain condition was only included in two studies,
513 it would seem like a promising avenue for future research. Maintenance of motor performance in
514 contact sport athletes would imply an ability to endure pain when faced with a physical task and
515 to overcome the interfering effect on motor activity [38, 39] This possibility is supported by the
516 results of Sheffield et al. [8] and Thornton et al. [24]. Cognitively, Sheffield et al. [24] observed
517 that pain did not alter performance and could perhaps be explained by the far more relatable
518 experience of ignoring pain during day-to-day cognitive tasks. Another explanation would be
519 because the negative effect of pain on cognitive performance solely appears in the context of highly
520 demanding cognitive tasks [40]. Future studies interested in the effects of pain on cognitive
521 performance in contact sport athletes should consider modulating the task difficulty to further
522 explore this possibility. Due to the scarce investigation on the effects of pain on cognitive and
Pain in Contact Sports
523 motor performance in contact sport athletes, future studies are required to a clear conclusion on
524 the effects of pain on performance in this specific population.
5 CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES
529 When testing pain in contact sport athletes, a heterogeneous spread of both team and combat
530 sports are considered. These athletes are compared to non-athletes or athletes trained in non-
531 contact sports. Pain perception is predominantly tested using the pain pressure test, the cold pressor
532 test, and with ischaemic pain. Naturally occurring muscle pain during exercise being experienced
533 by contact sport athletes, albeit predominantly in team sports, differences between athletes in this
534 specific kind of pain should be considered in future studies. Similarly, DOMS being associated
535 with the experience of muscle pain, and athletes sometimes train or compete in the presence of
536 DOMS, future studies should investigate how the pain experienced in the presence of DOMS could
537 impact contact sport athletes.
538 More generally, the specificity of the observed differences in a given pain modality should be
539 assessed using within-subject designs including quantitative sensory testing across multiple pain
540 modalities (e.g.[41, 42]).
541 Further research should consider a more thorough definition of contact sports in opposition to
542 low, or no contact. It should also consider the nature of the pain that sports being tested require
543 athletes to endure to better understand how pain perception can differ in contact sport athletes.
544 Pain threshold and tolerance should be measured given the possibility that one or the other might
545 differ depending on the pain induction technique used. The number of studies examining
546 differences in pain perception in contact sports has increased in the last decade when compared to
547 the first studies in the 60s. It is therefore crucial to adhere to rigorous definitions and justified
548 testing methods to further homogenize the literature. A more rigorous classification of the exact
549 pain profile of contact athletes could also help inform the optimal ways to study them. To our
550 knowledge, no method was used to explore pain caused by impact to bone like that caused by
551 shin-to-shin contact (low kick blocks), or shin to hard surface training equipment (heavy bag, pads)
552 in certain striking sports such as Muay Thai, and Japanese kickboxing (K1)[43, 44]. Future studies
Pain in Contact Sports
553 should consider using an experimental bone pain model [45] where an algometer could be applied
554 for example on the shin area rather than on a muscle area.
555 Further longitudinal studies like the one done by Thornton et al. [28], should also be considered
556 to further parse the role of participation in contact sports in pain perception. If a change is indeed
557 attributed to training, then it would imply that it is not a natural advantage that allows athletes to
558 excel in their sport despite pain, but rather a developed ability. Such longitudinal studies could
559 highlight the mechanisms associated with the development of pain reduction in contact sport
560 athletes.
561 Finally, as pain is a perception and results from peripheral and central neurophysiological
562 processes, referred to as nociception in the pain literature, future studies should be interested in
563 differences in nociception between contact sport and other athletes. For example, future studies
564 should investigate whether different sport expertise affect the nociceptive flexion reflex (R-III)
565 which is considered as an index of spinal nociception with tonic supra-spinal influences [46]. Tests
566 of central pain summation (e.g., [17, 42, 47]) or other pain modulation tests, such as heterotopic
567 noxious counter-stimulation (conditioned pain modulation) [17], could be used to assess the
568 efficacy of central pain regulatory mechanisms. Differences in brain responses to painful stimuli
569 and to pain modulation tests between athletes with various sport expertise could further help
570 document possible changes in these central processes.
