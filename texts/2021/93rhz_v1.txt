Abstract
Are people motivated to feel that clothes worn by members of their political ingroup (outgroup) are
more (less) beautiful and valuable? Building on research on politically motivated judgments, affective
polarization, and social distancing, this study investigated how aesthetic judgments about the design
and color of clothes, and willingness to pay for identical clothes, changed among Swedes (N=638)
after they learnt that the clothes were worn by politicians from their most- or least-liked party. The
results supported both a negative outgroup effect (i.e., clothes associated with the least-liked party
became less attractive) and a positive ingroup effect (i.e., clothes associated with the most-liked party
became more attractive and valuable). Clothes worn by non-politicians were evaluated similarly after
the identity of the person wearing them was revealed. Particularly the positive ingroup effect was
stronger among rightists than leftists, consistent with theoretical accounts that posit ideological
asymmetries in motivated reasoning and relational motivations.
Keywords: Political polarization; affective polarization; social distancing; party over policy effect;
aesthetic judgments of clothes.

Politically motivated (or directional) thinking, which is underpinned by a desire to reach a politically
desirable conclusion, has been studied extensively in psychological research. Studies have found, for
instance, that people tend to evaluate information as more credible when it is framed as being
consistent with their political position or partisanship (Ditto et al., 2019; Flynn et al., 2017). But do
people also make politically motivated aesthetic judgments? Specifically, do they perceive a piece of
clothing as more (or less) beautiful and valuable just because they see a politician from their favorite
(or least favorite) party wearing it?
There are reasons to believe that people do make such politically motivated aesthetic judgments. Most
generally, human beings are social creatures (Brown, 2000; Tajfel et al., 1979), and the human
tendency to behave more favorably toward ingroup-members than toward outgroup-members, which
can be driven both by ingroup love and outgroup hate (Brewer, 1999), is well-documented (Balliet et
al., 2014). Although people can have several social identities at once (e.g., American, Hispanic,
engineer), political ideology and partisan affiliation make up some of the strongest social identities in
modern democratic societies (Iyengar et al., 2012), in which political choices have increasingly
become more a matter of personal values, preferences, and identity than gender, ethnicity, and social
class (Caprara & Vecchione, 2017; Johnston et al., 2017).
Whether political opponents have moved further apart in terms of preferred policies or factual beliefs
over time—that is, whether ideological polarization (Taber & Lodge, 2006; Lewandowsky &
Oberauer, 2016) has occurred—is a matter controversy (Westfall et al., 2015). There is, however, a
broader consensus on the notion that affective polarization, which happens when animosity between
political in- and outgroups increases (Iyengar et al., 2019; Finkel et al., 2020), is on the rise in most
countries, including Europe (Reiljan, 2019) and Sweden (Renström et al., 2019). For instance,
longitudinal studies in the United States have suggested that people’s negative feelings toward their
political outgroups have grown more intense from 2010 to 2020 (Druckman et al., 2021; Finkel et al.,
2020).
Affective polarization can be assessed in various ways, and recent research has suggested that there
are at least two different kinds of operationalizations that tap into different forms of polarization
(Druckman & Levendusky, 2019). The first includes feeling thermometer measures, where affective
polarization is measured in terms of the difference between attitudes of the political ingroup and the
political outgroup (Lavrakas, 2008; Lelkes & Westwood, 2017), and measures of trust toward ingroup
(vs. outgroup) partisans or perceptions of traits that are representative of ingroups and outgroups
(Garrett et al., 2014). The second, which is particularly relevant for the current research, includes
preferred social distance measured in terms of questions about, for instance, how comfortable people
would be to work with an outgroup-partisan (vs. ingroup-partisan) or to have their child marrying a
person from the political outgroup (Levendusky & Malhotra, 2016).
Research has suggested that people avoid individuals from their political outgroups, for example,
when deciding whose arguments to listen to (Frimer et al., 2017), whom to date (Mallinas et al., 2018),
where to live (Motyl et al., 2014), whom to hire for a job (Gift & Gift, 2015), and how much time to
spend at a thanksgiving dinner (Chen & Rohla, 2018). These behaviors exemplify social distancing
that is direct in the sense that people avoid contact with individuals or groups, that are explicitly and
obviously partisan.
Other studies have suggested that people tend to distance themselves from ambiguous policies or ideas
that they perceive to be associated with their political outgroup. This “party over policy-effect” is
usually tested by having participants read a policy suggestion while experimentally manipulating
which political side suggested it, and people tend to be negative toward any policy that is proposed by
their political outgroup and positive toward most policies suggested by the political ingroup (Cohen,
2003; Tannenbaum et al., 2017; van Boven et al., 2018; Verkuyten & Maliepaard, 2013). This is a
good example of partisan contact-phobia that is indirect in the sense that a potentially neutral policy
can be “contaminated” simply by being suggested or endorsed by an individual’s least-liked party.
Past studies have shown that perceived partisanship can influence economic behaviors and purchase
intentions as well. For instance, one study found that US voters were more likely to purchase
discounted gift cards when these had been used in the political campaign of their preferred party (vs.
the campaign of the other party; McConnell et al., 2018), and another study found that people were
less likely to pay visit to a restaurant that had sponsored their political outgroup and more likely to pay
visit to a restaurant that had sponsored their political ingroup (Panagopoulos et al., 2020).
In the current research, we investigated whether people would also be more likely to make more
positive (or more negative) aesthetic judgments and show higher (or lower) purchasing intentions
toward a type of neutral product – specifically clothing – after it had become associated with their
most- or least-liked political party. In other words, are people motivated to perceive clothes worn by
members of their political ingroup as more beautiful and valuable and clothes worn by outgroup
members as less beautiful and valuable?
The Current Research
A limitation of previous measures of politically motivated social distancing is that they are
confounded by the political contents of the stimuli that participants evaluated. For instance, in studies
of attitudes to policies, it is possible that people use outgroup and ingroup affiliation as informational
cues about what they would think about the policy if they were fully informed. Likewise, in the
aforementioned studies of purchasing intentions, it is likely that people thought that purchasing the
products or services that were associated with political ingroups would financially reward these
groups. These problems echo the more general methodological problem of separating motivated
(directional) reasoning from other kinds of non-directional motives (Tappin et al., 2020).
In the current research, we presented participants with pictures of non-political clothes and asked them
to make aesthetic judgments about the design and color of these clothes and to report how much they
were willing to pay for identical clothes. We used a novel repeated-measures design, in which the
participants evaluated the same clothes both before and after they were shown a picture of a famous
politician wearing them.
The main reason that we used clothes as the consumer product is that clothes are typically evaluated in
terms of their visual attractiveness. Making aesthetic judgments about clothes is an inherently non-
political task that does not require any political knowledge that could confound the measure of
distancing. Furthermore, the partisan association with the products was indirect and arbitrary in this
study—the clothing-brands were not sponsoring any of the politicians who were shown in the pictures,
and there was no political or personal gain or loss for the politician if people would change their
aesthetic judgments. Therefore, effects documented in this paradigm would be clear evidence of
politically motivated indirect social distancing in the aesthetic domain. Following the suggestion by
van Boven & Sherman (2021), to separate ingroup and outgroup influences on social norms, we
hypothesized that two separate effects would occur:
A negative outgroup-effect: people find clothes less attractive and less valuable after learning about a
random association between these clothes and their least-liked party.
A positive ingroup-effect: people find clothes more attractive after learning about a random association
between these clothes and their most-liked party.
We tested both these effects on three dependent variables: perceived attractiveness of the design of the
clothes, perceived attractiveness of the color of the clothes, and willingness to pay for identical
clothes. To rule out mere exposure effects (i.e., that people find clothes more attractive the more they
are exposed to them), we also asked the participants to rate clothes worn by non-politicians.
Moreover, we were interested in whether these effects are symmetrical (i.e., equally strong for leftist
and rightist participants) or asymmetrical (i.e., more pronounced among leftists or rightists). Many
studies have found that conservatives (vs. liberals) tend to exhibit greater ingroup centrism and
relational motivation (Jost et al., 2018; McFarland et al., 2012; Waytz et al., 2019), and a greater
proneness to cognitive biases and motivated thinking (Baron & Jost, 2019; Jost, 2017). These findings
suggest that we should see more ingroup and outgroup effects in aesthetic judgments among rightists
than among leftists (cf., the rigidity-of-the-right hypothesis). On the other hand, some scholars have
contended that the aforementioned tendencies are similar across partisan lines but stronger among
ideological extremists and authoritarians in any political camp (Costello et al., 2021; Crawford &
Brandt, 2020, Ditto et al., 2019; Van Prooijen & Krouwel, 2019).
Another significant feature of the current research is that we collected data from a nationally
representative sample of Swedes. Because the vast majority of studies in this area of research have
been conducted in the United States, there is a need for research on representative samples from other
countries (Gidron et al., 2019; Leeper & Slothuus, 2014). It is particularly valuable to investigate
whether the same kinds of affective polarization that occur between Democrats and Republicans in the
context of the US biparty system occur also in European countries with multi-party systems and
multifaceted ideological landscapes (Nilsson et al., 2020). As of 2021, there are no less than eight
parties in Swedish parliament. The Left party (LP), Green party (GP), and Social-democratic party (S),
which subscribe to socialist, environmentalist, and social-democratic ideologies respectively, make up
the traditional left-wing parties. The Christian Democratic party (CD), Moderate party (M), and
Sweden Democratic party (SD), which subscribe to social-conservative, liberal-conservative, and
nationalist-conservative ideologies respectively, represent the right-wing parties. The Center (C) and
Liberal (L) parties, which are both based on social-liberal ideology, are traditionally center-right
parties but have recently shifted alliances and are therefore difficult to categorize as clearly leftist or
rightist.
Method
Participants were recruited through the independent data collection company PFM research. We
requested 600 complete responses from a sample that was representative of the adult Swedish
population in terms of gender, age, region, and political affiliation. The total sample size (after
exclusions) ended up being 638 (51.3% female, 48.4% male: M = 49.31 years, SD = 16.26). The
age
participants were told that the purpose of the study was to investigate how people perceive and
evaluate clothes.1
The participants were first shown 17 pictures, each depicting a piece of clothing (e.g., a dress, jacket,
blouse, or blazer), in a randomized order. The clothes were always worn by a person, but the pictures
were cropped so that the face of the wearer was not visible. For each picture, the participants evaluated
the “design and fit” and “the color” of the depicted clothes on visual analogue scales ranging from -50
(“Very ugly”) to +50 (“Very beautiful”). In addition, they rated their willingness to purchase clothes
for themselves or for someone they knew by choosing the highest price range that they would agree to
pay for clothes identical to the depicted clothes. The suggested ranges were in 250SEK (≈ $30)
increments so that a score of 1 represented 0-250 SEK and a score of 8 represented 1751-2000 SEK (9
= 2001SEK or more).

The participants thereafter reported their current age, their gender identity (1 = “Woman”, 2 = “Man”,
3 = “Other/do not want to say”), their fashion interest (1 = “No interest”, 7 = “Very interested”), their
feelings toward each of the eight parties in the Swedish parliament (visual analogue scale: -50 =
“Strongly dislike”, 0 = “Neither dislike nor like”, +50 = “Strongly like”), the parties they liked the
most and the least (forced-choice questions), and finally their left-right self-placement (-50 =
“Strongly leftist”, + 50 = “Strongly rightist”).
Participants then evaluated the same 17 clothes (in a randomized order) as in the first part of the study,
as well as two additional pictures of clothes that were presented before the others. As before, they
evaluated design, color, and how much they were willing to pay for identical clothes. The first
additional picture was included to put the participants in a mindset that they would evaluate new
clothes in this round. The second additional picture served as an attention check (the participants were
asked to respond “501-750 SEK” to show that they were attentive).
The main difference from the first part of the study was that the pictures were no longer cropped,
which means that the face of the wearer was visible. Three of the pictures were stock photos depicting
unknown non-politicians (one man and two women), but the other 14 pictures showed well-known
Swedish politicians. We included one male and one female politician from each of the three left-wing
parties (LP, GP, and S) and from each of the three right-wing parties (CD, M and SD). Because C and
L are not unequivocally left- or right-wing, these parties were represented by just one picture each
showing their respective party leaders (both were women). We used existing photographs of
politicians, but we matched pairs of pictures for the left- and right-wing parties so that the age, gender,
pose, and type of clothing were as similar as possible. Name and party affiliation of the politician were
written above the pictures to increase party salience.2
Statistical Analyses
As preregistered, participants who failed the attention check (n = 57) were screened out prior to the
analyses. Participants who chose either LP, GP, or S as their most-liked party (n = 284) were classified
as leftists whereas participants who chose either CD, M, or SD were classified as rightists (n = 267).
Participants who chose C or L as their most-liked party (n = 87) were excluded from analyses that
compared leftist and rightist participants. As a robustness check, we repeated the analyses with
political placement based on least-liked parties and on political left-right self-placement; results of
these tests are reported in the supplementary material posted on OSF, and summarized in the general
discussion. Statistical analyses were done in SPSS version 28.0.0.0 unless stated otherwise. All
manipulations, measures, and exclusions are reported.
2 Finally, participants again reported their feelings toward each of the eight parties represented in the Swedish
parliament using the same response scale as before (feelings toward parties are not reported in this manuscript,
but all variables are included in the data file).
To test the hypotheses, we first conducted a 3 (Partisan association of clothes: Most-liked party/Least-
liked party/Non-political) * 2 (Time: 1[without political cues]/2[with political cues]) repeated
measures ANOVA for each dependent variable. A significant interaction effect would indicate that
people’s evaluations of clothes are influenced by the induced partisan association. We followed up
significant interactions with paired t-tests (comparing change from Time 1 to Time 2) for each
dependent variable (design, color, and willingness to pay) to test the negative outgroup and positive
ingroup effects separately and to test if evaluations of clothes worn by non-politicians changed
between Time 1 and Time 2.
To investigate the presence of ideological asymmetries in the magnitude of the effects, we conducted
mixed 2 (Participant: leftist/rightist) * 2 (Time: 1[without political cues] /2[with political cues])
ANOVAs with evaluations of color, design, and willingness to pay for clothes associated with the
participant’s most-liked party (the ingroup effect) and the least-liked party (the outgroup effect) as the
dependent variables (i.e., six mixed ANOVAs in total). A significant interaction effect on evaluations
of clothes associated with the most liked party would indicate that the ingroup effect is moderated by
participants political orientation (and vice versa for the outgroup effect). We subsequently added
changes in corresponding evaluations (design, color, or willingness to pay) for non-political clothes as
a covariate in a first step and fashion interest as a covariate in a second step to gauge the robustness of
the effects. We did not to add gender or age as covariates because they both correlated with having a
rightist most-liked party (male gender: r = .16, p < .001; age: r = .11, p = .009), which means that
including them as covariates would entail a risk of corrupting the interaction we were interested in
(Miller & Chapman, 2001).
Because standard null-hypothesis testing cannot provide support for the null hypothesis (a non-
significant result can always be due to limited statistical power), we used equivalence testing to test
for the absence of a meaningful difference (Lakens, 2017; Lakens et al., 2018). We did this by
comparing leftist and rightist participants (classified based on their most-liked party) in terms of their
change scores (i.e., evaluations at Time 1 subtracted from evaluations at Time 2). A significant null-
hypothesis test for the interaction terms together with a non-significant equivalence test for the change
scores would indicate that the compared means differ in a meaningful way. The smallest effect size of
interest (SESOI) was set to d = 0.25 for the paired t-tests and d = 0.25 for the independent t-tests. The
rationale for this was that effect sizes smaller than this should have very limited practical significance.
The power for detecting these effect sizes with the sample size in this study was over 99% for the
mixed ANOVAs and 90% for the independent t-tests (Faul et al., 2007).
We followed our preregistration with respect to sample size, handling of outliers, and hypotheses. We
did, however, deviate mildly from the preregistered plan for the analyses. The initial plan was that the
main analyses would aggregate evaluations of clothes worn by leftist politicians and clothes worn by
rightist politicians and compare leftist and rightist participants’ change in evaluations toward all leftist
and rightist clothes in a 2(Time 1/Time 2) * 2(Leftist/Rightist clothes) * 2(Leftist/Rightist participant)
ANOVA. The rationale for this aggregation was that it would increase the reliability of the estimates.
The analyses of changes in evaluations of clothes worn by politicians form the participant’s most-liked
and least-liked parties were described as secondary analyses in the pre-registration. Nevertheless, we
ultimately decided to report results from the analyses based on least- and most-liked party in the main
text, because this classification more directly maps onto ingroup- and outgroup affiliations, and there
was substantial variability in the participants’ feelings toward different left- and right-wing parties.
Results based on the left vs. right classification of the clothes are reported in the supplementary
material on OSF.
We added non-preregistered Holm-Bonferroni corrections of the alpha thresholds for the six statistical
hypotheses we tested (three for the ingroup effect and three for the outgroup effect) to prevent
inflation of Type 1 error rates. All effects that were originally significant (p < .05) remained
significant (with alpha thresholds ranging from .008 to .017).

Follow-up t-tests indicated that there was no significant change between Time 1 and Time 2 in ratings

politicians was slightly higher at Time 2, but equivalence tests showed that this change was smaller

that evaluations of clothes worn by non-politicians did not change in any meaningful way when the
identity of the wearer was revealed, consistent with our expectations.
For clothes worn by a politician from the participant’s least-liked party, ratings of the design (M =

These results provide evidence of negative outgroup effects in aesthetic judgments of the design and

provide evidence of positive ingroup effects on judgments concerning the design (but not the color)
and the amount of money the participants were willing to pay for the clothes.

Tests of Ideological Symmetries and Asymmetries
A series of mixed ANOVAs revealed that the positive ingroup effect was consistently stronger among
rightist participants. There were significant interaction effects of Most-liked party * Time on
evaluations of the design of the clothes, F(1,549) = 6.20, p = .013, η 2 = .011, the color of the clothes,
F(1,549) = 8.21, p = .004, η 2 = .015, and how much the participants were willing to pay for identical
clothes, F(1,549) = 17.70, p < .001, η 2 = .031. All these interaction effects remained significant when
we entered changes in evaluations for non-political clothes (design, color, or willingness to pay
respectively) from Time 1 to Time 2 and fashion interest as covariates: design, F(1,547) = 4.69, p
= .031, η 2 = .009; color, F(1,547) = 7.89, p = .005, η 2 = .014; and willingness to pay, F(1,547) =
p p
15.34, p < .001, η 2 = .027.
Results concerning the negative outgroup effect were all in the direction of stronger effects among
rightist participants as well, but there was a significant difference between leftist and rightist
participants only for the evaluations of the color of the clothes: F(1,549) = 5.50, p = .019, η 2 = .010
(with both covariates: F[1,547] = 6.40, p = .012, η 2 = .012. There were no significant differences in
the evaluation of the design of the clothes, F(1,549) = 2.38, p = .123, η 2 = .004 (with both covariates:
F[1,547] = 2.96, p = .086, η 2 = .005), or the willingness to pay for the clothes, F(1,549) = .73, p
= .392, η 2 = .001 (with both covariates: F[1,547] = 1.31, p = .253, η 2 = .002).

With respect to the covariates, changes in non-political evaluations of the clothes consistently

results from the equivalence tests and from independent t-tests comparing the change scores of leftists
and rightist participants. Equivalence was obtained only for willingness to pay for clothes worn by
politicians from the least-liked party and for evaluations of the color of clothes worn by non-
politicians. In other words, we can conclude that the differences between leftists and rightists were
beneath the stipulated threshold for a meaningful effect only for these two dependent variables (out of
nine in total).
Taken together, these results suggest that there are ideological asymmetries in politically motivated
aesthetic judgments such that rightists exhibit a stronger positive ingroup effect, but the results are less
conclusive with regards to the negative outgroup effect.

Discussion
This research is the first to demonstrate politically motivated aesthetic judgments. The results provided
evidence for both ingroup and outgroup effects (for two out of three dependent variables each) on how
attractive and valuable people find a piece of clothing after it has become arbitrarily associated with
their most- or least-liked political party. Specifically, the participants found clothes both more
attractive in terms of their design and worth a higher price after they had seen picture of a politician
from their most-liked party wearing them, and they found clothes less attractive in terms of both
design and color after they had seen a picture of a politician from their least-liked party wearing them.
These results advance the growing bodies of research on motivated judgments (Ditto et al., 2019;
Flynn et al., 2017) and affective polarization (Iyengar et al., 2019; Finkel et al., 2020) in general, and
on politically motivated social distancing (Motyl et al., 2014; Gift & Gift, 2015) and the “party over
policy”-paradigm (van Boven et al., 2018; Verkuyten & Maliepaard, 2013) in particular. They provide
clear evidence of indirect politically motivated social distancing in the aesthetic domain.
The results of this study also provide some evidence of ideological asymmetries in politically
motivated aesthetic judgments. Rightists (vs. leftists) consistently exhibited a stronger ingroup effect,
with greater increases in attractiveness ratings and in how much they were willing to pay for the
clothes after these had become associated with their preferred party. Although rightists decreased color
evaluations of least-liked party clothes slightly more than leftists, the outgroup effect was more
symmetric across partisan lines.3 These results are consistent with accounts positing ideological
asymmetries in relational motivations and cognitive biases (e.g., Jost, 2017; Waytz et al., 2019), and
suggest that differences between rightists and leftists pertain more to conformity with the ingroup than
to animosity toward the outgroup.
There are several notable strengths of the current research. First, while most previous research has
used convenience samples from the US, we recruited a representative sample from Sweden, which has
multi-party system with a more ideologically heterogeneous political landscape (Gidron et al., 2019;
Knudsen, 2021; Nilsson et al., 2020). Second, the paradigm we introduced permits stronger
conclusions about motivated judgments than do many other common paradigms: aesthetic judgments
of clothes that are arbitrarily associated with a political party are unlikely to be confounded by
political beliefs or intentions to reward or punish a particular group, and the repeated measures design
we used allowed us to isolate the effect of the arbitrary partisan association. Third, in contrast to
studies that, for instance, contrast people’s reactions to their most-liked party against reactions to all
other parties on average (Renström et al., 2020), we disentangled effects of affiliation with the ingroup
3 The results were similar but not identical when classifying participants based on their least-liked party or based
on their political self-placement. No matter type of classification, rightist participants demonstrated a stronger
ingroup effect than leftists for all outcome variables. Nevertheless, we found no evidence of asymmetries for the
outgroup effect with the least-liked or self-placement classifications. See supplementary material on OSF.
and distancing toward the outgroup, because studies have suggested that outgroup aversion is a
stronger identity cue than ingroup affection nowadays (e.g. Finkel et al., 2020). Fourth, because there
are multiple legitimate ways to classify participants in terms of party preference within a multiparty
system, we repeated the analyses based on different classifications as a robustness test (see
supplementary material on OSF). Fifth, we empirically tested not just the presence of ideological
asymmetries but also the presence of symmetries, which cannot be validly inferred from the lack of
significant differences (Lakens, 2017).
Limitations of the current research include that we only used clothes as the non-political product that
was to be associated (or “contaminated”) by partisanship. Clothes play a central role in defining and
communicating social identities (Feinberg et al., 1992). The results can therefore not tell us whether
politically motivated aesthetic judgments occur more broadly also for consumer products such as
chocolate bars or toothpastes that are less outwardly visible and less important for social identity.
Furthermore, this study did not investigate underlying causal mechanisms. It cannot tell us, for
instance, whether effects were driven by a need to affiliate and identify with ingroup members, an
internalized fear of social sanctions for liking an outfit worn by an outgroup politician, a false
perception that the evaluations of the clothes reward an ingroup or an outgroup, or emotional reactions
of disgust or admiration evoked by the politicians that were shown in the pictures.
Another limitation is that we only used members of the political elite (i.e., Swedish party leaders) as
the source of the partisan associations with the non-political product. The results can therefore not tell
us whether introducing an association between a non-political product and a non-elite partisan would
produce similar effects. Theories of cultural evolution propose that people use dominance and prestige
as cues to success and therefore tend to imitate people who possess these qualities (Henrich, 2015),
which suggests that the origins of the partisan association may play a critical role. Future research
could therefore investigate how evaluations and purchase intentions of non-political products change
when the origin of the association is, for instance, an unknown identified individual who votes for the
participant’s most- or least-liked party, a famous person who is not a politician, or a norm or general
tendency to like a particular product within a political in- or outgroup.
