GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
Abstract
How motivated a person is to pursue a goal may depend on many different properties of the goal,
such as how specific it is, how important it is to the person, and how actionable it is. Rigorously
measuring all of the relevant goal characteristics is still very difficult. Existing measures are
scattered across multiple research fields. Some goal characteristics are not yet covered, while
others have been measured under ambiguous terminology. Other conceptually related
characteristics have yet to be adapted to goals. Last but not least, the validity of most measures
of goal characteristics has yet to be assessed. The aim of this study is to: a) integrate, refine, and
extend previous measures into a more comprehensive battery of self-report measures, the Goal
evidence of validity. In two empirical studies, this paper provides evidence for the validity of the
measures regarding their internal structure, measurement invariance, and convergence and
divergence with other relevant goal-related measures, such as the motivation, affect, and the
dimensions of Personal Project Analysis. The results show that our goal characteristic
dimensions have incremental validity for explaining important outcomes, such as goal
commitment and well-being. It concludes with practical recommendations for using the GCQ in
research on goal-setting and goal-pursuit, and a discussion about directions for future studies.

GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
Development and Validation of a Goal Characteristics Questionnaire
Goals are one of the fundamental concepts in motivation science. They can be defined as
"internal representations of desired states" (Austin & Vancouver, 1996, p. 338) that can guide
behavior at both conscious and unconscious levels (Bargh et al., 2001). Goals can vary on
several reasonably obvious dimensions, such as duration in time, difficulty, and abstraction. For
example, a short, easy, and concrete goal might be to reply to three emails in the next 15 minutes.
A longer-term, challenging, and abstract goal might be to increase insight into one’s own
behaviors. An essential task of research on goals is to discover and adequately measure the
characteristics of the goal that are important for goal-pursuit processes, the goal’s outcomes, and
people’s lives more generally.
Over the years, an enormous amount of research from across many disciplines has
investigated goals and attempted to describe their key features, functioning, and effects (e.g.,
Chidester & Grigsby, 1984; Kleingeld et al., 2011; Mento et al., 1987; Wood et al., 1987). Initial
attempts to measure important characteristics or consequences of psychological phenomena in
emerging research areas are often somewhat piecemeal. Ideally, sustained inquiry develops
toward elaboration and systematization of measurement approaches. The attempt to characterize
aspects of people’s goals is paradigmatic of this elaboration process but remains at the
elaboration stage and a lot of work remains to be done. This state of affairs leaves the possibility
that essential goal characteristics and valuable targets of goal-setting interventions are
overlooked.
Despite the large number of studies, the validity of self-report measures of goal
characteristics has not been systematically investigated for all available measures yet. Therefore,
this project aims to develop new measures and validate a context-independent measure of
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
multiple goal characteristics studied previously. This is important for at least three reasons. First,
there are no studies evaluating the psychometric proprieties of a self-report measure that
subsumes a broad range of goal characteristics that have previously been shown to be related to
outcome variables such as goal achievement, motivational quality, real-world behaviors, and
well-being (Milyavskaya & Werner, 2018). Additionally, not all extant measures for individual
measures have been validated. Second, it can provide a standard instrument by which goal-
setting interventions can be evaluated, paving the way for a more practical knowledge base on
the effects of such interventions. Third, the ability to characterize goals along a large set of
dimensions can advance research on goal taxonomies. Therefore, the study aims to advance the
measurement of important constructs for goal setting and goal pursuit.
The psychometric measures used so far show a number of shortcomings and limitations.
Their reliability and validity are, in some cases, limited by a small number of items and missing
empirical evidence for the correlation to latent variables (Milyavskaya & Werner, 2018). The
specificity of measures to a particular context is an additional limitation when comparing effects
(e.g., comparing the impact of avoidance goals in educational, organizational, and personal
goals). Therefore, evaluating their internal structure is an important step that has not yet been
systematically investigated.
Some goal characteristics have been studied under ambiguous terms in achievement goal
literature (Pintrich, 2000). This has led to studies concerned with disambiguation and
clarification of constructs. For instance, “goal coherence”, “goal integrity”, and “goal
congruence” are semantically related terms, which have been disentangled in a meta-analysis by
Hulleman et al. (2010). Performance-approach goals are another example of a construct being
operationalized inconsistently, according to Senko & Dawson (2017).
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
Some goal characteristics have been amalgamated in goal-setting research. The
aforementioned performance-approach goals are a combination of the approach-avoidance
characteristic and master-performance characteristic. In specific contexts, such a combination
may lead to scientific insights, but such an entanglement may prevent the examination of
essential subtleties with other goal characteristics. The aforementioned issues in existing
measures can be overcome by providing clear empirical evidence of the dimensionality of goal
characteristics and validity based on their relationship with other goal-related measures.
This paper describes the process of scale development and two studies conducted to
provide evidence of validity on different levels. The paper is structured as follows. First, the
development process is presented and the resulting scale structure of a self-report measure of
many goal characteristics is established. Then two empirical studies are summarized. Study 1
was designed to evaluate the self-report questionnaire using exploratory and confirmatory factor
analyses and provide evidence for validity based on the internal structure. Study 2 provides
evidence of validity by examining correlations between dimensions of conceptually related
constructs and dimensions of the proposed questionnaire. Lastly, the implications of the results
are discussed, and important practical considerations for applied research are mentioned. Finally,
the methodological potential of the GCQ to advance the goal-setting and motivation research is
pointed out.
Methodology used for Development and Refinement of the Initial GCQ
The initial GCQ subscales and items were developed in an iterative process of extensive
literature search, scale and item generation, evaluation by specialists, empirical evaluation and
refinement. Because the focus was on goal-setting rather than on goal-pursuit, characteristics
closely related to the latter, such as goal progress and monitoring, and goal-related emotions,
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
such as regret and pride, were excluded. Other characteristics found in the goal-setting literature
were excluded because of conceptual complexity (e.g., mastery-performance), context-
dependence (e.g., proximal-distal), and relatedness to well-established motivational constructs
(e.g., intrinsic-extrinsic). Considerations about these characteristics can be found in the
discussion.
Before empirical evaluation of the first version of the questionnaire, the items were
evaluated by two psychometricians, and ambiguous items were removed in an item-sort task
(Anderson & Gerbing, 1991). In order to assess the evidence of validity based on its internal
structure, different measurement models were empirically evaluated in Study 1 using both a data-
driven (exploratory graph analysis, EGA; Golino & Epskamp, 2017) and a theoretically based
approach (confirmatory factor analysis, CFA; Thompson, 2004). The results showed a
theoretically and empirically robust structure, with 105 items and 27 factors, most of them
invariant across different goal difficulties, time perspectives, and progress levels. Study 2
investigates evidence of validity based on correlations of GCQ factors with external measures
such as different motivations (e.g., amotivation, extrinsic and intrinsic motivation) and goal
commitment. In addition, the internal structure of the first version was improved regarding its
reliability and invariance. Based on the findings, researchers can be encouraged to use the GCQ
as a reliable tool to derive conclusions with robust validity in similar samples.
The final version of the GCQ measures 32 factors with 135 items. The 32 goal
characteristics were grouped into five theoretical subscales, each containing constructs based on
semantic similarity. Different subscale labels were iteratively created and regrouped until a

Subscales and Goal Characteristics
This section introduces the subscales which group semantically related goal
characteristics, the rationale behind each characteristic, and their importance for goal setting and
pursuit is briefly summarized. We emphasize that the hierarchical theoretical structure does not
reflect an empirical hierarchical latent structure to avoid misunderstandings. Instead, the
subscales are intended to make it a theoretical organization of the 32 goal characteristics. The
subscale structure does not imply that characteristics within one subscale necessarily correlate
with each other. Neither it implies that, in applications where a subset of characteristics is
measured, selecting a full subscale is more reasonable than picking characteristics from various
subscales. Lastly, this questionnaire is not intended to be an exhaustive goal characteristic space
covering the full range of goal characteristics that have been scientifically investigated. The
remainder of this section describes the subscales and the goal characteristics that constitute them.
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
Structural Characteristics Subscale
The structural characteristics subscale is, on the one hand, concerned with the precision
of a goal’s definition, including the specificity of its content and its intended time of
achievement. On the other hand, it was designed to measure the relation of a goal to other goals
in a goal system, such as their level in a hierarchy and congruence with each other. In sum, it
covers six goal characteristics that are described as follows:
Content Specificity. Content specificity describes the degree of precision of the goal
description. This characteristic has been shown to increase the probability of goal achievement
(Locke et al., 1989). Goal specificity and its opposite, goal ambiguity, have been shown to
predict public service motivation (PSM) in a study about motivation in the U.S. Federal
Agencies (Jung & Rainey, 2011).
Time Specificity. Time specificity describes how far the time frame for goal
achievement is precisely defined. It has been found that deadlines for tasks increase the
probability of task completion (Doran, 1981). In the concept of implementation intentions, a
precise time for a task is defined, and a trigger event is specified (if-then plan), which increases
the effectiveness of goals (Gollwitzer, 1999).
Measurability. Measurability describes how easily goal progress can be tracked.
Measurability of progress is of significant relevance for monitoring goal progress and,
consequently, goal achievement (Harkin et al., 2016). Monitoring goal progress is considered
part of self-regulation and metacognition (e.g., Bjork et al., 2013). If an individual can measure
the progress towards a goal or the distance towards a goal, effort and strategies can be adjusted
to ensure goal achievement in time.
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
Hierarchy- Low and High Level. These characteristics describe how much the goal is
considered a low-level goal contributing to a higher-order goal or is the final desired state in
itself that requires the achievement of subgoals. Based on a hierarchical structural organization,
goals can be organized in different levels of abstraction, from describing a very abstract concept
(e.g., “be goals”) to precise motor sequences (e.g., “slice broccoli”; Carver & Scheier, 2001). In
the last decades, the study of goals as parts of goal systems with supportive or conflicting
interrelations has become an emerging field of study (Kung & Scholer, 2018, Ballard, Yeo, Loft,
Vancouver, & Neal, 2016; Kruglanski et al., 2002). The organization and control of behavior in
hierarchical (goal-) structures has been debated, and there is substantial evidence to assume such
representations (Cooper & Shallice, 2006).
Goal Network Congruence. Network congruence quantifies the compatibility of a goal
with other goals and goal systems. Goals have been investigated in isolation but also in relation
to other goals (Louro et al., 2007) and goal systems (Kung & Scholer, 2018). According to Kung
and Scholer (2020), beneficial relations between goals have been studied as “goal facilitation”
(Kruglanski et al., 2002; Riediger, 2007), “goal coherence”, or “goal integrity” (McGregor &
Little, 1998; Talevich, Read, & Walsh, 2014).
Framing Characteristics Subscale
The framing subscale subsumes characteristics related to the perspective towards a goal,
which is subjective and may change over time. A goal can be defined as avoiding versus
approaching a state, maintaining a state versus attaining a state, and focusing on the process of
goal pursuit versus focusing on the final goal. These are different ways of perceiving a goal,
which have been demonstrated to affect our way of dealing with it. Those characteristics might
be well suitable to assess the effects of interventions in a pre/post-test design since the end state
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
of the goal does not need change. In sum, it covers three goal characteristics that are described as
follows:
Approach-Avoidance Framing. Approach-avoidance framing describes whether the
goal aims to avoid an aversive future state or approach the desired state. The distinction between
approach and avoidance goals has emerged from the research on educational psychology (Elliot,
1999; Elliot & McGregor, 2001; Miller, 1944; Elliot & Thrash, 2001). Approach and avoidance
orientation of goals moderate the effect of goal attainment on subjective well-being (Ehrlich,
2012).
Maintenance-Attainment Framing. Maintenance-attainment framing distinguishes
goals that can be achieved and result in a stable achievement, such as completing a marathon, or
goal states which have to be maintained, such as being sportive. Conceptually, maintenance
goals can be seen as reference values or a standard, as outlined in the conceptual work by
Boldero and Francis (2002). The General Approach, attainMent, Maintenance, and Avoidance
(GAMMA) Motivation Scale (Lappi & Wilkowski, 2020) measures this construct as stated in the
name. This characteristic has been shown to impact perceived difficulty and goal choice
(Stamatogiannakis et al., 2018).
Process vs. Outcome Focus. Outcome focus can be defined as the motivation for an
activity because it is a means to a desirable end, whereas process focus is about the means
(Sansone & Thoman, 2005, Freund, Hennecke, & Mustafić, 2012). In other words, the process
vs. outcome focus characteristic describes whether the representation of a goal is focused on the
means leading to the goal, such as climbing the mountain, or on the goal state or outcome, such
as reaching the summit of a mountain. Studies found goal focus changes across adulthood, in
which people shift from outcome- to process-focus with age (Hennecke, & Mustafić, 2012). It
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
has been shown that goal focus changes during action phases because the phases require a
different perspective in terms of process and outcome (Freund, Hennecke, & Mustafić, 2012).
Attainability Characteristics Subscale
The attainability subscales subsume constructs that are related to successful goal
achievement. Many of the following characteristics can be related to the concept of S.M.A.R.T
goals by Doran (1981), defined as specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-related and
originate from the management domain. In sum, it covers six goal characteristics that are
described as follows:
Immediate Actionability. Immediate actionability measures the perceived height of the
internal or external hurdle to act upon. It is closely related to the specificity of Doran’s (1981)
S.M.A.R.T goals. Planning strategies, such as implementation intentions (Gollwitzer, 1999), rely
on this goal characteristic. Low scores in this characteristic may indicate a need for planning.
Estimated Effort. Estimated effort is intended to measure the amount of mental or
physical effort the process of goal striving costs, approximated from the current point in time.
The perceived effort may depend on other goal characteristics. For example, a hard task for a
goal with high self-congruence may feel less demanding than an easy task for a goal with low
self-congruence. Subjective ease has been shown to benefit goal progress (Werner et al., 2016).
Plannability. Plannability measures to which extent the steps towards goal pursuit are
foreseeable. This aspect of goal setting is essential for estimations about the duration, effort, and
circumstances of goal achievement. People tend to concentrate their time planning on the near
future (Lynch et al., 2010). Therefore, plannability can be an elementary target for most
inventions. Perceived low plannability does not necessarily indicate a factual low plannability,
but the opposite: low scores for this characteristic may indicate a lack of planning.
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
Controllability. Controllability quantifies the degree to which a person perceives the
locus of control for a specific goal within himself versus the environment. Certainly, some goals
lie beyond one’s control, such as winning a lottery or having good weather tomorrow. For most
of the goals humans have, they also have control. Personality psychology has studied how people
perceive causality for a long time (Russell, 1982; Crafts & Rotter, 1955), so trait factors may
influence this goal characteristic. For example, locus of control is a trait variable that reflects the
degree to which a person believes the control about events in their life lies within or outside
himself. Locus of control is a strong predictor of attitudes, motivation, and behavior (Galvin et
al., 2018). Intuitively, a necessary prerequisite for taking an action towards a goal is a belief in
the control over the outcome; however, belief alone is insufficient.
Challenge. The goal property of challenge has already been investigated early in the
history of goal setting. Locke and Latham (1991) postulated in their goal-setting theory that the
perceived challenge of a goal correlates positively to performance (Lunenburg, 2011), as long as
the limit of perceived ability is not exceeded. Above this point, productivity drops due to
hopelessness to reach the goal (Latham & Locke, 1991).
Defined Subgoals. The number of defined subgoals is the operationalization of the
degree to which a plan for goal achievement has been established and can be described with a set
of subgoals, possibly in a logical order. In practice, it can measure the degree to which a plan for
goal pursuit has already been explicitly determined or how far it needs to be done. The study of
multiple goals instead of isolated goals is an emerging field (see, for instance, Louro et al., 2007,
which is the motivation for the authors to introduce this subscale).
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
Resources Availability Characteristics Subscale
The resources availability subscale assesses the degree of presence of facilitators for
goal pursuit. Semantically, the characteristics from this scale are related to the attainability
characteristics. For example, goals with sparse or unavailable crucial resources probably result in
high scores for the challenge characteristic and low scores for the immediate actionability
characteristic. The separation into two separate subscales was motivated to distinguish
characteristics based on the resource-related nature. The diversification of resource availability
has high practical relevance because lacking support for goal pursuit may result in compensation
strategies or goal abandonment. The characteristics in this scale were also inspired by the job
demands-resources model, which aims to explain job engagement, which the authors assume to
be close to goal commitment, based on job demands and a set of resources (Demerouti &
Bakker, 2011). In sum, this subscale covers seven goal characteristics that are described as
follows:
Social Support. The characteristic of social support quantifies the degree of perceived
support in the social environment to attain a goal. In the educational context, it has been shown
that perceived social support can positively affect motivation and achievement (Song et al.,
2015).
Informational Support. Informational support is the availability of information
necessary for successful goal pursuit. Informational support has been investigated as a part of
social support (Malecki & Demaray, 2003). It plays a central role in educational contexts where
the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and competencies strongly rely on the availability of
information.
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
Instrumental Support. Instrumental support is the availability of equipment and
materials required for successful goal pursuit. It is reasonable to assume that the (perceived)
availability of required materials is a necessary precondition for goal pursuit. The creation of
subgoals or withdrawal might compensate for a lack of instrumental support. Instrumental
support has also been investigated as a part of social support (Malecki & Demaray, 2003).
Financial Affordance. Financial affordance is the availability of monetary resources
required for goal pursuit. As such, it is a specific aspect of instrumental support that can affect
goal-setting. For example, the financial affordance of health care services can impact treatment
options (e.g., Ren et al., 2019) and, therefore, impact if and how people pursue their health-
related goals.
Visibility. Visibility is the characteristic of a goal being visible by the social
environment. Visibility is considered a resource since public commitment to a goal improves
goal commitment (Locke & Latham, 2002). On the other hand, public visibility of identity-
related behavioral intentions can decrease the respective behavior caused by the premature sense
of possessing the desired identity and decreasing effort to attain it (Gollwitzer et al., 2009).
Therefore, visibility can unfold positive effects by increasing commitment to a goal. Still,
visibility can be counterproductive, especially for identity-related goals, because it leads to
rewarding experiences before the goal is reached. Furthermore, the social status of the audience
knowing about a goal was found to be positively correlated to goal commitment (Klein et al.,
2020).
Time Availability. Time availability measures the degree to which the time required to
pursue a goal is available. Limited temporal resources are a crucial limitation of goal pursuit and
prioritization. Goal selection and goal disengagement are strategies suitable to deal with it. Time-
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
relatedness is traditionally an essential aspect of effective goal setting (Doran, 1981). In sum,
time is a valuable finite resource whose allocation should be considered during goal selection
and pursuit (e.g., Wrosch et al., 2003).
Competence Adequacy. Competence adequacy is a characteristic related to the required
skills for the person having the goal. If a goal is perceived as far below one’s capabilities, it may
be easy to achieve but may be perceived as not challenging. On the other hand, goals being far
above one’s competencies may be perceived as overwhelming, leading to decreased activity and
motivation (Latham & Locke, 1991). The goal characteristic of competence adequacy is closely
related to self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977), defined as the belief in one’s own competence to
achieve one’s goals, and positively affects health and effectiveness (Bandura, 1982; 1997).
Interestingness Characteristics Subscale
The interestingness subscale subsumes variables related to the subjective relevance of
goals. Although the intrinsic-extrinsic motivational continuum is not directly covered in the
GCQ, the characteristics of this subscale may be suitable to predict it. Most of the constructs of
this subscale have been studied in positive psychology and have been shown to positively affect
well-being. In sum, it covers five goal characteristics that are described as follows:
Self-Congruence. Self-congruence or self-concordance is the degree to which a goal is
perceived to be aligned to the person’s self-concept or identity. Self-congruence can also be
related to the self-determination continuum (SDC; Ryan & Deci, 2000) to measure the degree to
which a goal is internalized. Evaluating a goal’s self-congruence can help people identify a more
intrinsic selection (Sheldon et al., 2019). In addition, it has been shown in a meta-analysis that
self-concordance positively correlates with goal progress (Koestner, Lekes, Powers, & Chicoine,
2002).
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
Value Congruence. Value congruence is the degree to which a goal aligns with one’s
beliefs, values, dreams, and ideal self. Value congruent goals are associated with the experience
of meaning in life (McGregor & Little, 1998). They are a marker of approach motivation and
resource for goal pursuit, especially under uncertainty, anxiety, and threat (McGregor et al.,
2013).
Importance. The importance characteristic measures the personal relevance of a goal. In
situations of goal prioritization, this characteristic may be helpful to determine which goals to
drop. Importance is a commonly used goal characteristic and closely related to goal commitment.
Vancouver and Austin (1996) have identified importance-commitment as one of six factors
found across a broad range of empirical and theoretical goal dimensions.
Awareness. Awareness is the degree to which a goal has been conscious prior to the time
of measurement. It has been demonstrated that goal pursuit can originate and work in the
unconscious level, and even behavior control is possible without conscious awareness (Bargh et
al., 2001; Aarts, Custers, & Veltkamp, 2008). Awareness can moderate the relationship between
goal progress and well-being under certain conditions (Pomaki, Karoly, & Maes, 2009). In social
contexts, goal contagion arises when humans adopt goals implied by the behavior of others
(Aarts, Gollwitzer, & Hassin, 2004). For the investigation of this and related phenomena,
awareness is of relevance. In Study 1, the characteristic was named attentiveness, which turned
out not to be precise because attention is a process that does not require awareness (Dijksterhuis
& Aarts, 2010), hampering the development of a self-report measure.
Vitality. Closely related to the construct of absorption in the engagement literature
(Wefald & Downey, 2009), vitality measures a positive affection in a person elicited by their
goal representation. This variable is a desirable goal characteristic per se, especially from the
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
perspective of positive psychology. Additionally, it has been found to be a predictor of goal
progress (Hope et al., 2016).
Usefulness Characteristics Subscale
The usefulness subscale includes variables of utility a goal may have. The variables of
this subscale are intended to uncover positive and negative rewards on different temporal
horizons as a result of pursuing the goal in question. These characteristics might be especially
relevant for the selection of conscious goals. For example, moral utility theory suggests that
(un-)ethical decisions are based on a trade-off between different aspects of utility (Hirsh et al.,
2018), which might directly affect the selection of altruistic goals. Moreover, subjective
evaluations of direct and indirect outcomes might affect goal selection and pursuit differently
depending on other goal characteristics and the person’s traits and abilities, such as cognitive
control. In sum, it covers five forms of goal characteristics expressing usefulness that are
described as follows:
Long-Term Utility. Long-term utility is the property of goals leading to rewards in the
far future. The long-term utility of a goal is relevant in goal-setting interventions because
humans naturally tend to prefer short-term utility of actions or goals over long-term utility in the
early stages of their development. This ability to choose actions with high long-term utility and
low short-term utility is a skill that has been investigated under the key term of time-perspective
in positive psychology (Boniwell & Zimbardo, 2012).
Short-Term Utility. Short-term utility is the property of goals leading to rewards in the
near future. Balancing time perspectives and overcoming the temptations of immediate benefits
has been considered a key to a good life by positive psychologists (Boniwell & Zimbardo, 2012).
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
For example, interindividual differences in weighting immediate and distant outcomes of actions
are highly relevant for a range of health problems (Strathman et al., 1994).
Relative Utility. Relative utility is the degree to which pursuing a goal leads to rewards
in comparison to other goals. Humans tend to have more goals than they can possibly pursue
with their limited amounts of resources (Neal et al., 2017, Kung & Scholer, 2020), so they have
to decide on which goal to commit to. Multiple goal pursuit is an emerging field of research
(Kung & Scholer, 2020) in which this goal characteristic may be applied.
Self-Improvement Utility. Self-improvement utility quantifies the degree to which the
process of goal pursuit is expected to lead to personal growth or the development of new abilities
or insights. This characteristic is conceptually related to “learning goals”, which are opposed to
“performance goals” in educational psychology (Bouffard, Boisvert, Vezeau, & Larouche,
1995). Growth goals have been shown to predict subjective well-being (SWB) in the future
(Bauer & McAdams, 2010) and goals about eudaimonic functioning have been shown to have
the tendency to succeed (Sheldon, et al., 2019). Moreover, self-improvement motivation is a
relevant motivational tendency in the domain of metacognition (Jiang & Kleitman, 2015).
Negative Utility. Negative utility is a measure of the degree to which achieving a goal
leads to aversive consequences. Negative utility is a relevant feature of goals since most of them
have both positive and negative consequences. In addition, appetite and aversive motivation
elicit distinct neural processes and, consequently, behavioral responses (Yee et al., 2021). This
characteristic arose from separating the reverse coded items of the utility characteristic from the
positively formulated items in the second (see results section of Study 2). The alternative models
of the CFA showed a better fit for a model treating the negative items as belonging to a distinct
factor.
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
To assess the validity of the GCQ, two studies were conducted and reported in the
following two sections. The first study was conducted to measure and improve the internal
validity by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The second study was conducted to
provide evidence of concurrent validity based on comparisons with established measures.
Study 1: Evidence of Validity Based on Internal Structure
Our first study aimed to evaluate the evidence of validity based on the internal structure
of the questionnaire developed so far and to refine its subscales and items. The analyses of Study
1 aim at testing the internal validity using an exploratory and a confirmatory approach of factor
analysis for each subscale. The final measurement models show good fit and reliability indices.
Methods
Participants
A sample of 600 participants was invited to participate in a study about personal goals via
Positly, a web-based research platform, for a compensation of $2.00 for a study lasting
approximately 15 minutes. Of those, 590 participants completed the survey and the results were
included in the analysis (52% female; average age = 40 years, SD = 12 years). To be allowed to
participate in the study, participants had to report to hold US citizenship, be fluent in English and
be above 18 years old.
Measures
The first version of the questionnaire was subdivided into the five subscales structural,
attainability, resource availability, interestingness, and usefulness, measuring 27 latent variables
with 171 items. Participants rated their agreement with them using a five-point scale with levels
ranging from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 (“strongly agree”). Participants also responded to three
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
self-report questions about when they set the goal, its expected time perspective for achievement,
difficulty, and stage (for a full description of these measures, see the Supplementary Material,
Sections 4 and 5).
Procedure
Participants were invited to an online study about personal goals and filled out a consent
form prior to the experiment. In order to increase variability, participants were instructed to think
about individual goals according to one of the randomly assigned prompts, which were validated
in a pilot study (see Supplementary Material, Section 1). The prompts varied in a between-
subjects design. Depending on the condition, participants were asked to report on goals at
different progress levels (“accomplished or almost accomplished (>75%)”, “made considerable
progress (50-75%)”, “some progress (25-49%)”, “little progress or just started (<25%)”, “gave
up”); time perspective (“today”, “this month” and “this year”); and difficulty (“easy” and
“hard”). A graphical scale of progress from 0-100% accompanied the prompts to help
participants interpret the progress prompts. As an example of prompt: “Think about a goal that
you intended to achieve this month that you have already given up and you thought it would be
hard to complete it.”
Following the prompt, participants were asked to write about their goal and about the
reason why they were pursuing it. Next, participants answered the self-report measures regarding
the chosen goal. Afterward, participants answered the GCQ. The order of the GCQ items was
randomized across participants. Lastly, participants answered socio-demographic questions (see
Supplementary Material, Section 2, for details about the elicitation procedure). This study has
been approved by the {masked for review}.

Data Analysis
Because participants were required to answer all questions, all data sets were complete,
and no participants were excluded from the analysis. To investigate the dimensionality of the
observed variables, an exploratory graph analysis (EGA; Golino & Epskamp, 2017) was
conducted for each subscale. EGA is a network-analysis approach to estimate the number of
dimensions to retain. According to the structure suggested by EGA, we modified the
hypothesized model, changing or excluding items with non-predicted relations. Then,
confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted with the diagonal weight least square
estimator (Li, 2016) to compare the fit for this modified structure with alternative models. For
each subscale, fit indices from the null, unifactorial, hypothesized, EGA, and modified models
were compared. In order to compare the effect of conditions, a measurement invariance analysis
and a subsequent MANOVA were conducted with the invariant factors across the conditions. All
analyses were conducted in R v. 3.6.1 (R Core Team, 2016), using lavaan and EGAnet packages
(Rosseel, 2012; Hirschfeld & Brachel, 2019; Golino et al., 2021). Raw data is available at

Scalar Invariance: Effect of Conditions on Factor Scores
Before comparing factor scores between conditions, the authors tested the measures’
scalar invariance to different time perspectives, difficulties, and levels of progress independently.
Scalar invariance refers to the equivalence of the structure, intercepts, and loading coefficients
across groups. Investigating scalar invariance is necessary to be able to adequately compare
differences between the means of latent variables (Chen, 2007). To test for scalar invariance, the
authors estimated models constraining the factor structure, loadings, and thresholds to be equal
across one of the conditions (difficulty, time perspective, and progress) using the delta
parametrization (Millsap & Yun-Tein, 2004). Compared with the unconstrained models, the fit
indices of the constrained models did not decrease above the thresholds of ΔCFI < -.01,
ΔRMSEA > .015, and ΔSRMR > .015 (Chen, 2007; Cheung & Rensvold, 2002), except for
usefulness factors across different levels of progress. For usefulness factors, fit indices for the
model constraining loading coefficients (metric invariance) were above the threshold, ΔCFI =
-.011, ΔRMSEA = .019, and ΔSRMR = .020. These results suggest that scalar invariance can be
assumed across time perspectives, difficulty, and progress, except that usefulness factors are not
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
invariant across different levels of progress. Since usefulness was not invariant across progress
conditions, latent mean differences were tested without usefulness factors (Long-Term, Short-
Term, Relative, and Self-Improvement Utility). For detailed fit indices of configural, metric, and
scalar models across conditions, see Supplementary Material, Section 8.
Mean differences in the factor scores were expected across the prompt conditions (time
perspective, difficulty, and progress) without specific hypotheses. Therefore, the authors
conducted exploratory analyses for direct and interaction effects of the conditions using a
MANOVA. As shown in T0able 8, all direct effects were statistically significant, but no
interaction effects were significant at a corrected alpha level using a Sidak’s correction for seven
comparisons (α = 0.0073).

Supplementary Material (Section 9). When correcting for multiple comparisons, the results show
that Time Availability, Estimated Effort, Plannability, Competence Adequacy, and Challenge

factors scores changed across difficulty conditions. For time perspective, factors scores were
significantly different for Time Specificity, High Hierarchy, Instrumental Support, Financial
Affordance, Competence Adequacy, Challenge, Value Congruence, and Importance changed
across time perspective conditions. Regarding the progress condition, the results show
differences in Content Specificity, Time Specificity, Measurability, Immediate Actionability,
Time Availability, Social Support, Informational Support, Plannability, Competence Adequacy,
Controllability, Defined Subgoals, Self-Congruence and Importance. In general, progress
prompts showed quantitatively more univariate effects, while time perspective prompts showed a
larger multivariate effect size. To conclude, these effects show additional support for the effect of
the prompts (see also Section 1 of the Supplementary Material).
Discussion
This study aimed to investigate the evidence of validity based on the internal structure of
the GCQ. The EGA method allowed us to compare the hypothesized or intended factor structure
with exploratory data-driven models. The hypothesized measurement model was improved by
modifications based on local and global misfits in the models. Although the modified
measurement models show a good fit, a few factors show low loading coefficients and reliability
indices (e.g., Content Specificity, High Hierarchy, Defined Subgoals, Self-Congruence, and
Short-Term Utility). The Structural, Attainability, Resources Availability, and Interestingness
measurement models were invariant across all prompt conditions, allowing the comparison of
several goal characteristics regardless of their goal progress, time perspective, and difficulty.
However, the usefulness subscale was not invariant across progress conditions, hindering the
possibility to compare usefulness factors means if goals diverge in their progress levels. In
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
addition, a high correlation between some factors was observed (see Supplementary Material,
Section 8). However, theoretical differences between the constructs might not have been
captured by the current pool of items. Therefore, the GCQ was modified in Study 2 to overcome
these limitations.
Notably, the effects of the conditions were consistent with logical assumptions. For
example, goals that were almost complete are more specific regarding their content and time of
achievement. They were also more attainable – there are more time available to work on their
goals, they are more plannable, more controllable, more immediate actionable, and they have
more defined subgoals. Goals with longer time perspectives are perceived to have a less defined
time to be achieved, to be more higher-level, challenging, value-congruent, and important. In
addition, people perceive to have less competence, financial and instrumental resources to
achieve them. Hard goals are perceived to be more challenging, require more effort, be less
plannable, and be less adequate to people’s competence.
The questionnaire was improved based on these results for the next study. Items were
added for factors with low reliability and non-invariance across conditions. In addition, items for
new hypothesized factors were added: Process-Outcome Framing, Maintenance-Attainment
Framing, Vitality, Visibility, and Negative Utility. The final version measures 32 latent variables
using 135 items (see Supplementary Material, Section 5). As discussed later, the resulting
version of the GCQ shows good evidence of validity based on its internal structure and related
measures.
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
Study 2: Evidence of Validity Based on Related Measures
The goal of Study 2 was to show concurrent validity of the GCQ, which is relevant
because there are well-established measures for central constructs in motivational research, to
which the GCQ should be compatible and comparable. While Study 1 has shown that the items
of each dimension measure some common latent variable, Study 2 demonstrates that GCQ
factors are correlated to constructs that are theoretically relevant to them. In practice, this is
achieved by showing positive and negative correlations to well-established measures in the field.
The authors agreed on a list of hypotheses about positive and negative correlations between
latent variables of the GCQ and latent variables of other measures that should hold from a
conceptual perspective. Additionally, the GCQ was examined regarding its reliability,
discriminability between factors, and invariance across conditions.
Methods
Participants
Volunteers were invited to participate in an online study about personal goals via Positly.
Participants were compensated with $4.00 for an estimated 30 min study (M = 29.44 min, SD =
14.2 min). A total of 515 participants completed the study. Thirty-three participants who failed to
provide a valid goal were excluded. In addition, six participants were excluded for failing at least
two out of the four attention checks (direct queries) across the survey, 39 participants were
excluded due to their short completion times (less than 15 min), and five observations for being
duplicated. The final sample contained 432 participants with an age average of 38 years (SD = 11
years), from which 49% identified themselves as females.
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
External Measures
The selection of measures was based on the goal of validity testing and our procedure of
predicting relationships with theoretically related constructs. The selected measures are
conceptually related to the dimensions of the GCQ since they provide possible antecedents,
consequents of goal characteristics, or goal characteristics themselves.
Relative Autonomy Continuum (Sheldon et al., 2017). The authors used a self-report
measure of different motivations (Intrinsic, Identified, Positive Introjection, Negative
Introjection, External, and Amotivation) to pursue the chosen goal. Participants rated their
agreement with 16 items (e.g., “because I want to prove to myself that I am capable”) using a 5-
point agreement scale.
Necessity from Goal-Striving Reasons (Ehrlich, 2012). As a complementary measure
for extrinsic motivation, the Necessity factor from the Goal-Striving Reasons was used,
measured by four items focused on the financial motivation necessary for living (e.g., “It helps
me to make a living”). Participants used the same 5-point agreement scale.
Commitment (Hollenbeck et al., 1989). To measure commitment, the degree of personal
engagement or determination to reach the goal, participants answered a 4-item scale (e.g., “It's
unrealistic for me to expect to reach this goal”) using the same 5-point agreement scale as before.
Personal Project Analysis (PPA; McGregor & Little, 1998; Little, 1983). Since the
PPA covers several of the goal characteristics in GCQ, it enables us to test the similarity between
analogous measures. This instrument contains 37 items measuring several aspects related to goal
characteristics (e.g., Importance, Commitment) but also aspects related to goal affect (e.g., “How
proud are you to be engaged in each project?”) or specific requirements (“How much creativity
does each project require of you?”). Factor structures for these instruments were proposed for a
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
smaller set of those items. However, we used the whole set of items in this study since they are
theoretically independent. Participants answered this measure with a 10-point scale specific for
each item (e.g., for the question “How much do you feel you are in control of this project?”,
participants were instructed to “use 10 if you feel completely in control of the project, and 0 if
you feel you have absolutely no control over the project”).
GAMMA Scale (Lappi & Wilkowski, 2020). Approach-Attainment (e.g., “When
pursuing this goal, I get excited about the possibility of success”), Approach-Maintenance (e.g.,
“I am trying to keep my life as ideal as it now”) and Avoidance (e.g., “I am trying to improve my
poor performance”) motivation of general goals were measured using a 13-item scale.
Participants rate their agreement with a 7-point scale (1 = completely disagree, 7 = completely
agree).
Affect (12-Point Affect Circumplex; Yik et al., 2011). Using nine selected items from
the 12-Point Affect Circumplex, three goal-related affects were measured: Pleasure Activation,
Deactivated Pleasure, and Activated Displeasure. For Pleasure Activation, the following items
were used: “I felt alive and active”, “I felt full of energy”, and “Right then, I was brimming with
vigor”. For Deactivated Pleasure, the items “My mind was soothed and unperturbed”, “My mind
was pleasantly at ease” and “My mind was at peace with the world” were used. For Activated
Displeasure, the items “I felt guilty about something that I had said or done”, “I felt ashamed of
myself” and “I felt distressed” were used. Participants used the same 5-point agreement scale.
Brief Inventory of Thriving (Su et al., 2014). Individual differences in wellbeing were
measured using a 10-item scale related to a wide range of wellbeing constructs, such as self-
efficacy (e.g., “I can succeed if I put my mind to it”), self-worth (e.g., “What I do in life is
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
valuable and worthwhile”), meaning (e.g., “My life has a clear sense of purpose”) and optimism
(e.g., “I am optimistic about my future”). Participants used the same 5-point agreement scale.
Procedure
Participants were recruited via Positly. After the consent form, participants were
instructed to think of goals as any desired state that can inform their behavior. As in Study 1,
participants were prompted to think and write about a specific goal with a specific time
perspective concerning achievement (“today”, “this month or “in your life”/“this year”),
difficulty (“hard” or “easy”) and progress (“Accomplished”, “In progress”, “Didn’t start it yet”
or “Gave up”), varying between participants according to randomly assigned conditions. Next,
participants were asked to write about their reason for pursuing this goal. After that, participants
answered single-item self-report measures of goal stage, difficulty, estimated time to accomplish,
when they set this goal, progress, and likelihood of achievement. Then, participants answered the
external measures in the following order: 12-PAC, GCQ, Commitment, PPA, RAC, Necessity
from Goal Striving Reasons, GAMMA, and BIT scales. The order of items was randomized
intra-scale. Finally, participants received a short feedback about their mean scores of the
Specificity, Value Congruence, Challenge, and Define Subgoals, and a brief explanation about
how this knowledge may help them achieve their goal. This study has been approved by the
{masked for review}.
Data Analysis
In order to assess the validity of the prompts, differences in self-report measures of goal
difficulty, time perspective, and goal progress across conditions were measured. As in Study 1,
both a data-driven and a theoretical approach to assess the dimensionality of the GCQ were used.
Hypothesized models were modified according to EGA results and compared with alternative
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
models. In order to test latent mean differences across conditions, we investigated the scalar
invariance of each subscale. In order to access the evidence of validity based on the relation with
other variables, the correlation according to the expected relationships of the GCQ factors with
incremental variance explained of commitment and well-being. Due to the ordinal nature of the
scale, a diagonally weighted least squares estimator for all models (Li, 2016) was used. Raw data
is available at Authors (2021; see references for full link).
Results
This section first presents the comparison of fit between different factor structures, the
loading coefficients, and reliability for each subscale's final version. Subsequently, evidence of
measurement invariance and effects of the conditions could be shown. Most importantly, the
validity of the GCQ by testing the predicted correlations between the various goal characteristics
and external measures of related constructs and internal measures of other goal characteristics
could be demonstrated. Finally, it was shown that the GCQ factors explain additional variance in
Commitment, and above and beyond, the variance explained by another measure of various goal
characteristics, namely the Personal Project Analysis (PPA) method.
Factor Structure
(e.g., Interestingness Subscale, CFI = .87, TLI = .86, RMSEA = .17, SRMR = .15; Bentler,
1990), especially for the subscales where new factors were included. In order to increase the fit,
items were excluded based on their low loadings (< .40), inconsistency between EGA solution
and theoretical model, and item error covariance. Final factor structures for each subscale have
shown a good fit to the data (CFI ≥ .95, TLI ≥ .94, RMSEA ≤ .10, SRMR ≤ .08).

Effects of Conditions
Before comparing factor scores between conditions, configural, metric, and scalar
invariance were tested across different time perspectives, difficulty, and progress independently
with the same method described in Study 1. For all subscales, fit indices did not decrease above
thresholds of ΔCFI > -.01, ΔRMSEA > 0.15 and ΔSRMR > 0.15 (Chen, 2007; Cheung &
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
Rensvold, 2002), suggesting scalar invariance across time perspectives, difficulty and progress
for all subscales. For detailed fit indices, see Supplementary Material.
Since the conditions elicit goals with a specific time perspective, difficulty, and progress,
statistically significant direct effects of the conditions, indicating that goal characteristics vary
across different progress levels, time perspectives, and difficulty levels. No interaction effect was
significant, indicating general independence of the conditions. Univariate effects were not the
primary goal of this paper. Post-hoc analyses for the effect of the conditions on individual GCQ
factors are reported in the Supplementary Material.

Commitment and Thriving Variance Explained
To assess the incremental variance explained by the GCQ to previous measures, the
variance of Commitment and Thriving that is explained by the PPA and the GCQ, were
compared using a path analysis. For GCQ factors, scores were calculated based on the CFA using
the Empirical Bayes Modal method (Morris, 1983). It was found that the PPA alone explains
50.2% of Commitment and 37.7% of Thriving, while the GCQ alone explains 74.7% variance of
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
Commitment and 47.6% variance of Thriving. Together both instruments explain 78.7% variance
of Commitment and 54.6% of Thriving. Therefore, the GCQ increases the ability to explain both
commitment and well-being when compared to the most comprehensive measure previously
used in the literature.
Discussion
The main goal of this study was to provide evidence for convergent validity by testing a
set of hypotheses about correlations of GCQ dimensions with dimensions of external measures.
From the 96 hypotheses, 82 (85%) were confirmed. A great part of unconfirmed hypotheses
(42%) was related to affective constructs, which points at the complex relationships between
goal-related constructs and affect that might have not been captured in this study. In sum, Study
2 demonstrates solid evidence for convergent validity, showing that the GCQ factors align with
established motivational constructs and commitment.
General Discussion
The Goal Characteristics Questionnaire was developed to integrate dimensions from
established goal characteristics measures and goal-relevant characteristics that have not
systematically been measured before. Based on previous research, the systematic development
procedure led to a final version of the measure with six subscales measuring 32 factors with 187
items, which is now ready to be used by the scientific community of motivation researchers.
We have demonstrated that the Goal Characteristics Questionnaire is a valid measure of
the constructs it is supposed to measure according to the following criteria of the APA Standards
for Educational and Psychological Testing (AERA, APA, NCME, 2014):
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
1. Evidence of validity based on test content was established through the initial scale
construction. The item generation process built upon previous findings and wordings
from existing measures were adapted. The semantics were constructed upon relevant
constructs and operationalizations of former research. In addition, theoretically
ambiguous items were excluded through an item-sort task. In the following iterations
of scale refinement, the items were reformulated, new items added, and older items
replaced by experts to adequately represent the constructs to be measured. This
process converged into an item set that covers a wide range of essential goal
characteristics space.
2. Evidence of validity based on response processes was established through an
elicitation procedure, which explicitly evoked goals with different characteristics in
distinct progress, time perspective, and difficult conditions. For instance, goals
elicited by a prompt asking for a difficult goal resulted in higher scores for the
challenge characteristic.
3. Evidence of validity based on the internal structure was demonstrated in Study 1 and
Study 2. The item-latent-variable correlation and the dimensionality were
demonstrated by comparing different models in confirmatory factor analyses,
including data-driven models. Factors also showed adequate reliability. Moreover, the
final version of the GCQ was invariant across different conditions. Taken together,
these results suggest the GCQ is a robust measure for different goals regardless of
how much progress the person already invested in, the time window associated with
this goal, and its difficulty.
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
4. Evidence of validity based on relations to other variables was demonstrated in Study
2, based on correlations with external measures. The findings show that the latent
variables measured by the GCQ highly correlate with latent variables measured by a
broad range of other well-established measures used in motivation and goal-setting
research.
The presented evidence of validity is a solid foundation for the practical application of
the GCQ. Future research, especially longitudinal studies, should expand on this foundation and
improve the GCQ towards predicting sustained commitment and actual performance.
Limitations
Some readers may have missed some characteristics, such as intrinsic and extrinsic goals,
mastery and performance goals, or proximal and distal goals. The aforementioned characteristics
were excluded because the intrinsic-extrinsic continuum is a complex multidimensional
construct in itself that is, in our view, best considered part of a motivational process. The
mastery-performance dimension is specific to educational contexts and is related to the reference
frame for evaluating goal success. While mastery goals are about achieving a skill or mastering a
task, performance goals are about performing well compared to others. This dichotomy has been
extended to a trichotomy of reference frames: task (related to a specific external challenge), self
(related to one’s own past performance), or the performance of others. As the mastery-
performance dichotomy has been outdated by the 3x2 model of achievement goals (see
Murayama & Elliot 2019), a trichotomy on a nominal scale cannot be captured as a single
characteristic on an ordinal scale level. It remains an open question how to integrate this concept
into the GCQ. A separation into more than one dimension is a possibility that needs to be
empirically investigated.
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
The continuum between proximal and distal goals frequently used in the literature (e.g.,
Locke & Latham, 2002) is not covered as a goal characteristic because the operationalization is
context-dependent. Passing an exam may be a proximal goal in the context of career planning
but a distal goal in the context of semester planning. Researchers can simply do a proper
operationalization by asking for specific temporal horizons.
It is important to note that, due to the nature of self-report measures, the
operationalization of the measures is intended to reflect the subjective perception of a personal
goal. The GCQ does not measure objective goal characteristics, so the same goal may be yield
different goal characteristics by different persons and the characteristics assigned by the same
person may develop over time.
Future Directions
With the GCQ, researchers can use context independent goal-related measures. For
instance, the effects of goal-setting interventions can be systematically compared to each other,
and a broad range of goal characteristics can be assessed with only one coherent framework. The
use of a standard measure makes it easier to directly compare results from different studies. The
GCQ, with its broad scope, has the potential to simplify the collection of standardized data about
goals in a time when making study data publicly available is becoming part of good scientific
practice. These examples are just a subset of the new methodological possibilities the GCQ
provides for the scientific community.
The predictive power of goal characteristics over goal setting outcomes, such as goal
progress, achievement, and well-being, can be investigated in longitudinal studies. The
predictive power of specific characteristics might depend on the context or person’s trait. As a
GOAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE
consequence, interventions should also investigate individual differences in order to personalize
and optimize their effects.
Prediction of Other Goal-Related Constructs
The full potential of the GCQ for motivation and goal setting science remains to be
unfolded: some of the goal characteristics that are not explicitly part of the current GCQ might
be concluded based on a combination of covered characteristics. Correlations between goal
characteristics and the probability of goal achievement, for instance, are a promising and
worthwhile field of investigation. If the GCQ could be used to make good predictions about the
probability of goal achievement, this may help to simplify study designs and reduce temporal
effort of goal setting studies substantially. As the field of goal setting research progresses
rapidly, new relevant goal characteristics may be identified and integrated or built upon the
contained characteristics. Its multidimensional structure makes the GCQ a solid foundation for
this kind of extension.
Conclusion
This paper has introduced a new and more comprehensive measure for goal
characteristics, which integrates objective, valid, and reliable measures of 32 constructs of great
relevance for motivation research into a single framework and overcomes many methodological
and conceptual limitations of previous operationalizations. Two studies have demonstrated the
evidences of validity of the GCQ based on the Standards for Educational and Psychological
Testing (AERA, APA, NCME, 2014). Its application has the potential to encourage motivation
researchers to systematize and evaluate goal characteristics measures, elucidate previously
overlooked effects of known interventions and to investigate the causes and consequences of
goal characteristics across different contexts.
