Abstract
The number of databases that provide various measurements of lexical properties for
psycholinguistic research has increased rapidly in recent years. The proliferation of lexical variables, and the
multitude of associated databases, makes the choice, comparison, and standardization of these variables in
psycholinguistic research increasingly difficult. Here, we introduce The South Carolina Psycholinguistic
Metabase (SCOPE), which is a metabase (or a meta-database) containing an extensive, curated collection of
psycholinguistic variable values from major databases. The metabase currently contains 245 lexical
variables, organized into seven major categories: General (e.g., frequency), Orthographic (e.g., bigram
frequency), Phonological (e.g., phonological uniqueness point), Orth-Phon (e.g., consistency), Semantic
(e.g., concreteness), Morphological (e.g., number of morphemes) and Response variables (e.g., lexical
decision latency). We hope that SCOPE will become a valuable resource for researchers in psycholinguistics
and affiliated disciplines such as cognitive neuroscience of language, computational linguistics, and
communication disorders. The availability and ease of use of the metabase with comprehensive set of
variables can facilitate the understanding of the unique contribution of each of the variables to word
processing, and that of interactions between variables, as well as new insights and development of improved
models and theories of word processing. It can also help standardize practice in psycholinguistics. We
demonstrate use of the metabase by measuring relationships between variables in multiple ways and testing
their individual contribution towards a number of dependent measures, in the most comprehensive analysis
of this kind to date. The metabase is freely available at go.sc.edu/scope.

SCOPE: The South Carolina Psycholinguistic Metabase
How words are processed is a central question in psycholinguistics and cognitive science in general.
A rich body of research has addressed this question using behavioral studies, most commonly using lexical
decision and word naming tasks. This has provided valuable insights into properties that affect word
processing, shedding light on mechanisms behind both visual and auditory word processing. In the last 15
years, large scale studies (“megastudies”), often including tens of thousands of words, have greatly boosted
this research. For example, the English Lexicon Project (ELP) provides measures of both visual lexical
decision and speeded naming tasks for over 40,000 words, along with numerous psycholinguistic properties
(Balota et al., 2007). Other megastudies provide data for visual lexical decision of British English (Keuleers
et al., 2012), auditory lexical decision (Goh et al., 2020; Tucker et al., 2019), and semantic decision
(Pexman et al., 2017). Instead of relying on a small sample of carefully chosen words that may be
idiosyncratic in some fashion, these studies enable development and testing of potentially more robust word
processing models on a larger scale. At the same time, the number of studies that measure word properties
by collecting ratings on psycholinguistic variables for thousands of words has also increased rapidly (Taylor
et al., 2020), providing rich and robust measures of many lexical properties (e.g., Brysbaert et al., 2014;
Lynott et al., 2020; Pexman et al., 2019; Scott et al., 2019).
A welcome result of this work is an extensive and ever-increasing list of psycholinguistic variables
that are found to affect, to varying extents, how words are processed. When investigating the contribution of
a particular variable, researchers control for effects of other variables that are deemed to be standard control
variables. However, what is considered “standard” often differs significantly between studies. Typically, a
handful of variables such as frequency, number of letters or phonemes, and imageability or concreteness are
used, in addition to a few other variables that vary. However, the number of psycholinguistic variables
known to affect word processing is much larger. The justification for using a particular set of variables is
often not clear. Investigators’ research interest and expertise are understandably important factors in the
choice, as well as convenience or ease of obtaining values for these variables. With the proliferation of
megastudies that provide ratings on myriad of variables, it is increasingly difficult to identify and obtain
values for all potentially relevant variables. This is because these variables are often spread across many
datasets, most of which provide ratings for partially different sets of words. Some databases also contain
values for multiple senses of the same word forms (e.g., Scott et al., 2019).
Moreover, in some cases, a nominally single variable has several subtlety different versions. For
example, word frequency has well over a dozen measures. Many other variables, such as affective ratings or
imageability also have multiple measures available. The contribution of different versions of a variable to a
dependent variable is likely different (Brysbaert & New, 2009). Investigators often use a particular version
of a variable that is familiar, or customary in their lab. For example, one lab may often use the
log_Freq_HAL variable from the ELP as frequency measure as a convention or habit, while another may use
log_SUBTLEX as standard practice. Ideally, this choice should be driven by a systematic comparison
between different versions taking into account factors such as variances explained by a particular version of
a variable, differences of tasks instructions, goals of the study, and dependent measures of interest.
To overcome these challenges in psycholinguistic research, we introduce a new meta-database or
metabase named SCOPE (South CarOlina Psycholingusitic mEtabase). It aims to provide the most
comprehensive collection of variables to date, by integrating megastudies and other major databases in the
form of a curated metabase. It also contains additional variables for both words and nonwords not found in
other databases. We have attempted to be extensive in our coverage, while acknowledging that the number
of possible lexical variables is virtually unlimited. No database can be truly comprehensive, because new
variables are being proposed and measured all the time, but we hope to update the metabase periodically to
include new variables. Our hope is that this metabase will be, for many cases, a “one stop shop” for
psycholinguistics and for affiliated disciplines such as cognitive neuroscience of language, computational
linguistics, and communication disorders. Ease of use and availability may enhance incorporation of many
of the provided variables in psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic studies, potentially leading to faster
progress.
Our aims are threefold. First, we expect that the metabase will enable a more comprehensive
examination of word processing, which will result in a better understanding of the unique contribution of
each of the variables and their interactions. It may promote development of improved models and theories of
word and language processing and a better exchange of insights from different facets of language research,
such as reading, speech perception, and semantics. Second, we hope that such a metabase will help
standardize practice in psycholinguistics and will lead to a wider agreement over which variables, and which
versions of those variables, are the most informative and should be routinely used or controlled for in
different contexts. Finally, we present a preliminary analysis that measures the relationship between a large
subset of the variables, and their individual contributions to several dependent variables, in the most
comprehensive analysis of this type to date.
The variables in the metabase are organized in seven groups. The first group, “General”, contains
variables that have elements of orthography, phonology, and semantics, and are often strongly predictive of
word processing performance. Variables such as frequency and age-of-acquisition are contained in this
group. Three groups correspond to major components of a lexical item: “Orthographic”, “Phonological” and
“Semantis”. A fifth group, “Orth-Phon”, contains variables that represent the relationship between
orthography and phonology. A sixth group is “Morphology,” which contains variables such as length of
morpheme and morpheme frequency. Finally, the seventh group contains “Response” variables represented
by mean response times and accuracies. In addition to words, the database also contains orthographic and
phonological measures as well as dependent measures, when available, for some pseudowords and
nonwords.
We describe the distribution of each of the variables, and the relationship between each of the
independent variables and the dependent variables. The metabase contains 245 variables (some of which are
multi-dimensional) and a total of 105,992 words and 81,934 nonwords in the current version, with varying
number of variable values available for each item. Finally, with each variable, we provide associated
information such as the definition and the citation of its source that should be used when that variable is
included in a study, as it is essential to credit the original creators of these databases.

Sem_Diversity
The degree to which different contexts associated with a word vary in their meanings. In other
words, similarity of different contexts in which a word can appear. This is a computationally derived
measure of semantic ambiguity, which is more objective compared to the measure by summing the number
of senses or dictionary definitions (Hoffman et al., 2013).
Sem_N
The number of semantic neighbors within a threshold determined in a co-occurrence space. The
space was created from a sparse matrix that contains all co-occurrence information for each word with
window size and weighting scheme applied. The threshold is calculated by randomly sampling many word
pairs and calculating their interword distances to obtain the mean and standard deviation of this distance
distribution (Shaoul & Westbury, 2006, 2010). The threshold was 1.5 SDs below the mean distance.

sample, which provides a relative index of the set size of a particular word by providing a reliable measure
of how many strong associates it has (Nelson et al., 2004).

The number of connections among the associate set of a word, divided by the size of the set, which
captures the density and in some sense the level of organization among the strongest associates of the cue
(Nelson et al., 2004).

The probability that each associate in a set produces the normed cue as an associate (Nelson et al.,
2004).

performed on aggregated global word-word co-occurrence statistics from a corpus (Pennington et al., 2014).
Taxonomic [300]
Vector representation of a word created from a model that uses a narrow window of co-occurrence,
effectively emphasizing taxonomic similarities between words as opposed to associations (Roller & Erk,
2016). In most distributional models, words such as cow and milk have similar representations due to their
high association, while the distance between cow and bull is relatively greater. These representations reverse
this relationship, and assign a greater similarity to cow and bull.
Orth-Phon Variables

consistency (Chee et al., 2020).

(Mandera et al., 2019). This task is similar, but not identical, to the traditional lexical decision task.
Participants were asked to indicate whether each item “is a word you know or not.” Their results showed
that RTs in this task correlate well with those from lexical decision in ELP and BLP, and hence we have
labelled it as such. It should be noted that in this task, participants were not instructed to respond quickly,
and were discouraged to guess (large penalty for labelling a nonword as a known word).

LexicalD_RT_V_BLP_z
LexicalD_ACC_V_BLP
The mean visual lexical decision latency (in msec) and its normalized version, and the proportion of

particular word from the Calgary database (Pexman et al., 2017).
Recog_Memory
Recognition memory performance indicated by d’ (hits minus false alarms) (Khanna & Cortese,
2021).
Data Analyses
As an initial effort, we examined the relationship between independent variables and reported the
correlations between independent and dependent variables. We aimed to include the largest number of
variables over the maximum number of words. Because variable values are available for partially different
sets of words, including more variables leads to a smaller set of words, and selecting a larger set of words
leads to a smaller variable set. As a compromise between these competing factors, we created a subset of the
data containing 1,728 words with measurements on 130 independent variables (28 General, 17
Orthographic, 17 Phonological, 38 Semantic, 26 Orth-Phon, 4 Morphological) and 13 response variables (3
visual lexical decision reaction times, 3 visual lexical decision accuracies, 2 auditory lexical decision times,
2 auditory lexical decision accuracies, 1 naming time, 1 naming accuracy, and 1 recognition memory). To
create this subset, we excluded variables that are available for relatively small sets of words or those that
have low overlap with other variables (in terms of the words that the values are available for; e.g.,
NFeatures, Feature_Perceptual, Emot_Assoc), are categorical (i.e., DPoS_Brys, DPoS_VanH, and
First_Phon), or are in a vector form (e.g., Word2vec).
Interrelations Between Variables
Spearman’s Correlation Between Variables
To summarize the description of the relationship between each of the independent variables, we
computed the Spearman’s correlation among the 130 independent variables and created a similarity plot
using these correlations.
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
We also examined the interrelations between variables with t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor
Embedding (t-SNE) and hierarchical cluster analyses. Barnes-Hut t-SNE (perplexity = 30; theta = 0) was
used to visualize high-dimensional data. This method converts high-dimensional Euclidean distances
between variables into conditional probabilities and then projects these distances onto a two-dimensional
embedding space using the Student-t distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence. It has the
advantage of revealing global structure while also capturing local structure of the high-dimensional data
(Van der Maaten & Hinton, 2008).
Hierarchical Cluster Analysis
As an additional method of visualizing clustering among independent variables, hierarchical cluster
analysis was performed using Ward’s criterion (Murtagh & Legendre, 2014).
Exploratory Factor Analysis
A parallel analysis was performed to determine the appropriate number of latent factors (Crawford et
al., 2010; Horn, 1965). The exploratory factor analysis was performed using the principal axis factoring
extraction method and oblimin rotation.
Network Analysis
To further determine the interrelations between variables, we performed a psychometric network
modeling analysis in which each observed variable was modelled as a node and partial correlations among
variables were modelled as edges (Epskamp et al., 2018; Epskamp & Fried, 2018). Three centrality indices
were computed to examine the relative importance of a node in the network: strength, closeness and
betweenness. Strength refers to the sum of absolute partial correlation values for each node. Closeness refers
to the inverse of the sum of distances from one node in the network to all other nodes. Betweenness refers to
the number of the shortest paths that one node was passed through. A “best” measure of each individual
variable group, defined as the measure that has the highest overall weighted correlation with dependent
measures, was chosen to represent the group in the network analysis (e.g., CD_SUBTLEXUS for all
contextual diversity measures). This ensures that that centrality indices are not biased towards one particular
variable because of the unequal number of measures (e.g., having many frequency measures but few age-of-
acquisition measures).
Correlations Between Variables/Factors and the Dependent Variables
In addition to the analyses on the dataset that excluded the semantic decision task (n=1,728), we also
performed analyses for correlations between variables/factors and the dependent variables after including
semantic decision (SemanticD_RT_Calgary), resulting in n=471 words.
Correlations Between Each Independent Variable and the Dependent Variables
To examine bivariate relationships between the dependent and independent variables, normalized
reaction time measures (zRTs) for each of 7 dependent variables (i.e., LexicalD_RT_V_ELP_z,
LexicalD_RT_V_ECP_z, LexicalD_RT_V_BLP_z, LexicalD_RT_A_MALD_z, LexicalD_RT_A_AELP_z,
Naming_RT_ELP_z, and Recog_Memory) were correlated with each of the 130 variables over 1,728 words
using Spearman’s correlation. In addition to correlations between independent variables and each of the
dependent variables separately, we also computed an overall weighted absolute correlation that gives equal
weight to each task (visual lexical decision, auditory lexical decision, naming, and recognition memory), so
that the overall value is not dominated by tasks such as visual lexical decision that have multiple measures.
It was computed using Spearman’s R for each measure as [(visual lexical decision R of ELP + visual lexical
decision R of ECP + visual lexical decision R of BLP)/3 + (auditory lexical decision R of MALD + auditory
lexical decision R of AELP)/2 + naming R + recognition memory R]/4. A similar weighted absolute
correlation was computed for the smaller dataset (n=471) that included semantic decision times, using five
different tasks. We also provide ranks of different measures for each variable (e.g., frequency) by overall
weighted correlation or correlation values for response variables from each dataset (e.g., ELP, ECP etc). The
measure of each independent variable that has the highest overall weighted correlation was chosen for the
network analysis.
Correlations Between Each Factor and the Dependent Variables
We also performed Spearman’s correlation between factor scores of each factor obtained from the
exploratory factor analysis, and normalized reaction time measures (zRTs) for each of 7 dependent variables
(i.e., LexicalD_RT_V_ELP_z, LexicalD_RT_V_ECP_z, LexicalD_RT_V_BLP_z,
LexicalD_RT_A_MALD_z, LexicalD_RT_A_AELP_z, Naming_RT_ELP_z, and Recog_Memory).
Contributions of Distributional Semantic Vectors to the Dependent Variables
We also performed multiple regression analyses with three distribution semantic vectors (Word2Vec,
GloVe, and Taxonomic) as predictors and each of the 7 dependent variables as response variables. Adjusted
multiple R was obtained from each of the multiple regression analyses for comparison with correlation
values of other variables. Overall weighted R for the distributional semantic vectors was computed in a
similar way as for other independent variables.
Correlations Between Each Independent Variable and Dependent Variables for Nonwords
To further examine the bivariate relationships between the dependent and independent variables, we
also correlated normalized reaction time measures (zRTs) of nonwords for LexicalD_RT_V_ELP_z,
LexicalD_RT_V_BLP_z, LexicalD_RT_A_MALD_z with a set of independent variables. These variables
include NLett, Orth_N, OLD20, OUP, Orth_Spread obtained using LexiCAL (Chee et al., 2021); and
UnigramF_Avg_C_Log, BigramF_Avg_C_Log, TrigramF_Avg_C_Log, UnigramF_Avg_U_Log,
BigramF_Avg_U_Log, and TrigramF_Avg_U_Log retrieved from MCWord database (Medler & Binder,
2005). Given that IPA transcription is available for AELP database (Goh et al., 2020), we were able to
compute additional measures including NPhon, NSyll, PLD20, PUP, Phon_Spread, and Phonographic_N
using LexiCAL for AELP. We then correlated these measures with reaction time measure of nonwords for
LexicalD_RT_A_AELP.
To compare the correlations between reaction time measures and independent variables across
databases, we merged across databases and compared the databases that have a reasonable sample size of
overlapping nonwords. This resulted in 1,292 nonwords shared between ELP and BLP, 480 nonwords
shared between ELP and AELP, and 574 nonwords shared between AELP and BLP.
Results
for all available words for that variable is shown separately for each of the seven groups (i.e., General, Orthographic,
across the whole range. Compared to constrained unigram, bigram, or trigram frequencies, values for the
unconstrained versions of frequency measures were more distributed. The concreteness measures had relatively
uniform distributions. The measures of reaction times generally had skewed distributions as expected. The accuracies
were generally very high.

Interrelations Between Variables
Spearman’s Correlations Between Variables
clusters can be identified from this visualization. The largest cluster included a series of frequency measures such as
those from SUBTLEX, CELEX, HAL and Worldlex databases; cumulative frequency; semantic neighbourhood
measures; association frequency measures and familiarity. The second cluster included orthographic neighbourhood
measures, phonological neighbourhood measures, frequencies for the orthographic and phonological neighbours,
orthographic, phonological and phonographic neighbourhood measures, as well as orthographic and phonological
spread measures. The third cluster included length and uniqueness-related variables, such as the number of letters,
number of syllables, number of phonemes, number of morphemes, orthographic and phonological Levenshtein
distances, orthographic and phonological uniqueness point, and age of acquisition measures. The fourth cluster
included a series of positional probability measures, biphon and triphon probability measures. The fifth cluster
included sensory and motor semantic variables, including visual features, haptic features, Minkowski perceptual
strength, imageability, concreteness, and strength of experiences with hand/arm. The last cluster as also semantic, and
included strength of experiences with head or mouth/throat, auditory feature, interoceptive feature, arousal, and
number of variables).

1 (blue) to 1 (pink).
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
Variable groupings based on t-SNE visualization partially followed our categorical assignments
and frequency trajectory) forming a distinct cluster. Orthographic variables also clustered together, with
those related to unconstrained and constrained ngrams forming a different cluster. Phonological variables
formed two categories, with one related to neighbourhood measures, while the other mainly related to
phonotactic variables and length. Semantic variables were spread out and formed three clusters, with the
largest cluster, with sensory-motor and affective features, occupying the centre of the space. A second
cluster was related to semantic neighbourhood measures, while the third was related to the frequency of the
associates. Though Orth-Phon variables were mostly related to consistency, they were still relatively spread
out, suggesting that different aspects of consistency capture different properties, and should not be treated in
a unitary manner.
over 1,728 words. Colors indicate six theoretically defined groups (i.e., General, Orthographic,
Phonological, Semantic, Orth-Phon, Morphological).
Hierarchical Cluster Analysis
visualization is useful for identifying within- and between-category similarities. For example, some
semantic variables clustered with General variables, while others with Phonological and Orthographic
variables.

Network Analysis
The network analysis showed that the clusters partially reflected the theoretically defined groups:
features were especially distributed. While sensory-motor semantic features and concreteness cluster
together, other semantic groups representing semantic neighborhood, affect, and polysemy were distinct
from them as well as from each other. Overall, morphological frequency and orthographic length were the
was the variable most close to other nodes in the network and a hub that other variables passed through.
Contextual diversity, frequency and age of acquisition were also among the variables that had strong
connections with other variables. We also performed network analyses on the data after including semantic
decision with n=471 words. The psychometric network model and centrality indices for these analyses are
provided in Supplemental Figures 12 and 13.

Overall, General variables had the largest correlation with visual and auditory lexical decision
reaction times. Contextual diversity, along with frequency measures, were overall the most significant
predictors. Association frequency measures were also among the most significant predictors, especially for
visual and auditory lexical decision tasks. Overall, auditory lexical decision correlations were much lower
than those of other measures. Age of acquisition and familiarity were near the top for auditory lexical
decision, differentiating this task from other measures.
A subgroup of Semantic variables was the next most informative overall, followed by several
Orthographic and a few Phonological variables. Orth-Phon variables, as a group, were the least informative
on average. However, we note that more emphasis was given to lexical decision tasks (due to the presence
of both visual and auditory lexical decision), whereas Orth-Phon variables were relevant especially for
naming. Indeed, they showed much higher correlation in the naming task, but still lagged behind several
General, Semantic, and Orthographic variables. Naming was the only task where Orthographic variables
was differentiated by the fact that semantic diversity and imageability/concreteness were the top predictors,
measures, lemma frequencies were found to be more predictive than wordform frequencies for recognition
memory.
For the 471 words when semantic decision was included, the results for lexical decision reaction
times and naming latencies were generally consistent with previous findings with the larger subset of words
somewhat due to the inclusion of the semantic decision task. The strongest predictors for semantic decision
were Semantic and General variables such as concreteness/imageability, and age of acquisition measures. In
contrast to other measures, frequency and contextual diversity were ranked relatively lower for semantic
dependent variables including Semantic Decision, as well as rankings, over 471 words.

Contributions of Distributional Semantic Vectors to the Dependent Variables
The multiple regression analyses with three distribution semantic vectors (Word2Vec, GloVe, and

overall weighted values of adjusted multiple R were 0.481 for Word2Vec, 0.484 for GloVe, and 0.462 for

Discussion and Conclusion
We presented a curated integration of psycholinguistic databases in the form of a metabase, to create
the most comprehensive psycholinguistic database to date. The metabase is accompanied by a web interface
or generate words/nonwords based on variable values within a range. Our primary goal here was to present
the database, rather than answer any specific psycholinguistic questions. Nonetheless, we present some
observations from the preliminary analyses below. We conducted two kinds of analyses, one examining the
organization or clustering within the variables, and the second related to the correlation between dependent
and independent variables.
The analyses on the interrelations between a large set of variables showed that variable groupings
were generally consistent with theoretical categories (General, Orthographic, Phonological, Semantic, Orth-
Phon, Morphological). Variables within the same categorical assignment (e.g., General) were more likely to
group together, as expected. Among the clusters, the analyses consistently showed that semantic variables
were relatively more spread out than general, orthographic or phonological variables. This is not surprising
given that variables related to semantics are generally more complex and subjective (defined by observer,
e.g., valence of a word), compared to general, orthographic or phonological variables (defined by wordforms
themselves, e.g., orthographic length of a word). Moreover, network analyses indicate that even different
types of semantic variables – sensory/perceptual, affect, polysemy and semantic neighborhood related – are
distinct in their characteristics and do not cluster together.
The network analyses showed that morphological frequency and orthographic length were the
variables that most strongly connected to other variables. These findings are consistent with previous
evidence suggesting importance of morphology in the representation of the lexicon (Caramazza et al., 1988;
Kuperman et al., 2008). Orthographic length is well-known to have an effect at an early temporal stage of
word processing (Hauk et al., 2006), which suggests it may influence other cognitive processes. In addition,
we found phonographic neighborhood was the variable most close to other nodes in the network. As a
combination of orthographic and phonological neighborhoods (Peereman & Content, 1997), it is suggested
to be more important in lexical representations compared to orthographic neighborhood (Adelman & Brown,
2007). Our results demonstrated a central role of phonographic neighborhood that connects orthographic and
phonological neighborhood variables. At the other end, affect was found to have low strength, low
betweenness, and low closeness. Thus, affective attributes of words appear to be captured by other variables
in the network, at least for the Warriner et al. (2013) measure that was selected.
The analyses on the correlations between variables/clusters and the dependent variables showed that
overall contextual diversity and frequency variables had the largest correlation with the dependent variables.
This replicates many previous results (Adelman et al., 2006; Brysbaert et al., 2018; Monsell et al., 1989), but
on an unprecedented scale in terms of the number of dependent and independent variables examined.
Overall, CD/frequency, association frequency, AoA, and taxonomic semantic neighborhood were the
strongest factors across tasks.
The changes in the ranking and correlation of variables due to the change in dependent variable are
instructive. The CD/frequency factor is far and away the strongest predictor for the visual lexical decision
task. This indicates the importance of exposure and familiarity of the surface from for visual lexical
decision. For auditory lexical decision, the results are very different, in that overall correlations are much
lower. Not many variables other than CD/frequency, AoA, and association frequency have strong
correlations for auditory lexical decision. There are also significant differences between AELP and MALD,
with MALD correlations being especially weak. For naming, no one variable or factor dominates.
CD/frequency, association frequency, orthographic neighborhood and Orth-Phon variables have very similar
strengths. This is consistent with previous evidence that demonstrated the importance of phonographic
variables in naming (Adelman & Brown, 2007).
For recognition memory and semantic decision, semantic factors come to the fore.
Concreteness/imageability and taxonomic semantic neighborhood were the strongest for recognition
memory. Coding of items in memory is strongly reliant not just on being able to form an image of the item,
but also on the number of (taxonomically) similar items. For semantic decision, concreteness/imageability is
the strongest factor by far, and nothing else comes close. The second most important factor of association
frequency has less than half the correlation compared to concreteness/imageability, which is noteworthy
even given the fact that semantic decision task explicitly required judging concreteness (Pexman et al.,
2017). In contrast to the memory task, the semantic neighborhood factor has a somewhat lower correlation
for semantic decision. For a semantic task, the sensory features of the item itself are primarily relevant, and
the effects of spreading activation in a semantic neighborhood come into play only in the context of a
memory task. As opposed to the lexical decision and naming tasks, CD/frequency has a significant but much
lower importance for both memory and semantic decision tasks, setting up a contrast between the value of
exposure to the surface form vs. access to sensory features. Perhaps surprisingly, the gustatory/olfactory
semantic factor had strong correlation with recognition memory and semantic decision, but with no other
tasks. On the other hand, both association frequency and AoA strongly predicted all tasks except recognition
memory. These results underscore the fact that these tasks, including visual and auditory lexical decision,
rely on significantly different psycholinguistic processes, and are not interchangeable. No one task can be
taken as a standard index of “word processing.”
Among consistency variables, the feedforward onset consistency was the most correlated with
dependent measures, with a strong correlation with not only for visual lexical decision and naming tasks, but
also for semantic decision. This can be related to the debate between single- vs. dual-pathway models of
reading (Seidenberg, 2012). The single-system view has argued that a semantic pathway is used to read
inconsistent words, and the ability for consistency to predict semantic (concreteness) decision times appears
to support this view.
We especially draw attention to the taxonomic semantic neighborhood factor, introduced by Reilly &
Desai (2017), which is novel to SCOPE and has been rarely used in psycholinguistic research. It had a
strong correlation with all dependent measures, with the exception of auditory lexical decision tasks. It was
the second strongest variable predicting recognition memory. Association frequency is another factor that
had strong correlations with all tasks, but is not commonly used. These results suggest that these two
variables can become part of a standard set of psycholinguistic covariates, along with popular variables such
as frequency, length, concreteness/imageability, and age of acquisition.
We found that the distributed semantic vectors consistently outperformed all other individual
variables in predicting the dependent variables across visual and auditory lexical decision, naming,
recognition memory, and semantic decision, which is a novel result to our knowledge. Previous studies have
shown that such distributed semantic vectors and can be used to predict human performance in a range of
tasks such as word associations and similarity judgments (Landauer & Dumais, 1997; Pereira et al., 2016).
Our findings highlight the promising aspects of distributional semantic vectors in representing word
meanings. We found that Word2Vec, GloVe and Taxonomic distributional vectors have comparable
performance in predicting a range of tasks. A current debate pertains to the difference between distributional
semantic vectors derived purely from statistical co-occurrence patterns in text corpora, and those derived
from experiential attributes, with respect to capturing underlying semantics of words. Some recent
neuroimaging results suggest an advantage for experience-based vector representations (Fernandino et al.,
2022). Here, we were not able to directly compare distributional vectors to experiential attributes
(Compo_attribs in this database) due to the relatively small size of the latter. A future direction is to increase
the size of the experiential attributes set and compare their ability to predict these behavioral dependent
measures with those of the three distributional vectors.
For nonwords, length and uniqueness points were found to have the highest correlation with
dependent measures. Unigram, trigram, and bigram frequencies followed in their predictive value, with
trigram frequencies ranking high, in contrast to the results for words, where trigram frequencies ranked
lower than bigram and unigram frequencies. High unigram frequency was faciliatory, while high trigram
frequency increased latency. This is consistent with the intuition that word-likeness of nonwords, indexed by
trigram frequency, is an important factor for determining their latencies. Neighborhood measures such as
OLD20 had a weaker but significant effect on nonword processing times. Orthographic spread was
surprisingly found to have no significant correlation with dependent measures, suggesting that this factor
does not play a major role in word processing, even without factoring out covariates such as frequency and
length.
The results (Supplemental Tables 3 and 4) can be used to pick the “best” measures, and select
among alternative measures of a nominally same variable, given the overall weighted correlation as well as
correlation for each dependent variable. For example, we found that frequency measures from Wordlex
(Gimenes & New, 2016) and SUBTLEX (Brysbaert & New, 2009; Van Heuven et al., 2014) datasets had
generally the strongest correlations with dependent variables compared to other frequency measures. We
note that the CELEX (COBUILD) frequencies cluster separately from all other frequency measures when
using any clustering method (t-SNE, hierarchical clustering, or factor analysis) and have lower correlations
with dependent measures. This indicates a qualitative difference in corpus characteristics, and suggests that
other frequency measures may be more suited for psycholinguistic research.
No large differences in the overall weighted correlations across a range of tasks were found between
measures for many variables such as contextual diversity, age of acquisitions, concreteness etc. The
research. For example, picking a representative variable for each factor may be more desirable than picking
an arbitrary or customary set of “standard” variables.
The rankings of the variables obtained in the correlation analyses should be interpreted with caution
for several reasons. First, the precise order can change depending on the specific words selected or the
dependent measure. Nonetheless, we expect that the pattern of relative importance of various factors for
various tasks should remain stable even with different word sets. Second, the contribution of the variables to
dependent measures also depends on how much variance they explain over and above other variables.
Because we only examined each variable in a univariate manner, interactions between variables were not
explored. For example, the frequency × consistency interaction in word naming is well-known (Seidenberg
et al., 1984), where consistency has a low effect for high frequency words, but a strong effect for low
frequency words. Such effects are not seen in the current analyses, resulting in consistency being rated
relatively low, which is arguably misleading with regard to the importance of this variable. Such
theoretically relevant interactions can be explored in future studies. Future studies can also investigate which
cohort of variables explains the most variance as a group, in both linear and nonlinear models. Third,
differences in tasks instructions may affect what an individual variable captures. For example, for
association frequency measures, some studies elicited free associations in the broad possible sense; whereas
some other studies asked participants to give a meaningful response which may affect what responses were
given (see De Deyne et al., 2019 for a discussion; Nelson et al., 2004). Similarly, for concreteness ratings,
some studies emphasize visual properties, while others do not.
While we have attempted to be expansive in coverage of variables that are used in psycholinguistic
research, we have also not replicated all megastudy databases in their entirety. Many of the databases that
we have integrated contain some unique features or variables that are not included here. For example, the
AELP database (Goh et al., 2020) contains multiple auditory recordings of words and nonwords that are not
included here. The Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms (Lynott et al., 2020) provides a number of summary
variables, such as Minkowski 10, Minknowski 3, Summed Strength, and Max Strength. We have only
included the Minkowski 3 measure, as it was found to be the best measure for predicting lexical decision
response times and accuracy. It is conceivable that other summary measures might be useful in other
circumstances. We direct users to the original database for the full set of variables and features, and hope
that SCOPE will serve as a portal for discovery of new and informative variables. We have not included
commercial databases such as CoCA (Corpus of Contemporary American English), which would not allow
free sharing of the data. The metabase is currently restricted to words and nonwords. For example, the
current version does not include picture stimuli that are commonly used in object, verb, famous face, or
landmark naming tasks. SCOPE also does not contain multi-word combination or sentence-level norms, or
norms that pertain to two or more specific words (e.g., association strength between two words). Included
variables are norms that are calculated from the wordform alone, or from the wordform and a dictionary. An
important limitation of the current version is also that the metabase is restricted to English. Future versions
may expand it to other languages.
The data can be freely explored or downloaded from a web interface and search engine
variables, obtain variable values from a given list of words/nonwords, and generate words/nonwords based
on variable values within a range. The back end of the metabase is also designed such that addition of new
variables is not cumbersome, as development of new variables is inevitable. We hope that the ease of use
and continued updates will promote the development of improved psycholinguistic models and facilitate a
better understanding of the contribution of these variables, their interactions, and tasks to processing of
language. We also hope that the metabase will help standardize practice in psycholinguistics and related
disciplines.
