WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 2
Abstract
The amount of money individuals were willing to accept (WTA) to discontinue using
prominent Chinese social media platforms (WeChat/QQ), the willingness to pay (WTP) for
using these platforms, as well as WTA/WTP disparities were investigated in between-groups
and within-subjects design studies to examine their existence, size, and psychological
correlates in the form of personality and social media use habits.
Individuals were recruited at Chinese universities in three separate surveys. For
between-groups investigations, four samples were extracted: WTA and WTP samples for
investigations in the context of WeChat as well as WTA and WTP for QQ. For within-
subjects’ investigations, individuals completed items on WTA and WTP for WeChat/QQ, the
Big Five Inventory, time spent on WeChat/QQ, and the short Bergen Social Media Addiction
Scale. Two samples providing data on WeChat and QQ, respectively, were extracted.
Across study designs and for both WeChat and QQ we found evidence for high WTA
and lower WTP scores, thus, large WTA/WTP disparities. Individual differences in the
disparities were negatively associated with Openness across platforms. The results reveal a
generally low acceptance to pay for social media use, which is important against the
background of discussions on monetary payment models. Moreover, a complex interplay
between individual characteristics, characteristics of the service, and how and why the
service is used seem to underly WTA and the WTA/WTP disparity. Finally, methodological
implications of the present results for forthcoming studies assessing valuation (WTA, WTP)
in the context of social media are discussed.

1. Introduction
To investigate the valuation of a product/service, numerous studies have assessed
individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) for the product/service, and/or their willingness to
accept (WTA; minimum amount of money one needs to be offered to discontinue
using/selling the product/service) (Brown & Gregory, 1999; Sunstein, 2018). Strikingly,
many studies have observed a discrepancy reflected in higher WTA than WTP scores for the
same product/service, also termed the WTA/WTP disparity (Brown & Gregory, 1999;
Horowitz & McConnell, 2002; Tunçel & Hammitt, 2014). The existence of this disparity
contradicts classical economic theories (Willig (1976) as cited in Kahnemann et al., (1990)).
Thus, researchers are keen on understanding what (psychological) mechanisms underly
WTA, WTP, and their disparity. For now, however, the underlying psychology of the
WTA/WTP disparity remains unknown and a topic of discussions (Brown, 2005; Brown &
Gregory, 1999; Morewedge et al., 2009; Morewedge & Giblin, 2015; Tunçel & Hammitt,
2014).
Among others, WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP disparity have been examined in the
context of digital products/services (Fritze et al., 2019; Sunstein, 2018). Only one work,
however, has investigated these variables specifically in the context of social media
(Sunstein, 2018) and found much larger WTA/WTP disparities than previously reported for
any other good (product/service. The examination of WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP
disparity in the realm of social media is of high interest, because the usage of such platforms
constitutes a special context. This is because i) such platforms cannot be owned by an
individual user but only be used, ii) usage of the platforms currently is primarily not paid for
with money, and iii) social media platforms are an integral part of everyday life for many
individuals (We Are Social et al., 2020). Moreover, an investigation of valuation measures
(WTA and specifically WTP) of social media platforms is of special interest because
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 4
monetary payment models as alternatives to the current business model underlying most
social media platforms are debated (Sindermann, Kuss, et al., 2020).
Based on the peculiarities of the social media context and the large WTA/WTP
disparities found in this context before (Sunstein, 2018), we aimed to investigate WTA,
WTP, and the WTA/WTP disparity in the context of social media more in-depth. More
specifically, our work adds to the literature in two important ways: firstly, the present work
replicates the study design by Sunstein (2018) who investigated Western samples and
platforms, by examining Chinese samples and Chinese/Eastern social media platforms.
Thereby, this work tests the robustness of previous findings. Not only does this align with the
objective to overcome issues of non-replicable findings in psychological research; see
problems presented in Open Science Collaboration (2015) and cross-cultural replications as a
solution for the replication crisis as discussed in Montag et al. (2018). Additionally, this
research approach supports overcoming the WEIRD problem psychological research
oftentimes faces: numerous psychological theories and effects are investigated in Western,
Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic samples only (Henrich et al., 2010). Secondly,
going beyond Sunstein's (2018) work, we aimed at investigating psychological correlates of
WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP disparity to better understand these variables. For the
purpose of understanding psychological correlates of WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP
disparity, we chose an individual differences approach and examined personality
predispositions, time spent on a social media platform, and disordered use of social media.
An examination of the psychological correlates, such as personality predispositions, of WTA,
WTP, and the WTA/WTP disparity is crucial because Sunstein (2018) in his work discusses
potential explanations for the effects he found. However, since no other variables aside from
WTA and WTP were assessed in this previous study, explanations remain hypothetical and
have not been tested for now.
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 5
To follow the above-mentioned aims, Chinese samples were recruited to investigate
WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP disparity in the context of prominent Chinese social media
platforms in between- and within-subjects studies. Results replicate the findings on a large
WTA/WTP disparity for social media platforms, which were due to large WTA scores and
low - oftentimes 0 Chinese RMB - WTP scores. Further, this disparity was negatively
associated with Openness across social media platforms. Implications of the present findings
for social media platforms and the acceptance of monetary payment models are deliberated.
Further, potential psychological mechanisms contributing to the high WTA scores and the
WTA/WTP disparity are introduced. For that purpose, a complex interplay between personal
predispositions, characteristics of the good under investigation (here: social media platforms),
and how and why the good is used by individuals is discussed. Finally, the results are
contemplated with regard to methodological implications for measuring valuation of social
media platforms in future studies.
1.1 Review of Previous Works and Theories Underlying the Present Work
1.1.1 WTA, WTP, the WTA/WTP Disparity, and the Endowment Effect
The WTA/WTP disparity is often examined in the valuation paradigm (Marzilli
Ericson & Fuster, 2014; Morewedge & Giblin, 2015). In this paradigm, individuals in one
group are asked about the minimum amount of money they need to be offered to sell a
specific good (WTA) they were endowed with before. Individuals in the other group are
asked about the maximum amount they are willing to pay to purchase the same good (WTP),
which they were not endowed with before. The ratio of mean/median WTA in one group
divided by mean/median WTP in the other group, or the difference between those scores is
investigated as the WTA/WTP disparity.
The WTA/WTP disparity is closely related to the endowment effect. The endowment
effect describes the general tendency to value a good (e.g., product or service) more when
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 6
one owns it. Often, the endowment effect is explained by dependence on a reference point
(status quo bias) and loss aversion, both included in prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky,
1979; Morewedge & Giblin, 2015; Tversky & Kahneman, 1991). The effect has been well-
known in economics, law, and psychology for roughly 40 years (Thaler, 1980).
The WTA/WTP disparity is an often-utilized measure of the endowment effect and
this effect is one potential explanation for the WTA/WTP disparity. As such, both the
WTA/WTP disparity and endowment effect have been investigated and demonstrated for
various physical and non-physical as well as private and public goods (Brown & Gregory,
1999; Horowitz & McConnell, 2002; Kahneman et al., 1990; Ortona & Scacciati, 1992;
Sunstein, 2018). The endowment effect, however, is not the only explanation for the
WTA/WTP disparity (among others, also profit motives might play a role; for further
explanations see: Brown, 2005; Brown & Gregory, 1999; Dommer & Swaminathan, 2013;
Morewedge et al., 2009; Morewedge & Giblin, 2015; Tunçel & Hammitt, 2014). In line with
this, there is no consensus on psychological mechanisms underlying and explaining the
WTA/WTP disparity. Putatively individual factors, such as personality traits, characteristics
of the good, and contextual factors are of importance.
1.1.2 WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP Disparity for Social Media Platforms
Digital goods, and more specifically the usage of social media platforms, are a special
kind of “goods” in the research field on WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP disparity. This
particularity is due to the above-mentioned reasons that one can, for example, only use but
(usually) not own social media services.
In this regard the work by Sunstein (2018) already mentioned above is of considerable
importance. In that study, the amount of money social media platform users were willing to
accept to discontinue using the platform (WTA) was much higher than the amount they were
willing to pay for platform use (WTP). With a ratio of roughly 20:1 across platforms, the
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 7
WTA/WTP disparity found for social media platforms was quite large and, hence, called a
“superendowment effect” in the previous work (Sunstein, 2018).
Based on these findings, the first aim of the present study was to test the robustness of
findings and expand results on the WTA/WTP disparity to other popular social media
platforms. Specifically, we were interested in investigating platforms widely used in more
Eastern countries like China, where platforms like Facebook are not available. Specifically,
we were interested in the platforms WeChat and QQ (Tencent Holding Ltd.) 1 (We Are
Social & Hootsuite, 2020). WeChat is a multipurpose social media application commonly
used in Asian countries such as China (We Are Social & Hootsuite, 2020). It combines
instant messaging services with classical social network functions. The latter include the
possibility to create one's own profile, a personal news feed, and possibilities to share one's
own experiences and to comment on posts of friends (Chan, 2015; Hou et al., 2018; Montag
et al., 2018). Additionally, WeChat offers "apps within an app" (Chan, 2015) adding
numerous functions from which one can choose to the WeChat app. Most prominently, one
can pay and send money to friends via the WeChat app, can use city services, and play games
(Montag et al., 2018). QQ is also an instant messaging service and one of the oldest social
media platforms in China (Hjorth et al., 2014). In terms of functionality, it is often compared
to the MSN messenger (Meng & Zuo, 2008). Next to messaging functions, it offers additional
add-ons such as games and the Q-Zone were one can share content with others (Pang, 2021).
Against the background and findings of the previous work (Sunstein, 2018), we
expected to find a WTA/WTP disparity for WeChat and QQ. We could not, however, draw
any conclusion about potential differences in disparities between the two platforms due to
lack of existing literature.
1 Of note, given methodological reasons outlined in the Supplementary Material, we will focus on the more
widely used WeChat and QQ platforms in China in the present work despite also having assessed data on
SinaWeibo and TikTok (see also preregistration of the present work).

1.1.3 Applying an Individual Differences Perspective to WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP
Disparity
The procedure to assess WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP disparity across two groups,
as implemented by Sunstein (2018) and many others, has some disadvantages. For example,
this procedure prevents the possibility of investigating individual WTA/WTP disparity scores
and associate them with individual differences variables, accordingly. Therefore, the
WTA/WTP disparity is often investigated as a general psychological phenomenon. However,
associations of WTA, WTP, and their disparity with individual differences variables are
highly interesting. This is because such associations help to understand which psychological
variables, such as personality traits, underly the WTA/WTP disparity. Indeed, some findings
point to individual differences in the size of WTA, WTP, and their disparity, accordingly
(Brown, 2005; Georgantzís & Navarro-Martínez, 2010; Kogut & Kogut, 2011). These
findings further support the idea of investigating the WTA/WTP disparity on an individual
level.
Therefore, we aimed to investigate WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP disparity for
WeChat and QQ not only in a between-subjects (groups) design. Additionally, we followed
the aim to explore individual scores in WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP disparity for these
social media platforms in a within-subjects design study to associate them with individual
differences variables.
1.1.4 Investigating Individual Differences in WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP Disparity in
Association with Individual Differences in other Variables
1.1.4.1 WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP Disparity and Usage of Social Media
Platforms. One can assume that individuals using a social media platform more frequently
and for a greater amount of time value the platform more. This assumption is underlined by a
study from Taiwan showing positive associations of measures of epistemic, hedonic, and
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 9
social value attributed to Facebook and Facebook "Stickiness", i.e., willingness to use
Facebook (more) frequently/often (Yang & Lin, 2014). Since both WTA and WTP are
measures of valuation of a good (Knetsch, 2020; Sunstein, 2018), time spent on a platform
can be expected to positively relate to both WTA and WTP for this platform. Specifically for
WTA, it can be assumed that individuals who use a platform frequently and time intensively
might have greater trouble discontinuing their usage and higher WTA, accordingly, compared
to individuals using the platform less. This assumption on WTA is supported by a study
showing positive associations between time spent on Facebook and the amount of money
individuals needed to be paid to discontinue using Facebook for a week (a version of a WTA
measure) (Mosquera et al., 2020). However, for WTP, in addition to a positive association
with time spent on a platform, also the possibility of a zero-correlation is possible. Following
an argument of Sunstein (2018), social media platforms might be "Wasting Time Goods"
(Sunstein, 2018, p. 5). As such, although some individuals might use certain social media
platforms a great deal, at the same time they may view them as valueless and useless. They
only use the platforms out of habit but assume that they might be better off without using
them (Sunstein, 2018). If people view social media as "Wasting Time Goods" their time
spent on social media platforms should not be associated with their WTP. Moreover,
currently users do not need to pay for using social media platforms (all which are under
investigation here). Hence, as a kind of rebellious act, it is also possible that many people
indicate that they are not willing to pay anything for a service currently freely available; at
least in terms of money. This assumption is underlined by findings of Sunstein (2018), who
reported that between 15%-46% of participants were not willing to pay any amount for using
different social media platforms. Although these numbers were not related to social media
use variables, they underline that variability in WTP scores might be limited, minimizing
potential associations of WTP scores with other variables such as time spent on a platform.
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 10
In summary, it can be assumed that WTA is positively associated with time spent on a
platform. For WTP, both is possible - a positive association with time spent on the platform
as well as a zero-correlation between the two variables. For the WTA/WTP disparity, this has
the following implications: the disparity is either not related to time spent on a platform
(when both WTA and WTP are related to time spent on the platform to the same degree) or
positively related to the time spent on a platform (when WTA but not WTP is related to time
spent on the platform). In our opinion, more theory and empirical findings support the second
assumption of a positive relation between the WTA/WTP disparity and time spent on the
platform.
In addition to time spent on a platform, we were interested in investigating
associations between WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP disparity for WeChat and QQ and
tendencies towards overall Social Networks Use Disorder (SNUD). SNUD is a specific type
of Internet Use Disorder describing excessive, i.e., pathological, use of social media
platforms; note ongoing discussions on the “correct” nomenclature of Internet Use Disorders
(Elhai et al., 2020; Montag, Wegmann, et al., 2021). Researchers describe SNUD based on a
strong urge to use social media, and using social media too much, resulting in negative
impacts on one’s life (Andreassen & Pallesen, 2014). Symptoms discussed in light of SNUD
are similar to substance-use disorder symptoms (Andreassen, 2015; Griffiths et al., 2014).
However, SNUD is not currently included in official diagnostic manuals (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013; World Health Organization, 2019).
Since SNUD is related to an urge to use social media platforms, it can be expected
that SNUD symptom severity is positively related to WTA, because individuals with high
SNUD scores should have difficulties discontinuing social media use. For WTP the same
argumentation as for time spent on the platform can be discussed. This argumentation leads
to assuming either a positive association or - what we deem more likely - no association
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 11
between SNUD and WTP. Thus, we expected the WTA/WTP disparity for WeChat and QQ
to be positively related to tendencies towards SNUD due to the same reasoning already
explained in light of time spent on social media platforms.
1.1.4.2 WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP Disparity and Personality. Associating
individual differences in personality traits with prominent scores derived from behavioral
economics – such as WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP disparity – can shed light on
underlying mechanisms. A widely accepted personality model is the Five-Factor model
constituting that personality can be described on the basis of five broad personality domains
(Fiske, 1949; a short summary can be found in: Montag & Elhai, 2019). Oftentimes these
domains are labeled Openness (to Experience), Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness, and Neuroticism and are known as the Big Five of Personality (Goldberg,
1990; Tupes & Christal, 1992).
Previous research indicates that time spent on social media is especially positively
related to Extraversion and Neuroticism, and negatively related to Conscientiousness
(Hughes et al., 2012; Montag et al., 2015; Ryan & Xenos, 2011). This might indicate an
indirect association of Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Neuroticism with WTA and the
WTA/WTP disparity for social media platforms. This is due to WTA putatively being closely
linked to time spent on the respective platform (see paragraph “WTA, WTP, and the
WTA/WTP Disparity and Usage of Social Media Platforms”). Moreover, in one study it was
found that WTA for a bottle of wine was negatively related to Extraversion and
Conscientiousness, while WTP was positively associated with Agreeableness; the disparity
was not investigated in light of associations with personality (Georgantzís & Navarro-
Martínez, 2010). Accordingly, one might conclude that Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and
Agreeableness are negatively related to the WTA/WTP disparity, at least for a bottle of wine.
Moreover, an experimental study manipulating emotions found that the WTA/WTP disparity
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 12
for a mug was only prevalent when happy (but not negative) emotions were induced (Lin et
al., 2006). This finding raises the question of whether general tendencies of (negative)
emotionality might also be associated with the WTA/WTP disparity on an individual level.
As part of the Big Five personality traits, higher Neuroticism is robustly associated with
higher negative emotionality (Rammstedt & Danner, 2017). Based on experimental findings
on effects of emotions on the WTA/WTP disparity, one might expect Neuroticism to be
negatively associated with the WTA/WTP disparity.
These previous studies reflect the possibility that personality might be associated with
individual differences in WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP disparity. However, none of the
studies investigated WTA and WTP for social media platforms in Chinese samples.
Moreover, some findings lead to contradicting hypotheses on the direction of effects
regarding personality associations with WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP disparity (see
previously mentioned findings on Extraversion and Neuroticism). Further, one must take into
account the large number of individuals not willing to pay for social media found in Sunstein
(2018), which potentially affects relations between WTP and personality traits (see reasoning
detailed above). Thus, it remains unclear whether and how (i.e., direction of effects)
personality predispositions are associated with WTA, WTP, and their disparity for (Chinese)
social media platforms. Therefore, we aimed to exploratively investigate associations of the
Big Five with WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP disparity for the Chinese social media
platforms WeChat and QQ.2
1.2 Summary of Aims of the Present Study
In summary, the present study had several aims: First, WTA, WTP, and the
WTA/WTP disparity for prominent Chinese social media platforms (WeChat and QQ) should
In the preregistration we expected Neuroticism (negatively) and Extraversion (positively) to be directly linked
to the WTA/WTP disparity as measure of the endowment effect. However, we dismissed these hypotheses after
evaluating the literature more in-depth.

be investigated in a between-groups design study to receive insights against the background
of the “classic” experimental approach across two groups (Study 1) and to replicate the study
design by Sunstein (2018). Secondly, WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP disparity in the
context of WeChat and QQ should be investigated in a within-subjects design study. Thereby,
we aimed to associate individual differences in these variables with individual differences in
personality, time spent on the respective platform, and SNUD to unravel the underlying
psychology of WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP disparity in the context of (Chinese/Eastern)
social media platforms.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Preregistration and Data Availability
The present studies including study design, sample size, inclusion/exclusion criteria
and analyses were preregistered at the Open Science Framework
the preregistration are described in this manuscript. Data and a data analysis script are
available at the Open Science Framework as well.
2.2 Study Design and Procedure
In total, the project consisted of three online surveys: two for Study 1 and one for
Anyone from age 18 who understood simplified Chinese characters could participate. Data
were collected at universities in China in 2019. More specifically, to ensure independence of
the samples, each sample was recruited at different universities in China. In all universities,
the same recruitment strategy was applied to counteract potential biases in the samples: in
addition to students recruited in general psychology courses, friends and family of students
could participate; hence, a snowballing recruitment strategy was applied to obtain a broader
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 14
sample than just psychology students. Participants received 8-12 (Chinese) RMB (about
$1.25-1.88 (USD); 2021.11.30) for completing one of the surveys. The local ethics
committee at one of the Universities approved the studies. All participants gave informed
electronic consent before participation.
2.2.1 Study 1: Between-Groups Study Design
In one online survey conducted in the realm of Study 1, participants were asked to fill
in several socio-demographic variables and to indicate which of the four social media
platforms – WeChat, SinaWeibo, QQ, TikTok – they used. For each platform used they were
further asked to indicate their WTA for each platform (see paragraph “Study 1 and 2: WTA
and WTP Items”). The second online survey was similar but participants were asked to
indicate their WTP for each platform they used.
2.2.2 Study 2: Within-Subjects Study Design
The online survey for Study 2 asked participants to i) complete socio-demographic
items, ii) indicate which social media platforms they used, iii) insert the WTA and afterwards
the WTP for each platform used (67 items of other questionnaires were presented in between
WTA and WTP items), iv) indicate time spent on each platform they used, and complete v)
the short Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS) and vi) the Big Five Inventory
(BFI).3
One might assume that assessing both WTA and WTP from each individual study
participant in a within-subjects design study leads to biases. One potential bias could be
based on the desire to answer consistently (Cialdini, 2006). Based on this, the values given by
a participant for WTA and WTP might be matched to be more consistent, despite individuals
3 Of note: the sample of this survey also completed questionnaires investigated in light of other research
questions on i) associations of acceptance versus fear of Artificial Intelligence with personality and ii)
associations of fear of COVID-19 with personality and social media and smartphone use disorder tendencies
during the pandemic (Montag, Sindermann, et al., 2021); the results regarding these research objectives are/will
be published in different papers given the differences in the topics under investigation.
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 15
actually wanting to answer differently. Moreover, when an individual is first asked to indicate
his/her WTP for a product, this might bias his/her later response on WTA, because he/she
previously took the perspective of a "buyer", or vice-versa. Hence, an anchoring effect might
be visible. However, several works report that there are no or only minor differences in
WTA/WTP disparities between studies using a between- versus within-subjects design
(investigating main effects) (Gaechter et al., 2007; Penn & Hu, 2021; Sayman & Öncüler,
2005; Tunçel & Hammitt, 2014); although it needs to be noted that these analyses did not
comprise studies on social media usage.

2.3.2 Final Samples of Study 2
For the sample investigating individual scores, we extracted n = 125 men and n = 125 women
to investigate WeChat (age: M = 21.27; SD = 5.45; n = 236 were undergraduate students).
Similarly, n = 128 men and n = 128 women were extracted to investigate WTA, WTP, and
the WTA/WTP disparity in the context of QQ (age: M = 21.65; SD = 6.10; n = 237 were
undergraduate students).
2.4 Measures
All measures were presented in simplified Chinese characters.
2.4.1 Study 1 and 2: WTA and WTP Items
In the WTA survey of Study 1, the following item was presented to individuals using
a certain platform: “Suppose that you are being offered money to stop using [platform]. How
much would you have to be paid per month, at a minimum, to make it worth your while to
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 18
stop using [platform]?” In the WTP survey of Study 1, the following item was presented to
individuals using a certain platform: “Suppose that you had to pay for the use of [platform].
How much would you be willing to pay, at most, per month?” The items on WTA and WTP
were based on the work by Sunstein (2018) and translated into Chinese by a forward- and
backward translation procedure and subsequent discussions in case of deviations between the
English original and back-translations.
In the within-subjects design study sample recruited for Study 2, both items on WTA
and WTP were assessed for each platform participants used.
Since individuals were asked for WTA and/or WTP for each platform they indicated
using, participants could be asked for WTA and WTP for more than one platform, which is
why the WeChat and QQ samples partly overlap.
2.4.2 Study 2: Big Five Inventory
We used the Chinese version of the BFI (John et al., 1991; Pervin & John, 2003) in
the sample recruited for Study 2. It consists of 44 items answered on a 5-point Likert-Scale
from 1 = “disagree strongly” to 5 = “agree strongly”. The present work will focus on the
scales assessing the broad Big Five domains. In the sample to investigate WeChat (n = 250),
Cronbach’s alphas lied between 0.65 (Agreeableness) and .75 (Openness with item 35; .79
without item 35; this item was negatively related to the total scale but kept for analysis in line
with the original scaling). In the sample for QQ (n = 256), Cronbach’s alphas lied
between .66 (Agreeableness) and .76 (Openness with item 35; .80 without item 35).
2.4.3 Study 2: Social Media Use Variable and Social Networks Use Disorder Scale
For each of the social media platforms under investigation a participant indicated
using, he/she was asked how many hours per day he/she spent on the platform; including the
possibility to insert decimal numbers to indicate, for example, half an hour.
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 19
Moreover, the short version of the BSMAS (Andreassen et al., 2012) was presented to
participants. It was translated into Chinese by a forward- and backward-translation procedure
and subsequent discussions in case of deviations between the English original and back-
translation. Scores can range between 1 = “very rarely” and 5 = “very often”. In the samples
to investigate WeChat (n = 250) and QQ (n = 256) Cronbach’s alphas were .87 and .86,
respectively.
2.5 Statistical Analysis
The statistical software R version 4.1.0 and RStudio version 1.4.1106 were used for
data analysis (R Core Team, 2018; RStudio Team, 2020). The following packages were used:
readxl (Wickham & Bryan, 2019), dplyr (Wickham et al., 2021), tidyr (Wickham, 2020),
careless (Yentes & Wilhelm, 2018), psych (Revelle, 2020), descr (Aquino & Includes R
source code and/or documentation written by Dirk Enzmann and Marc Schwartz and Nitin
Jain and Stefan Kraft, 2021), sampling (Tillé & Matei, 2016), lsr (Navarro, 2015), hmisc
(Harrell & with contributions from Charles Dupont and many others, 2020), correlation
(Makowski et al., 2020), and ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016). Of note, the analysis on the
WTA/WTP ratios will include analysis on mean (preregistered) and median values (not-
preregistered).
2.5.1 Study 1: Analysis across Separate Samples (Between-Groups Design)
Within each WTA and WTP sample, the mean/median WTA and WTP scores were
calculated. Afterwards, the WTA/WTP ratios were computed across groups (M(WTA ) /
WeChat
M(WTP ); M(WTA ) / M(WTP )).
WeChat QQ QQ
2.5.2 Study 2: Analysis in Samples providing Individual Scores (Within-Subjects Design)
All analyses described below were conducted separately in the samples using WeChat
(n = 250) and QQ (n = 256). Within the datasets comprising individual WTA and WTP
scores for WeChat and QQ, all variables, except age, WTA and WTP scores (except WTP for
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 20
WeChat), as well as WTA/WTP ratios, and time spent on WeChat/QQ showed skewness and
kurtosis of less than +/- 1 (Miles & Shevlin, 2001).
First, descriptive statistics of WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP ratios were examined.
Therefore, the mean/median WTA and WTP for WeChat and QQ were calculated at the
group level in the respective samples. Afterwards, the ratios of mean/median WTA divided
by mean/median WTP for the respective platform were calculated (M(WTA ) /
WeChat
M(WTP ); M(WTA ) / M(WTP )).
WeChat QQ QQ
Next, individual WTA/WTP ratios for each participant were calculated and
descriptive statistics of these individual scores are presented, as well. Similarly, descriptive
statistics for BFI scores, time spent on WeChat or QQ, and the short BSMAS were calculated
and are presented. Associations of all variables of interest with age and gender can be found
in the Supplementary Material (presented in line with the preregistration and for interested
readers).
Next, zero-order bivariate correlations between all study variables were computed. Of
note, the structural equation models which were preregistered were not computed and are not
presented due to the low (near zero correlations) between the variables.

exchanged these scores with a value of 1 (this was the next higher number indicated by other
participants; this transformation was not preregistered but otherwise we could not have calculated
individual ratios). Median scores of the WTA/WTP ratios were: WeChat (total): 50.00, QQ (total):
50.00. The time spent on the platform is presented in hours per day, hence, value of, for example, 1.50
indicated 90 minutes and a value of 2.42 indicates roughly 146 minutes.

4. Discussion
Our first aim related to the present studies was to investigate WTA, WTP, and the
WTA/WTP disparities for prominent Chinese/Eastern social media platforms. More
specifically, we were interested in whether we would find results similar to those observed by
Sunstein (2018), namely (large) WTA/WTP disparities for Chinese social media platforms. In
a between-groups design study (Study 1) and a within-subjects design study (Study 2), we
found evidence for high WTA and lower WTP scores for both WeChat and QQ, hence,
WTA/WTP disparities. These results not only replicate those found for Western social media
platforms (Sunstein, 2018), but also show that a WTA/WTP disparity for social media
platforms can be observed on group and individual levels.
On the one hand, the disparities found in the present samples were due to high WTA
scores - between 648 RMB ($101.35, 2021.11.29, within-subjects study) and 7,821 RMB
($1.223.20, 2021.11.29; between-subjects study). These amounts were larger than previously
observed for Western platforms (Sunstein, 2018) leading to larger WTA/WTP disparities in
the present study compared to the previous work. One reason for the larger WTA scores
might be that both WeChat and QQ have manifold functionalities aside from social functions
(chatting, sending pictures, implementing phone calls, etc.), such as sending money to
friends, paying, and using city services (see, for example, for WeChat: Chan, 2015; Montag
et al., 2018). Thus, both services might be much more incorporated into everyday life of
Chinese citizens compared to social media platforms in the lives of Western individuals.
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 27
Thus, giving up using WeChat and also QQ might be much more difficult than giving up a
Western social media platform because many different services offered by WeChat/QQ
would need to be substituted. In line with this, the higher number of functions offered by
WeChat/QQ might result in higher WTA scores in the present study compared to what was
observed in the work by Sunstein (2018) and higher WTA/WTP disparities, accordingly.
Methodological issues might contribute to the high WTA scores (and high WTA/WTP
disparities) as well and are discussed in the limitations section.
On the other hand, the disparities found in the present study were due to low WTP
scores and many individuals not willing to pay anything for using a social media platform. In
fact, in the between-subjects design study, 23.47% (WeChat) and 22.53% (QQ) of
individuals, and 13.20% (WeChat) and 14.06% (QQ) of individuals in the within-subjects
study were not willing to pay anything. These numbers are fairly in line with the findings of
Sunstein (2018). The implications of these findings are two-fold. Firstly, because we were
able to replicate the findings on WTP scores, we agree with the explanations of Sunstein
(2018). More specifically, he mentions that the great number of individuals not willing to pay
might be due to a rebellious act. Individuals might indicate 0 RMB because they are outraged
about being asked to pay a monetary fee for a service currently offered "for free" in terms of
money. It remains unknown, however, in how far individuals were willing to pay if they
really needed to pay for a social media platform. This also draws attention to potential issues
related to the hypothetical scenario created in the present work (as discussed later in the
discussion). In summary, we agree with Sunstein (2018) in that WTP scores in the context of
social media might not be the most valid scores to assess valuation of social media. WTA,
therefore, might be a more valid measure of valuation in the context of social media use. This
assumption is supported by the application of WTA measures in the context of social media
in other studies (Brynjolfsson et al., 2019; Corrigan et al., 2018).
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 28
Aside from putatively being a biased measure of valuation, the scores in WTP still
give important insights. In addition to the number of individuals not willing to pay (see
above), these results reveal generally low WTP scores. The findings on low WTP scores are
not only in line with the findings by Sunstein (2018) but also with a previous study on
German individuals, which investigated whether and how much individuals were willing to
pay for usage of a social media platform per month. This previous study reported that most
individuals were not willing to pay anything or at most 1€ per month (1 € = $1.13;
2021.11.29) (Sindermann, Kuss, et al., 2020). These findings are of major importance for
current debates on whether using social media platforms should be paid for with money,
instead of with the allowance that one’s personal data are being used (Sindermann, Kuss, et
al., 2020). This discussion is based on the negative impacts that the current data business
model can have, such as prolonging time users spend on social media platforms putatively
leading to use disorders in vulnerable individuals (Montag et al., 2019; Sindermann, Elhai, &
Montag, 2020), invasions into privacy (see discussion on “surveillance capitalism” (Zuboff,
2019)), and information filtering putatively associated with negative effects on democracy
(Bozdag & van den Hoven, 2015; Pariser, 2011; Sindermann, Elhai, Moshagen, et al., 2020;
Sunstein, 2004, 2007). In summary, it seems like across different countries and social media
platforms, many individuals are not willing to pay anything or at least only a very small
amount of money for social media usage. This conclusion points towards difficulties in
implementing monetary payment models in the future to reduce negative side effects of the
data business model. More detailed studies investigating under which circumstances
individuals are willing to pay for social media use are necessary. For example, certain
improvements in design, friend suggestions and information presentation (e.g., combatting
Fake News) mechanisms on social media platforms might increase users' valuation and their
WTP for a social media platform. However, it must also be noted i) that discussions on the
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 29
current business model are mostly implemented in Western societies where huge,
supranational, private companies own the platforms ii) and that we did not ask our study
participants to choose between paying with money versus paying with their data. Thus,
whether participants prefer one payment option over the other remains unknown based on the
present data.
Next, the present study followed the aim to investigate WTA, WTP, and the
WTA/WTP disparity by means of an individual differences approach. Against our
expectations, the WTA/WTP disparity scores for both WeChat and QQ were barely
significantly associated with any of the other variables: the WTA/WTP disparity for WeChat
was only significantly negatively associated with Openness; an association we did not expect
beforehand. The WTA/WTP disparity for QQ was significantly associated with Openness
(negatively), Conscientiousness (negatively), and time spent on QQ (positively); only the
latter association has been hypothesized. To investigate these findings more in depth,
2). These results indicate that the associations of Openness with the WTA/WTP disparity
scores are mostly driven by the negative associations of Openness with WTA for both
WeChat and QQ. Moreover, time spent on QQ was positively related to both WTA and WTP
for QQ, while time spent on WeChat was only significantly positively related to WTP for
WeChat. The findings on associations between time spent on a platform and WTP might
contradict the general assumption that social media platforms are seen as "Wasting time
Goods" (Sunstein, 2018).
The findings of negative associations between Openness and WTA and the
WTA/WTP disparity for both WeChat and QQ seem especially interesting due to the
replication across platforms. Individuals with high scores in Openness are described as being
interested in manifold topics and as being open to new experiences, such as food, countries,
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 30
and ideas (Rammstedt & Danner, 2017). A study by Kircaburun et al. (2018) shows that
Openness is most strongly related to informational and educational use of social media.
These activities/functions can easily be substituted by other online platforms such as news
websites, etc. The wide availability of substitutes might explain the lower WTA in
individuals scoring high in Openness and the lower WTA/WTP disparity, accordingly. This
is in line with findings showing that availability of substitutes decreases the WTA/WTP
disparity (Tunçel & Hammitt, 2014). Although we do not want to overinterpret the present
findings with regard to Openness (see small effect sizes (Cohen, 1988) and scatterplots in the
Supplementary Material), the previously mentioned consideration on the importance of how
and why individuals use a good/service is crucial for further studies investigating individual
differences in WTA, WTP, and the WTA/WTP disparity (in the context of social media). As
can be concluded from the present study, an interaction of individual characteristics and
characteristics of the good/service under investigation and how and why it is used might
ultimately explain differences in all scores (WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP disparity). These
putative interactions have important implications for future studies and theory building. In
light of social media platforms, for example, an examination of the different functions offered
by WeChat and QQ (or in the Western context Facebook, etc.) and who tends to use which
functions (i.e., usage motives based on the uses and gratification theory) might help to build
an empirical model to explain individual WTA, WTP, and WTA/WTP disparity scores in the
context of different social media platforms.
Some limitations of the studies must be mentioned. First of all, results are limited to
the Chinese context and focus on Chinese students (not representative of the general Chinese
population) and Chinese social media platforms. Although some results are in line with
results of similar other studies from Western samples and on Western social media platforms
(Sindermann, Kuss, et al., 2020; Sunstein, 2018), it is unclear whether these exact results can
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 31
be replicated in other studies and are generalizable to other samples. This is especially true
for results which have not been investigated previously as well as for the size of WTA, WTP,
and the WTA/WTP disparities which differ across studies.
Moreover, there are some methodological limitations to the present studies. For
example, we only asked users of specific platforms (WeChat and QQ) for their WTA and/or
WTP, however, not non-users. This has the advantages that the role in the valuation paradigm
is not confounded with actually owning or not-owning the good. Moreover, everybody asked
about WTA and WTP knows about the functions offered by the platforms and estimate its
value, which might not be true for non-users. Additionally, we chose this procedure based on
the work by Sunstein (2018). Nevertheless, it does not completely reflect the situation
(owners versus non-owners) mostly investigated in light of the WTA/WTP disparity. Next, it
might be possible that in the within-subjects design study (Study 2) the order of the WTA and
WTP items (first WTA, afterwards WTP) had an effect on responses, hence, the WTA/WTP
disparity. However, it must be noted that many unrelated items were presented in between the
WTA and WTP items in the within-subjects design study (see “Methods” section).
Additionally, the WTA/WTP disparity in the between-groups design study were higher than
in the within-subjects design study contradicting previous findings (Sayman & Öncüler,
2005; Tunçel & Hammitt, 2014). This finding was due to lower WTA and higher WTP scores
in the within-subjects design study. The higher WTP scores in the within-subjects design
study design might be due to an anchoring effect based on first completing the WTA items.
However, this is a potential explanation, which we cannot test with the present data.
Moreover, why WTA (which was presented first in the within-subjects design study) was
lower in the within-subjects sample compared to the between-subjects study samples,
remains unknown. Because the samples of the between- and within-subject design studies
were quite similar (see recruitment strategy, mean age, gender distribution, educational
WTA, WTP, WTA/WTP DISPARITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA 32
background), we do not believe that the discrepancies in the WTA/WTP disparities between
samples are due to differences in the socio-demographic backgrounds of the samples.
Nevertheless, because we recruited samples at different universities, there might still be some
differences, which we did not acknowledge; we deem this as highly unlikely, though.
Moreover, the present studies asked for WTA and WTP in a hypothetical scenario. It
is possible that results differ when individuals are actually confronted with the decision to
stop using WeChat or QQ (WTA) and – more likely – with the decision on whether to pay to
be able to continue using WeChat and QQ (WTP); although mixed findings on differences in
WTA/WTP disparities between hypothetical and real scenarios on other goods than social
media are reported in previous works (Horowitz & McConnell, 2002; Tunçel & Hammitt,
2014). Next, another methodological limitation is the fact that we did not set a highest
amount of money from which participants could possibly choose; but see exclusion of
outliers as described in the Supplementary Material. It is possible – especially against the
background of the hypothetical scenario – that based on this lack of a monetary ceiling, some
individuals inserted very high amounts of money for WTA to maximize their payoff. The
lack of a monetary ceiling might also contribute to a further shortcoming of the present study,
namely, the large differences between mean and median WTA scores and WTA/WTP-ratios,
accordingly. Finally, it is important to note that we did not specify what exactly “stop using a
social media service” meant: it could have been interpreted as simply “pausing” the use, i.e.,
being able to return to the platform anytime and still having one’s social graph, stored photos,
information etc. It could have, however, alternatively been interpreted as completely deleting
one’s information from the platform; thus, having to reconnect with old friends when
returning and losing all stored information, such as photographs, posts, etc. Disentangling
these two aspects is an important research aim for forthcoming studies. Relatedly, also

5. Conclusions
In summary, the present work supports the existence of comparatively high WTA
scores versus WTP scores, thus, a WTA/WTP disparity for social media platforms in the
Chinese cultural context. Moreover, the generally low WTP scores indicate difficulties in
introducing monetary payment models to the social media context due to low acceptance of
such models by users. Additionally, we found that individual differences in the WTA/WTP
disparity scores were significantly related to Openness via its negative association with
WTA. Other individual differences variables were barely associated with WTA, WTP, or
their disparity. Future studies should investigate WTA, WTP, and their disparity in the
context of social media platforms more in-depth to help reveal underlying mechanisms and
specific functionalities of social media platforms underlying WTA, WTP, and their disparity.
