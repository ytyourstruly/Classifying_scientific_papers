Abstract
Most work on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has focused on its attitudinal and demographic correlates of
individuals, but the characteristics of vaccines themselves also appear to be important. People are more
willing to take vaccines with higher reported levels of efficacy and safety. Has this dynamic sparked
comparative hesitancy towards specific COVID-19 vaccines? We conduct a series of cross-sectional
survey experiments to test for brand-based differences in perceived effectiveness, perceived safety,
and vaccination intention. Examining more than 6,200 individuals in a series of cross-sectional
surveys, we find considerably more reluctance to take the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson
vaccines compared to those from Pfizer and Moderna if offered, despite all vaccines being approved
and deemed safe and effective by a federal regulator. Comparative hesitancy towards these vaccines
grew over the course of our fielding as controversy arose over their link to extremely rare, but
serious side effects. Comparative vaccine-specific hesitancy is strongest among people who are
usually most open to mass vaccination efforts. Its effects are substantial: most respondents reported
a willingness to wait months for their preferred vaccine rather than receive either the AstraZeneca or
Johnson & Johnson vaccine immediately. Our findings call for additional research on the
determinants and consequences of COVID-19 vaccine-specific hesitancy and communication
strategies to minimize this challenge.

1. Introduction
A globally-scaled mass vaccination campaign is integral to containing the COVID-19
pandemic. As new variants emerge and as protection from initial vaccines wane, it will also be
necessary to distribute follow-up “booster” shots. Encouraging continued uptake of COVID-19
vaccines by members of the public is a vital and urgent public health issue.
A growing body of research has been dedicated to understanding the sources and dynamics of
COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and how it complicates efforts at mass vaccination. Most of this
research, however, aims to understand hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines in general. It is also
likely, however, that people have preferences over currently available vaccine options and exhibit
considerable hesitancy towards specific vaccines that are influenced by objective features of
competing vaccines or communications surrounding them. Depending on the availability of various
vaccines in different national contexts, this could be deeply problematic for mass vaccination efforts
in its own right.
This paper uses Canada as a case study of these dynamics. As of January 2022, the national
regulator, Health Canada, has approved four COVID-19 vaccines for distribution: Pfizer, Moderna,
AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson, each with different recommended usage guidelines, levels of
availability, and safety and efficacy profiles. We ask three principal research questions: 1) to what
degree do people exhibit hesitancy towards specific vaccines? 2) How does this hesitancy vary over
time in response to the communication environment? And 3) which groups of citizens are more
likely to exhibit this hesitancy?
We answer these questions with a study included in repeated cross-sectional surveys of adult
Canadian citizens, fielded between February and May 2021 as Canada’s mass vaccination campaign
began a large-scale roll-out. Importantly, the initially limited supply of available vaccines meant that
individuals were sometimes unable to choose a particular brand, though brand choice eventually
became possible, depending on an individual’s province of residence and other individual-level
factors. The study features an experiment asking respondents to rate the effectiveness and safety of a
randomly assigned vaccine, and indicate their willingness to take the vaccine if offered, conducted
over three waves as controversy emerged over the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines.
We rely on comparisons between individuals to infer vaccine-specific hesitancy.
We find substantial vaccine-specific hesitancy in the Canadian context. Respondents reported
comparatively more hesitancy towards the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, and this
hesitancy grew over the course of fielding as controversy related to these vaccines arose. Second, we
show that people’s beliefs about the safety of vaccines became an increasingly important influence
on people’s willingness to take them if offered, especially among respondents who were randomly
assigned AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson. We also show that comparative aversion to the
AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines is stronger for those who are typically most
supportive of vaccines and is intense: a sizable segment of the population is willing to wait months
to receive their preferred vaccine over those from AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson.
2. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy
Ensuring continued widespread uptake of vaccines is vitally important to controlling the
COVID-19 pandemic. However, we know from history that vaccination efforts are often met with
resistance in some quarters of society, despite being one of the most important public health
advances in history (Wolfe & Sharpe, 2002). A large body of scholarly work has sought to identify
the factors that make people more vaccine hesitant – a reluctance or refusal of an individual to receive
a vaccine for themselves or their children – or prone to endorse vaccine misinformation and anti-
vaccine policy attitudes.
Several important lessons have emerged from this line of research. Ideological conservatives
appear to be more vaccine hesitant in the United States than liberals (Baumgaertner, Carlisle &
Justwan, 2018), which may not have been true in the past. Republican supporters are also less likely
to hold accurate beliefs about vaccines, with possible downstream consequences on vaccine policy
preferences (Joslyn & Sylvester, 2019; Motta, 2021b). Support for specific vaccines can also decrease
in response to politicization of a given vaccine in the news media (Fowler & Gollust, 2015). Lower
knowledge levels are also associated with greater confidence that one knows more than vaccine
experts, which is in turn associated with anti-vaccine policy attitudes – a Dunning-Kruger effect
(Motta, Callaghan & Sylvester, 2018). Distrust in scientific authorities is also heavily connected to
vaccine misinformation endorsement, as is social media use (Stecula, Kuru & Jamieson, 2020),
consistent with a wide range of work documenting vaccine misinformation online (Elkin, Pullon &
Stubbe, 2020; Jamison et al., 2020; Keelan et al., 2007; Shah et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2021).
A growing body of work examining the correlates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy has arrived
at very similar conclusions. Hesitancy is found among ideological conservatives, at least in the
American context, as well as those with low trust in experts. It is also higher among racialized
minorities and women, those with more hesitancy towards childhood vaccines, and those who are
skeptical of the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic (Callaghan et al., 2021; Motta, 2020). These
findings also line up with research examining the correlates of compliance with other public health
guidelines like mask wearing and social distancing (Allcott et al., 2020; Gadarian, Goodman &
Pepinsky, 2021; Merkley & Loewen, 2021; Pennycook et al., 2021).
The case of COVID-19 vaccines, however, is unique in one other way: there are multiple
vaccines on offer each with different characteristics and safety and efficacy profiles. The availability
of these vaccines will vary over time and across national contexts. The above work examines
attitudinal and demographic correlates of hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines as an aggregate
category, but the characteristics of vaccines may also matter for hesitancy towards specific vaccines.
There are good reasons to expect people may have hesitancy towards specific COVID-19
vaccines. Trial data for COVID-19 vaccines by AstraZeneca and Johnston & Johnston indicated
they were less effective at preventing symptomatic infection than those by Pfizer and Moderna,
though they were reported to all be similarly effective at preventing severe disease and death
(Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, 2021; Teo, 2021). More recently, public health
agencies in some countries raised alarms about a link between the AstraZeneca and Johnson &
Johnson vaccines and rare, but severe adverse events, which was widely reported in the news media.
These dynamics may have induced vaccine-specific hesitancy. In short, people may have formed
preferences over the range of available COVID-19 vaccines and developed comparative hesitancy
towards some of them based on discourse surrounding the safety and efficacy characteristics of
these vaccines.
There has been some work exploring how the characteristics of hypothetical COVID-19
vaccines affect hesitancy. People are less willing to take foreign-manufactured vaccines, as well as
those with weaker safety and efficacy profiles (Kaplan & Milstein, 2021; Kreps et al., 2020; Motta,
2021a). But these studies were done before it was clear which COVID-19 vaccines were going to be
on offer. Merkley & Loewen (2021) focus on identifying communication strategies to improve
willingness to take the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, but do not identify how
hesitancy towards these vaccines compares to those from Pfizer or Moderna, how that has changed
over time, and who exactly is most likely to differentiate by brand. This is our focus in this paper.
3. Materials and Methods
Our research was approved by the University of Toronto Social Sciences, Humanities and
Education Research Ethics Board (protocol no. 38251). All respondents included in the following
analyses provided their informed consent. Our research was fielded in three cross-sectional waves –
February 23-March 1, 2021 (N=2,495), March 17-23, 2021 (N=2,511) and April 15-20, 2021
(N=1,455) – conducted on non-probability samples of adult Canadian citizens from the online panel
provider Dynata. Quotas in each wave were set on age (i.e., 18/34, 35/54, and 55+), gender (i.e.,
male, female), region (i.e., Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, and West), and language (i.e., English, French)
Materials provides a breakdown in the demographics of each of the three surveys along with the
population benchmark.2
We conducted a four condition between-subjects experiment. Respondents were randomly
assigned into four groups: Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson.3 They received
the following three questions where the brand of the vaccine was piped into the text based on their
assigned condition: 1) If you were offered the [insert brand] coronavirus vaccine, how likely would
you be to take it? (very likely, somewhat likely, not very likely, not at all likely); 2) How would you
rate the effectiveness of the [insert brand] coronavirus vaccine? (very effective, somewhat effective,
not very effective, not at all effective); and 3) How would you rate the safety of the [insert brand]
coronavirus vaccine? (very safe, somewhat safe, not very safe, not at all safe). All of our outcomes
are rescaled from 0-1 where 1 indicates the most positive vaccine evaluations.
2 The mass vaccination campaign in Canada began to roll out after our second wave. Consequently, we began tracking
the number of people who reported their first COVID-19 vaccine dose as of wave 3. In one departure from pre-
registration, we remove 213 respondents from our third wave who self-reported having been vaccinated. The results
from the following analyses, however, remain virtually identical when including these respondents.
3 In the first wave Johnson & Johnson was excluded because it was not yet approved by Health Canada.
We pre-registered expectations that intention (H1), perceived effectiveness (H2), and
perceived safety (H3) should be lower for respondents in the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson
treatment conditions compared to those in the Moderna and Pfizer conditions.4 Information on the
comparatively lower efficacy of the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines likely weakened
confidence in their effectiveness, while media coverage of a link between these vaccines and serious
side effects reduced perceptions of their safety. These changing perceptions, in turn, reduced
willingness to receive these vaccines if offered.5
We test our hypotheses with an independent samples t-test (1=AstraZeneca/Johnson &
Johnson, 0=Pfizer/Moderna). We also present the model predictions for the following equation
with survey wave fixed effects (X) estimated using Ordinary Least Squares regression to illustrate the
differences across our three outcomes for each vaccine:
𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑎 + 𝛽 𝑎𝑧𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑧𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑎 + 𝛽 𝑗&𝑗 + 𝑋 + 𝜀 (1)
1 2 3
All significance tests are two-tailed. We use a p-value threshold of 0.05 to determine statistical
significance with HC2-robust standard errors. All analyses are conducted using STATA version 16.
Events transpired during our fielding that likely influenced vaccine intention and perceptions
of their safety and efficacy above and beyond baseline expectations derived from initial safety and
efficacy trials. Wave 1 (February 23-March 1) was conducted before safety concerns arose with the
AstraZeneca vaccine. Health Canada approved AstraZeneca for adults 18 and older on February 26
in the middle of fielding. Wave 2 (March 17-23) was conducted after considerable controversy arose
with the AstraZeneca vaccine – specifically its link to rare, but serious blood clotting episodes.
Denmark suspended administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine on March 11 and Germany and
France followed suit on March 14. All told, a dozen European countries suspended AstraZeneca
vaccine administration in between waves 1 and 2, while Health Canada maintained their safety and
effectiveness. Most of the skepticism towards the AstraZeneca vaccine expressed by public health
authorities, to this point, was from public health agencies in other countries.
During the interval between waves 2 (March 17-23) and 3 (April 15-20), growing skepticism of
the AstraZeneca vaccine was expressed by domestic health authorities. On March 29 the National
Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommended suspending AstraZeneca
administration for those under the age of 55 due to blood clotting concerns, and the provinces
study prior to registration.
5 We cannot directly shed light on the causal mechanism linking COVID-19 vaccine brand to intention with these design
(see Bullock et al. (2010) for challenges of causal inference with mediation analysis). That being said, we include a path
analysis in the Supplementary Materials that descriptively shows the direct and indirect effects of our COVID-19 vaccine
brand treatment on intention to vaccinate. These analysis show that 75% of the effect of the brand treatment on
intention runs indirectly through changes in perceived effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. More details on this
analysis and its limitations can be found in the Supplementary Materials.
followed this recommendation immediately.6 Health Canada, however, continued to maintain that
the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks – an announcement they made on April 14. In
addition, on April 13 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration also recommended a pause in the
administration of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine due to similar safety concerns. Our period of
fielding allow us to observe potential dynamics in vaccine-specific hesitancy over this period.
We estimate a series of models where we regress our outcome variables on the brand
conditions, the survey waves, and interactions between the brand conditions and survey waves as
follows:
𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑎 + 𝛽 𝑎𝑧𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑧𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑎 + 𝛽 𝑗&𝑗 + 𝛽 𝑤𝑎𝑣𝑒2 + 𝛽 𝑤𝑎𝑣𝑒3 +

𝛽 𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑧𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑎 ∗ 𝑤𝑎𝑣𝑒3 + 𝛽 𝑗&𝑗 ∗ 𝑤𝑎𝑣𝑒3 + 𝜀 (2)

We display the marginal effects of each brand (reference = Pfizer) across each wave of our study to
illustrate dynamics over the course of our fielding.
We expect reductions in all three of our outcomes for the AstraZeneca and Johnson &
Johnson vaccines as a result of communication surrounding these vaccines. But, this attention was
primarily focused on rare side effects related to the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines,
rather than efficacy concerns. In so doing, the communication environment may have primed safety
perceptions. We may observe a growing association between safety perceptions and intention over
the course of fielding. We estimate the following equation:
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠 + 𝛽 𝑠𝑎𝑓𝑒𝑡𝑦 + 𝛽 𝑤𝑎𝑣𝑒2 + 𝛽 𝑤𝑎𝑣𝑒3 +

𝑤𝑎𝑣𝑒3 + 𝜀 (3)
Increased communication around vaccine safety may have primed safety considerations across
the board, or it may have increased the importance of these considerations only for the vaccines at
the centre of the emerging controversy. So, we estimate the following equation which allows us to
evaluate this priming effect across treatment conditions (i.e., Pfizer/Moderna vs.
AstraZeneca/Johnson & Johnson):
6 Importantly, NACI operates as an advisory board and not a regulator. It existed before the COVID-19 pandemic, and
previously focussed principally on childhood vaccinations.

Finally, we conduct exploratory analyses to evaluate which groups of citizens exhibit the
greatest hesitancy towards the AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson vaccines. We focus on age,
vaccination intention, anti-intellectualism or trust in experts, support for childhood vaccination,
COVID-19 threat perceptions, and COVID-19 news exposure. We cannot make causal claims as to
which specific trait moderates our treatment, but we can gain a general sense of the profile of
individuals who are more likely to differentiate between vaccine brands.
We do not have clear theoretical expectations on the direction of the effects. On the one
hand, it is possible we may observe stronger effects among groups that are typically more supportive
of vaccines. These individuals could be more responsive to communication from public health
authorities and experts about the comparative efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, while
vaccine skeptics would be generally unresponsive to communications disseminated by sources they
do not trust.
On the other hand, we could observe something akin to a motivated reasoning process, where
vaccine skeptics are persuaded by information about the comparatively higher risk and lower
efficacy of the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines because of its usefulness in bolstering
their prior beliefs about the risks of vaccination, while vaccine supporters resist this information
because of its perceived threat to their beliefs that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective.
We fit a series of linear models including an interaction between these
demographic/attitudinal covariates and a binary indicator of AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson
treatment (1=AstraZeneca/Johnson & Johnson, 0=Pfizer/Moderna) using OLS:
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝛼 + 𝛽 𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑧𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑎/𝑗&𝑗 + 𝛽 𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑒 + 𝛽 𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑧𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑎/𝑗&𝑗 ∗

4. Results
Our pre-registered expectations were met when pooling across our three survey waves.
Intention is 0.14 points lower on a 0-1 scale in the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson conditions
compared to Pfizer and Moderna, consistent with H1 (95% CI = -0.16, -0.12; p < 0.001). Perceived
effectiveness is 0.11 points lower on a 0-1 scale in the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson
conditions compared to Pfizer and Moderna, consistent with H2 (95% CI = -0.12, -0.09; p < 0.001).
Perceived safety is also 0.11 points lower on a 0-1 scale in the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson
conditions compared to Pfizer and Moderna, consistent with H3 (95% CI = -0.12, -0.09; p < 0.001).
Our pre-registered expectations were met. There are other, less sizable effects. Hesitancy towards
the AstraZeneca vaccine appears to exceed that of Johnson & Johnson and skepticism of Moderna
appears to be slightly higher than Pfizer. These differences are significant at the p<0.001 level and

There are also important differences in people’s comparative hesitancy towards available
COVID-19 vaccine brands over the time of our fielding. The estimated marginal effects are shown
between the Pfizer and AstraZeneca conditions (95% CI = -0.13, -0.07; p < 0.001). This effect more

by wave 3 (95% CI = -0.38, -0.28; p < 0.001). We see a similar pattern with Johnson & Johnson
after the FDA recommended a pause in its administration. Intention was initially 0.09 points lower
in the Johnson & Johnson condition compared to Pfizer in wave 2 (95% CI = -0.12, -0.05; p <
0.001). This grew to 0.26 points lower by wave 3 after the FDA announcement (95% CI = -0.31, -
0.21; p < 0.001).

We also see evidence of priming effects: safety perceptions became a more important
marginal effects of perceived effectiveness (left) and safety (right) on intention across our three
waves (from equation 3). The marginal effect of perceived effectiveness on intention (both on 0-1
scales) dropped from 0.43 in wave 1 (95% CI = 0.36, 0.49, p < 0.001) to 0.30 in wave 3 (95% CI =
0.20, 0.38, p < 0.001). This difference is statistically significant (p = 0.019). At the same time, the
marginal effect of perceived safety increased from 0.57 in wave 1 (95% CI = 0.51, 0.63, p < 0.001)
to 0.69 in wave 3 (95% CI = 0.61, 0.78, p < 0.001). This difference is also statistically significant (p
= 0.017).
It does not appear, however, that this is true irrespective of the vaccine in question. The

older respondents. Intention is estimated to be 0.08 points lower in the AstraZeneca and Johnson &

0.001; top-left panel). This difference grows to 0.20 points for those aged 72 (95% CI = -0.23, -0.17;

Second, we stronger effects among people with predispositions sympathetic to vaccinations.
Among those who are most trusting of experts, we would expect a 0.19 point difference in intention
between the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson conditions compared to Pfizer and Moderna
(95% CI = -0.22, -0.16; p < 0.001; top-right panel). In contrast, we expect a small and not
statistically significant 0.02 point difference for those with the highest levels of anti-intellectual
sentiment (95% CI = -0.08, 0.05; p = 0.595; top-right panel). For those who are most hostile to
childhood vaccinations, we expect only a small and not statistically significant difference in intention
between the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson conditions compared to Pfizer and Moderna (-
0.01; 95% CI = -0.07, 0.05; p = 0.798; centre-left panel). Among those who are most supportive of
childhood vaccination, the expected difference grows to 0.17 points (95% CI = -0.19, -0.15; p <
0.001; centre-left panel).
Third, we see stronger effects among people who perceive the most risk from COVID-19 and
among those who are most attentive to COVID-19 news. The difference in intention between the
AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson conditions compared to Pfizer and Moderna is 0.18 points for
those who perceive the threat from COVID-19 to be most serious (95% CI = -0.21, -0.16; p <
0.001; centre-right panel). This difference weakens to 0.05 points among those who perceive the
least amount of threat, which is not quite statistically significant (95% CI = -0.05, 0.00; p = 0.051;
centre-right panel). Similarly, the difference in intention between the AstraZeneca and Johnson &
Johnson conditions compared to Pfizer and Moderna is larger among those who pay attention to
COVID-19 news several times a day (-0.18; 95% CI = -0.21, -0.15; p < 0.001; bottom-left panel)
than those who do not pay attention at all (-0.05; 95% CI = -0.10, -0.01; p = 0.030; bottom-left
panel).
Finally, the difference in intention between the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson
conditions compared to Pfizer and Moderna is more than three times as strong among those who
reported they would take a COVID-19 vaccine when offered at an earlier stage of the survey (-0.17;
95% CI = -0.19, -0.16; p < 0.001; bottom-right panel) than those who said no or expressed
uncertainty on this question (-0.05; 95% CI = -0.08, -0.03; p < 0.001; bottom-right panel).
Comparative hesitancy towards AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson is strongest among those who
are most amenable to vaccination.
5. Discussion
Mass COVID-19 vaccination campaigns have to wrestle with the challenges posed by vaccine
hesitancy. One dimension of this challenge is quite unlike that for other more established vaccines:
there are multiple vaccines with different safety and efficacy profiles with levels of availability and
accessibility that vary over time and across national contexts. People may habour strong preferences
for, or aversion to, specific vaccines. This can pose a problem for public health agencies relying on
less-preferred vaccines.
Our analysis provide three central contributions. First, we show that there is a significant level
of aversion to COVID-19 vaccines from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson in the Canadian
context, consistent with our pre-registered expectations. Descriptively, it appears that our brand
treatments mostly influenced willingness to take the randomly assigned vaccine indirectly through
safety and efficacy perceptions (see Supplementary Materials).
Second, we illustrate important dynamics in this process by leveraging the time period of our
analysis. Hesitancy towards the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines intensified greatly as
public health agencies in Canada and the U.S. issued warnings and restrictions on their usage and
news media covered these developments. These communications also appear to have shifted the
fundamental drivers of people’s willingness to take certain vaccines. Perceptions of vaccine safety
grew in importance in explaining willingness to take a given vaccine if offered, particularly among
heavy news consumers in the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson treatment conditions. As the
communication environment highlighted safety concerns around these vaccines, attentive citizens
responded accordingly.
Importantly, hesitancy towards the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines did not
emerge solely – or even primarily – due to actions by domestic health officials. For example,
although Johnson & Johnson had been approved by Health Canada, it had not been administered to
Canadians and Canadian public health agencies had not changed their usage recommendations. We
observe increased aversion towards Johnson & Johnson entirely due to decisions made by foreign
regulatory agencies and related news coverage.
Third, we show that it is not the case that vaccine hesitant groups are more likely to be
repelled by the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines as we might expect if people engaged
in motivated reasoning – accepting and rejecting communication related to the safety and efficacy of
these vaccines based on its convenience for their prior beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines more
generally. Instead, we find that individuals who are more trusting of experts, more supportive of
childhood vaccines, and wearier of the threat posed by COVID-19 are more inclined to differentiate
by brand at the expense of AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson.8 We likely cannot tackle vaccine-
specific hesitancy with communication strategies aimed at those skeptical of vaccines and scientific
expertise generally.
Our results occur in a national context (Canada) where several vaccines have been approved,
but are not equally available to all citizens. It is an open question whether comparative hesitancy
towards certain vaccines would exist absent the potential of receiving another vaccine, or if they are
endogenous to a supply of more than one vaccine. It is also an open question, given skepticism of
specific vaccines, whether countries may actually slow down vaccination rates by procuring multiple
types of vaccine, only some of which citizens will be willing to take if the potential of waiting for
another vaccine exists. Importantly, we find little evidence that overall intention to vaccinate
dwindled as controversy swirled about the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. The share
8 A more mechanical explanation for this result could be floor effects, where vaccine hesitant groups are so resistant to
COVID-19 vaccines that there is little room for the values of outcome variables to fall further in response to random
examined covariates and by vaccine condition. Although we cannot rule out floor effects, it appears quite unlikely.
of citizens reporting that they intend to vaccinate (or already had) increased 4 points by wave 2 (95%
CI = 0.01, 0.06, p = 0.003) and 9 points by wave 3 (95% CI = 0.06, 0.12, p < 0.001).
Nevertheless these findings are still important. It is clear that people are not solely
responsive to information from domestic health authorities. Communications and recommendations
by foreign health agencies – at least when paired with substantial news coverage – are also highly
influential. There is a risk that attentive individuals in countries with limited supply and a less diverse
portfolio of vaccines may turn against the few vaccines that happen to be available depending on
these dynamics. This is perhaps most threatening with AstraZeneca, which is logistically much more
attractive to developing countries than mRNA vaccines. More cross-national research is needed to
observe whether these dynamics hold in contexts with less volume and diversity in vaccine supply.
The importance of these findings is also apparent looking forward. As variants of COVID-19
continue to emerge, governments will need to distribute additional booster shots. This puts added
stress on vaccine supply. People may be less able to get their preferred vaccines immediately and
could respond by holding out until their preferred vaccine becomes available. It appears that at the
time of our study Canadians were willing to wait a considerable amount of time to avoid taking the
AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson vaccines. In the Supplementary Materials we provide evidence
from two additional surveys where we ask respondents for their preferred vaccine and ask them how
long they would be willing to wait for it, rather than an immediately available, randomly assigned
alternative (like AstraZeneca). Only 23% of respondents reported a willingness to take AstraZeneca
or Johnson & Johnson immediately, 41% were willing to wait 12 months or more for their preferred
vaccine, while 36% were willing to tolerate some intermediate delay.
It is also possible that the set of available vaccines will change in Canada and elsewhere in the
future. Variants may emerge that successfully evade the protection of currently available vaccines
and require new products to be developed. And, of course, COVID-19 will not be the last pandemic
we encounter. In either case, we may again see competing vaccines with important variation in their
safety and efficacy profiles, as well as their availability, that together produce vaccine-specific
hesitancy in different national contexts. We need more attentiveness to these dynamics. They may
prove to be immensely consequential in situations where there is some degree of vaccine choice, but
relatively limited supply that prevents people from getting the vaccines they prefer.
There are some important limitations to our study. We evaluate behavioural intention and
attitudes as opposed to observed behaviour. We cannot make strong claims that self-reported
aversion to AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson is indicative of respondents’ behaviour and this is
especially true considering the limited distribution of these vaccines in Canada. Further research
should be conducted in countries more dependent on these vaccines for the success of their mass
vaccination campaigns. Notwithstanding our inability to link attitudes and behavioural intention to
observed behaviour, our results consistently demonstrate the existence of vaccine-specific hesitancy
and a particular aversion to those offered by AstraZeneca.
Acknowledging the existence of vaccine-specific hesitancy raises questions of how to combat
it. Our findings suggest we cannot rely on communication strategies that target those that are
generally skeptical of vaccines. We encourage future research on alternative communication
strategies that can enhance uptake of less-preferred vaccines.
