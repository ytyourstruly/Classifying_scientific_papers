Abstract
Clinical and neuroscientific studies in healthy volunteers have established that the cerebellum
contributes to language comprehension and production. Yet most evidence is correlational and the
exact role of the cerebellum remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the
right cerebellum in unimpaired language comprehension and production using non-invasive brain
stimulation. In this double-blind, sham-controlled experiment, thirty-six healthy participants received
anodal or sham transcranial direct current (tDCS) stimulation to the right cerebellum while
performing a lexical decision, sentence comprehension, verbal fluency and a non-language control
task. Active tDCS did not modulate performance in any of the tasks. Additional exploratory analyses
suggest difficulty-specific performance modulation in the sentence comprehension and lexical
decision task, with tDCS improving performance in easy trials of the sentence comprehension task
and difficult trials in the lexical decision task. Overall, our findings provide no evidence for the
involvement of the right posterior cerebellum in language processing. Further research is needed to
dissociate the influence of task difficulty of the underlying cognitive processes.
