Acknowledgments
I dedicate this dissertation to my parents, Sophie Zheng and Abel Sun. You worked so
hard, made many sacrifices, and immigrated to New Zealand to create a better life for me and
Zheng. Thank you for instilling the value of education in me from a young age, for trusting me to
find my own path, for supporting my educational aspirations and career goals even when that
means being 10,000 (and soon, 14,000) km apart, and for always being proud of me. I hope that
a physical Commencement ceremony will eventually happen so that you can fully experience the
satisfaction of producing a “Dr. Sun”. In the meanwhile, know that I love you and cannot wait to
come home and see you once it is safe to do so.
When I was deciding on who to work with during graduate school, a little bird told me
that Simine Vazire was a “good scientist and a good person”. Nearly five years later, I can say
that this is both completely true and also a complete understatement. Simine, I already had a
deep admiration for you as a scientist before I even arrived in Davis. I admired you for your
leadership in the open science community, the transparency with which you reported your
articles, and your vision and determination in undertaking a ground-breaking study like the
Personality and Interpersonal Roles Study (PAIRS). Since then, you have taught me many things
about being a good scientist. You have shown me what it looks like to stand up for scientific
ideals—and that it’s worth doing, even when things get ugly. You have encouraged me to better
calibrate my claims...I might even be ready to replace “people” with “university students” in the
title of our next paper. Working with you on PAIRS gave me a newfound appreciation of what
constitutes “hard-to-collect data”, taught me that adding any dimension beyond self-reports (e.g.,
informant reports, longitudinal data, experience sampling) can exponentially increase the value
ii
of a research program, and demonstrated the abundance and costlessness of sharing these data
with others without asking for anything in return.
Simine, thank you for also being such an extraordinarily good person. You have been a
true role model for what a good mentor looks like. When I needed advice on various professional
crises, you immediately jumped on the phone to strategize with me. When I wanted to work with
Geoff for a semester, you not only encouraged me to do so, but paid for the visit and for a study
that you weren’t even involved in. When we were in Croatia, you saw an opportunity for us to
hang out and “work” over a biking and donkey-watching expedition. When I had something
worth celebrating, you added extra exclamation marks and enthusiastically overcame your
natural introverted tendencies to CELEBRATE. When I was on the job market, you seemed even
more invested and excited than I was! These are just a few ways in which you’ve constantly
shown me that you have my best interests in mind, that you have my back, and that you care
about both my success and my well-being. I want you to know that I have never for a single
moment taken your kindness for granted, and I look forward to paying it forward.
I would also like to express my heartfelt thanks to the many other faculty members at
Davis and beyond who have contributed to my intellectual development. Mijke Rhemtulla taught
me almost everything I know about structural equation modeling, psychometrics, and simulation,
and has been a patient mentor, helpful collaborator, and inspiring instructor. Rick Robins has
been a wise presence on my advising and dissertation committees, providing valuable feedback
on this dissertation as well as my research and professional development more generally. Wiebke
Bleidorn and Chris Hopwood pulled no punches with their critiques of my work. Their tough
love challenged me to think deeper about the definition of morality and what it means to have a
iii
moral personality. I can’t claim to have a convincing answer just yet, but I’m working on it.
Thanks also to Chris for sending me several key references on the interpersonal circumplex.
Geoff Goodwin became an important mentor and trusted collaborator to me in 2018.
Geoff, I learned so much from visiting your lab for just four months, and our paper together is
the one I’m proudest of so far. Thank you for believing in my ideas, for being such a reliable and
thorough collaborator, for your support on the job market, and for your thoughtful feedback on
this dissertation. I cannot wait to continue our collaborations during my postdoc years and
beyond.
Matthias Mehl, whose innovations in developing the Electronically Activated Recorder
(EAR) made this research possible, has been incredibly generous with his mentorship and
encouragement over the past few years. Matthias, I so appreciate the way you have taken an
interest in my career and kept up with my EAR papers. You always have a kind word for the
directions I have taken with the EAR. I also wanted to thank you for generously taking the time
to coach me on how to respond to challenging questions about the limitations of the EAR.
Luke Smillie, my undergraduate advisor, put me on the right trajectory when he
encouraged me to join the Personality Processes Lab. Luke, your mentorship and encouragement
gave me the confidence to pursue a research career and helped me to develop my passion for
personality science. You built a positive, fun, and supportive lab culture that I hope to recreate
one day soon. The lifelong friendships I formed within the PPL are a big part of the reason why
Melbourne very much feels like home. I am so glad that we have continued to collaborate
throughout my graduate school years, and hope that we will continue to do so for a long time.
I would also like to thank Peggy Kern and Lisa Williams, who were an important part of
my early research training and helped me to reach milestones during my undergraduate years. I
iv
started my research journey at Penn as a research assistant to Peggy in 2014, and it feels like I
am coming full circle to be starting a postdoc there next year. Lisa trusted me enough to give me
the opportunity to co-author my first empirical publication in psychology.
My friends have supported me, inspired me, and added a sense of fun and adventure to
my life. Hayley, it is so wonderful that although you are still in Melbourne, our friendship feels
stronger than ever. I am grateful that our professional paths have converged such that we can
spend quality time together at conferences all over the world. We have shared so many peak
moments axe-throwing in Montréal, hiking in Yosemite, eating gelato in Prague, deep-water
soloing in Croatia, and climbing on Cát Bá Island. Thank you for being such a constant, reliable,
and compassionate presence in my life for so many years.
Michelle, I am so grateful that we immediately became vegan besties in grad school.
Your optimism has inspired me to believe that good things are just around the corner even when
things look bleak. You have helped me see the world through your eyes, and it is a wonderful
world filled with simple pleasures that are already here. I cherish the many deep and meaningful
conversations that we shared, and very much hope that we will be friends for a long time.
Lucy, I am glad that we became closer friends over the last year. I always looked forward
to catching up with you because we always had so much to talk about. You are so full of
surprises and hidden talents, and I admire you for your courage and independence.
Sometimes grad school life can feel little bit too serious. I thank Ted, Elizabeth, and
Glenn for balancing that out with well-measured doses of rowdiness. Ted and PsychHaus hosted
way more than their fair share of parties that brought all the grad students together. Elizabeth and
Glenn brought out my goofy side, inspired me to see and seize opportunities all around, and
opened my heart and mind in many other ways.
Kumara also deserves recognition for tolerating excessive amounts of cuddling and for
filling my heart with joy. He has been the cutest, fluffiest sidekick, and an extremely comforting
presence during the second half of grad school.
As my time in Davis comes to a close, I have come to more fully appreciate—and
continue to discover—its hidden gems. Some of my happiest, most productive hours in Davis
were spent reading, writing, co-working and holding journal club meetings at Cloud Forest Cafe.
I eagerly looked forward to the camaraderie and community of working alongside Olivia, Kailey,
Rick, and Aurélien during Cloud Forest Fridays. TH, thank you for creating such a cozy
atmosphere, for generously connecting me to your private WiFi network, and for letting me stay
and work for unreasonably long sessions. I can only hope to find another space as welcoming as
this in my next cities.
Another gem I only discovered this past year was the Latin dance community at
Ketmoree. I suspected that I would like dancing, but I didn’t know that it would immediately
become a life-changing obsesión. I left every Bachata Tuesday feeling exhilarated, alive,
connected, and inspired by the beauty and skill I had witnessed on the dancefloor. Bachata
Tuesday provided an important weekly reminder that there is much joy to be experienced in life
outside of work. I thank all the leads who patiently showed me the ropes, and Ketmoree for
creating such a safe space. It was also through Ketmoree that I met Jonathan, who quickly
became a loyal friend, dance partner, and occasional gym-buddy. Jonathan, thank you for all the
practice sessions, for the rides to the BachaKiz socials, and for teaching me to love Kizomba. I
look forward to the day when we can all get back on the dance floor.
Sometimes, hidden gems are revealed in the most unexpected ways. Aurélien, you and I
hit it off as friends and intellectual buddies from the moment you arrived in Davis, but it took a
vi
pandemic and a hammock to open my eyes to the sweetness beneath your unassuming facade.
You showed up and wished me a calm happiness during the final stretch of this dissertation. The
intellectual excitement we shared while nerding out over moral psychology reminded me of all
that I love about this job. We experienced the glory of Davis in the springtime, made only more
beautiful by our togetherness. Most profoundly—and healingly—you showed me that I am both
deserving and capable of tenderness. Although we will part ways too soon, it gives me solace to
believe that we will both be better off having had the opportunity to fully know, trust, and accept
one another. You are, and will always be special to me.
Finally, I feel extremely lucky to have been blessed with the PAIRS dataset, which
formed the basis of this dissertation and my graduate school career. This research would not have
been possible without the contributions of past and present members of the Personality and Self-
Knowledge Lab—Brittany Solomon, Kathryn Bollich, Robert Wilson, Kelci Harris, Katie
Finnigan, and Julia Bottesini—who each played substantial roles in designing PAIRS, collecting
and cleaning the PAIRS data, or supervising EAR coding. This research would especially not
have been possible without the research assistants at Wash U who collected the data, the nearly
300 research assistants at UC Davis who coded the EAR files over the past six years, or the
reliable lab managers who coordinated these efforts. Filled-to-the-brim sticker charts and
hundreds of thousands of Qualtrics entries cannot do justice to the brute human effort involved in
listening to file after file—many of which contained nothing but silence or otherwise mundane,
quotidian sounds of day-to-day existence. I am in awe of your collective efforts and feel humbled
to have been a part of this Herculean effort to study what people actually do in everyday life.

Abstract
People are defined in large part by how they relate to and interact with others. Yet, relatively
little research has examined what people actually do to each other during their everyday social
interactions. Across seven chapters, this dissertation explores the connections between
personality traits, interpersonal behaviors, and social consequences. In Chapter 1, I argue for the
centrality of behavior in the conceptualization of interpersonal traits. In Chapter 2, I review the
tradeoffs between different methods of capturing interpersonal behavior in everyday life and
introduce the dataset that I use in the following four empirical chapters. This dataset (N = 287)
includes personality traits, 18 interpersonal behaviors coded from audio recordings of everyday
life, and social consequences reported by friends. The first two empirical chapters (Chapters 3–4)
examine the psychometric properties of the 18 interpersonal behaviors. Chapter 3 explores their
factor structure and suggests that 14 of the behaviors may reflect more general tendencies
towards supportiveness, negativity, mockery, and gossip. Chapter 4 addresses one of the most
fundamental issues in personality psychology—behavioral consistency—by showing that these
interpersonal behaviors show modest amounts of rank-order stability across one year. Chapter 5
demonstrates that personality traits are manifested in concrete interpersonal behaviors and
reveals several gender differences in interpersonal behaviors, but limited implications for friend-
reported social consequences. In the last empirical chapter (Chapter 6), I conduct metric
calibration to make the interpersonal behavioral manifestations of personality traits (based on the
correlates from Chapter 5) more concrete and meaningful by mapping frequencies of behaviors
to otherwise arbitrary scores on personality trait measures. Finally, I conclude by discussing the
complexities of establishing connections between traits and behaviors and the unique value and
challenges of measuring actual behavior (Chapter 7).

Chapter 1: Introduction
[W]e are incapable of giving a complete popular description of personality without
indicating the manner in which the personality in question stimulates or influences other
human beings and the manner in which the behavior of other human beings produces
adjustments or responses in the personality in question. (Allport & Allport, 1921, p. 7)
Historically, interpersonal processes have been the domain of social psychology, whereas
personality psychology has focused on the individual (Tracy, Robins, & Sherman, 2009).
However, as the opening quote by Allport and Allport (1921) illustrates, personality theorists
have always been aware of the potential for intrapsychic variables to influence and be influenced
by other people. Moreover, the development of modern trait taxonomies such as the Big Five and
HEXACO was based on the assumption that socially relevant personality characteristics should
be reflected in language (i.e., the lexical hypothesis; Allport, 1937; Norman, 1967). Far from
existing in vacuums, individuals are inextricably embedded in social contexts, and patterns of
how we relate to and interact with one another help to define who we are as individuals
(Gurtman, 2009; Wiggins, 1979). Cultivating warm and secure relationships, gaining status,
treating others well, and being liked and respected are all outcomes that human beings care
deeply about. Personality psychologists are well-placed to examine individual differences in the
social interaction processes that give rise to these kinds of consequential social outcomes (Back,
in press; Back & Vazire, 2015). This dissertation continues in this spirit of bridging the
traditional divide between social and personality psychology.
This dissertation explores the connections between personality traits, interpersonal
behaviors coded from audio recordings of everyday conversations, and social consequences.
Specifically, I examine a) the interrelations among different behaviors (e.g., are sympathetic
people less likely to blame others?), b) the extent to which people show stable individual
differences in interpersonal behaviors (e.g., are people who apologize more than others across
one week also relatively more apologetic, one year later?), c) the behavioral implications of
personality traits (e.g., do narcissists brag more?), and d) the social consequences of such
behaviors (e.g., are grateful people liked more?). Ultimately, the goal of this dissertation is to
explore the correlates and consequences of individual differences in how people treat each other.
In the present chapter, I argue for the unique role of behavior for understanding the social
consequences of personality, review the role of behavior in the conceptualization of interpersonal
traits, and provide an overview of the dissertation.
The Role of Actual Behavior in Personality Psychology
A central mission of psychology is to describe, explain, and understand the consequences
of what people actually do (Baumeister, Vohs, & Funder, 2007; Furr, 2009). Yet, social–
personality psychologists have lamented that the field has become “a science of self-reports and
finger movements” (Baumeister et al., 2007, p. 396; Furr, 2009). Instead of directly observing
actual behavior—the ordinary activities and social interactions that people naturally engage in as
they go about their daily lives—social and personality psychologists disproportionately rely on
people’s self-reports of how they typically act, recollections of past behavior, hypothetical
predictions about future behavior, and single behaviors that have tenuous connections with what
people normally do in everyday life (e.g., dictator game allocations, Zhao & Smillie, 2015; how
intensely a participant ostensibly shocked someone, Milgram, 1963; how much hot sauce a
participant gave to someone as a measure of aggression, Ritter & Eslea, 2005).
The study of behavior has special significance for personality psychology specifically
(Furr, 2009). At the most basic level, if personality traits comprise relatively stable, enduring
patterns of affect, behavior, and cognition (i.e., the “ABCs”; DeYoung, 2015; McAdams & Pals,
2006), a comprehensive science of personality needs to include all three components of the
ABCs. Here, I argue that behavior is perhaps the most important component of personality and
that this is especially true for interpersonal processes.
Historically, behavioral assessment has played an important role in refuting situationist
critiques of personality. Situationists (e.g., Mischel, 1968) argued that the primary determinant of
behavior was situations and that because people act differently from one situation to the next, the
concept of a trait is not useful. A particularly devastating critique was that the relationships
between traits and behavior are too small to be important (Mischel, 1968). Behavioral
assessment refuted these critiques by demonstrating that people demonstrate substantial
behavioral consistency across situations (Funder & Colvin, 1991; Furr & Funder, 2004).
Moreover, although correlations between traits and single behavioral observations tend to be
low, correlations with behaviors averaged over a sample of situations can be quite high (Epstein,
1979). This moved the field beyond the person–situation debate—which had intensified the
antagonism between personality and social psychology (Kenrick & Funder, 1988)—to a more
productive integration of how behaviors are jointly determined by people, situations, and
interactions between the two (Donnellan, Lucas, & Fleeson, 1989; Fleeson, 2004).
Behavioral assessment also plays an important role in clarifying the concrete, observable
implications of personality trait measures. Although traits cannot be reduced to their behavioral
manifestations, behavior is where other psychological ingredients (e.g., thoughts, feelings,
desires) become concrete and tangibly consequential for oneself and others (Furr, 2009). Thus, a
personality construct is unlikely to be widely interesting or important if it has no behavioral
implications (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955; Furr, 2009). A further issue is that personality traits, like
many other psychological constructs, are typically measured using arbitrary metrics such as a 5-
point scale (Blanton & Jaccard, 2006). Arbitrary metrics lack clear behavioral referents; for
example, it is unclear how a person who scores a “5” on extraversion acts differently compared
to someone who scores a “1”. Measuring actual behavior can help reveal the concrete
implications of scoring at particular levels of personality trait measures, an issue I will address in
Chapter 6.
Finally, in the absence of telepathic communication, behavior is the only component of
the ABCs that can be directly observed by others. Thus, traits can only be judged and have an
impact on other people via their behavioral manifestations. This idea is reflected in models of
the Realistic Accuracy Model (Funder, 1995). Such models assume that people form
interpersonal impressions of targets by observing their behaviors, and that accurate personality
judgment is achieved to the extent that personality traits are manifested in trait-relevant
behaviors that are detected by perceivers. If, on the other hand, people never do anything
relevant to their traits, perceivers will be unable to form accurate judgments of their personality
traits. Thus, even the most well-intentioned person may be judged as cold-hearted and indifferent
if their good intentions never make it out of their heads (e.g., as acts of sympathy, helpfulness,
and gratitude). The lens model can easily be extended beyond personality judgment to other
social consequences (e.g., being liked, having a positive or negative impact on others). In each
case, personality traits only have social consequences via their behavioral manifestations. For
this reason, I argue that behavior plays a particularly central role in interpersonal processes, and
more generally, in bridging the gap between personality and social psychology.

Taxonomies of Interpersonal Traits
Interpersonal traits can be broadly understood as a subset of personality traits that
primarily describe individual differences in what people do to each other (Wiggins, 1979). The
English language contains at least 800 adjectives (e.g., boastful, manipulative, disrespectful,
warm, sympathetic, shy, modest, kind, outgoing, friendly) that capture such traits (Wiggins,
1979). Here, I first review how three major structural models—the Big Five, HEXACO, and
Interpersonal Circumplex—describe common dimensions that underlie the vast landscape of
interpersonal behaviors. This lays the conceptual foundation for contextualizing the interpersonal
behaviors of interest in this dissertation (to be introduced in Chapter 2). In the next section, I
argue that interpersonal behavior is central to the definition of major interpersonal traits.
Trait models.
The Big Five. The Big Five model is an integrative, descriptive model of the major
dimensions of personality variation (John, Naumann, & Soto, 2008). Extraversion describes
tendencies towards being outgoing, sociable, assertive, and talkative. Agreeableness describes
tendencies towards being helpful, sympathetic, respectful, modest, and trusting.
Conscientiousness describes tendencies towards productiveness, orderliness, and responsibility.
Neuroticism describes the tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety, depression,
and anger. Finally, openness describes tendencies towards intellectual curiosity, creativity,
imagination, and aesthetic appreciation. Thus, within the Big Five model, extraversion and
agreeableness are the two traits that are most obviously related to interpersonal behavior (but see
Chapter 5 for a consideration of the interpersonal implications of conscientiousness, neuroticism,
and openness). DeYoung (2015) posits that interpersonal behaviors associated with extraversion
are driven by general reward processes, whereas interpersonal behaviors associated with
agreeableness reflect affiliative bonding and social regulation systems.
HEXACO. The HEXACO model is a six-factor alternative to the Big Five model (Ashton
& Lee, 2007; Ashton et al., 2004). Its eXtraversion, conscientiousness, and openness factors are
parallel to those in the Big Five model. However, the agreeableness, emotionality, and honesty-
humility factors represent a reorganization of the variance associated with the Big Five
agreeableness and neuroticism domains, as well as additional variance not captured within the
classic Big Five (Ashton, Lee, & de Vries, 2014). Specifically, tendencies towards anger are
captured by the neuroticism domain in the Big Five model but are captured by low agreeableness
in the HEXACO model. The HEXACO emotionality domain also captures tendencies towards
sentimentality and empathy that associated with Big Five agreeableness rather than neuroticism.
The sixth factor, honesty-humility (H), describes tendencies towards interpersonal
sincerity (i.e., being unwilling to manipulate others), fairness, greed avoidance, and modesty.
Proponents of HEXACO argue that the H and agreeableness (A) factors are related to different
aspects of individual differences in cooperation or reciprocal altruism (Ashton et al., 2014).
Specifically, within the HEXACO model, H represents tendencies towards active cooperation
(treating others fairly even when you could successfully exploit them), whereas A represents
tendencies towards reactive cooperation (i.e., tolerating and forgiving others’ exploitativeness;
being forgiving, lenient, accommodating, and patient). H is thought to capture moral aspects of
prosocial behavior that are beyond the scope of the Big Five (Ashton & Lee, 2007); however,
there is an ongoing debate about the extent to which H is encompassed by the Big Five. For
example, some researchers argue that H shows substantial conceptual and empirical overlap with
a narrower aspect of Big Five agreeableness, politeness, which captures a consideration of and
respect for others’ needs and desires (Barford, Zhao, & Smillie, 2015; DeYoung, Quilty, &
Peterson, 2007).
Interpersonal circumplex. Finally, the interpersonal circumplex model (IPC; Wiggins,
1979) is a powerful and parsimonious framework for organizing interpersonal phenomena. The
IPC proposes that interpersonal variables (e.g., behaviors, needs, motives, problems, traits) can
be organized along two orthogonal dimensions: agency (dominance vs. submissiveness) and
“getting ahead” (e.g., dominance, power, status), whereas communion captures phenomena
relating to “getting along” (e.g., love, affiliation, friendliness). It is possible to derive broader
(e.g., agreeableness) or narrower (e.g., modesty) interpersonal variables depending on how finely
and at which angles we wish to “slice the circumplex pie” (e.g., into 4ths, 8ths, or 16ths;
Wiggins, 1979, p. 400).

extraversion (E), agreeableness (A), and honesty-humility (H) (Barford et al., 2016; DeYoung et
al., 2013).
The IPC model assumes that every interpersonal variable involves a blend of agency and
communion and that differences between interpersonal variables are largely reducible to
differences along these two fundamental dimensions (Gurtman, 2009; cf. Goodwin, Piazza, &
Rozin, 2014). Thus, each of the interpersonal traits described above can be mapped onto the IPC.
Extraversion, which captures a blend of high warmth and high dominance, typically falls near
60º (Barford et al., 2015; Costa & McCrae, 1989; DeYoung, Weisberg, Quilty, & Peterson,
2013; Pincus, 2002). Big Five and HEXACO agreeableness, which both capture a blend of high
warmth and low dominance, typically fall near 330º (Barford et al., 2015; Costa & McCrae,
1989; DeYoung et al., 2013; Pincus, 2002). Finally, honesty-humility also captures a blend of
high warmth and low dominance, falling along the axis running from unassuming–ingenuous to
arrogant–calculating (i.e., around 315º).
The geometry of the circumplex also provides a direct measure of the conceptual
similarities between different interpersonal behaviors (Gurtman, 1992). The circular ordering
implies that a) behaviors that are closer together (e.g., in the same octant) should be more
positively related than behaviors that are further apart (e.g., in neighboring octants), b) behaviors
that are at right angles to each other (e.g., cold-hearted vs. unassured–submissive) should be
uncorrelated, and c) behaviors that are in opposite octants (e.g., gregarious–extraverted vs.
aloof–introverted) should be negatively correlated (Markey & Markey, 2009).
Behavioral Implications of Interpersonal Traits
Are interpersonal traits primarily defined by overt behavior, or do thoughts and feelings
matter more? For example, can a person truly be agreeable if they often have kind thoughts and
feelings, but never do anything kind or helpful? Thoughts and feelings likely have behavioral
implications (as I discuss below), can change the interpretation of a given behavior (an issue I
consider in Chapters 5 and 7), and are important to understand in their own right. Moreover, in
practice, the ABCs of personality tend to cohere, such that people who experience sympathetic
affect tend to also have trusting cognitions and express considerate behavior (Wilt & Revelle,
2015). Ultimately, however, I argue that interpersonal traits are primarily defined by what people
do to each other.
and HEXACO agreeableness, and honesty-humility to illustrate the role of behavior in the
conceptualization and measurement of major interpersonal traits. Behavior tends to be
emphasized more than affect and cognition in the measurement of Big Five extraversion,
whereas measures of Big Five agreeableness tend to have relatively balanced amounts of ABC
content (Wilt & Revelle, 2015; Zillig, Hemenover, & Dienstbier, 2002). To my knowledge, a
formal analysis of the relative balance of ABC content has not been conducted on measures of
represented in existing measures.
implications. For example, the affective tendency to “Sympathize with others’ feelings”, may
manifest behaviorally as kind, caring actions such as reassuring a friend or giving to charity, and
anticipatory guilt (“Would feel very badly for a long time if I were to steal from someone”)
predisposes people to act in ethical ways (Cohen, Panter, & Turan, 2012). Similarly, a cognitive
belief that “I think that I am entitled to more respect than the average person is” would likely be
manifested as boastful and condescending actions. Thus, interpersonal behaviors are central to
each of these traits and are likely facilitated by accompanying affective and cognitive tendencies.
What might these trait conceptualizations imply about the everyday interpersonal
behaviors that should be associated with each of these traits? To provide some examples, a)
extraverts should act in more talkative, sociable, gregarious, dominant, attention-seeking, and
self-disclosing ways, b) people who are high on Big Five agreeableness should be more helpful,
express more sympathy and concern, express more gratitude, and be less antagonistic (e.g., less
likely to argue with, criticize, and insult others), c) people who are high on HEXACO
agreeableness should express less interpersonal anger, be more accommodating, and be less
likely to criticize, complain about, and argue with others, and d) people who are high on honesty-
humility should be less likely to act in boastful and condescending ways, and less likely to
manipulate, deceive, cheat, and take advantage of others.

A final issue is whether interpersonal behaviors should be related to traits in a
decontextualized or context-specific way. Some theorists have conceptualized traits as being
“nonconditional” and “decontextualized” (e.g., McAdams & Pals, 2006), implying that the
expression of traits should not depend on situational features. Other trait theorists argue that
traits are contextualized (e.g., Allport, 1937); for example, Tellegen (1981) defined traits as “the
disposition to exhibit reaction R under condition S” (p. 219). This perspective implies that traits
require appropriate eliciting stimuli in order to be manifested in behavior (DeYoung, 2015). The
relevant eliciting stimuli may be more frequently present for some behaviors than for others. For
example, individual differences in talkative, outgoing, boastful, argumentative, and helpful
behaviors have the opportunity to manifest whenever other people are around. Other behaviors
may have more specific elicitors. For example, expressions of gratitude are only relevant when a
person perceives that others have done something to benefit them (Algoe, 2012), individual
differences in forgiving and patient (vs. retaliatory and angry) behaviors only have the
opportunity to manifest in response to the transgressions of others, and it makes no sense to
express sympathy in the absence of a suffering other.
These potential context-dependencies imply that interpersonal traits may more strongly
predict interpersonal behaviors when relevant eliciting stimuli are present and that the
association between interpersonal traits and behaviors may be weaker when generalizing across
all situations. If interpersonal traits are still moderately to strongly correlated with interpersonal
behavior without considering context, this would imply either that interpersonal traits have
decontextualized behavioral implications, or that the relevant eliciting stimuli are often present.
If, on the other hand, interpersonal traits or only weakly or are not associated with theoretically
related behaviors, this would be consistent with conditional, contextualized conceptualizations of
traits.
Overview of the Dissertation
In this chapter, I have made the case for studying actual behavior. Behavior is usually
considered the ultimate outcome of interest—something that has a greater impact on the world
and other people than mere thoughts and feelings. Behavior is the only medium by which
thoughts and feelings can have an impact on others, and is the only information that others can
use to judge a person. For this reason, behavior is especially central to the conceptualization of
major interpersonal traits. Finally, studying behavior provides the opportunity to test whether
self-reports of interpersonal traits are manifested in interpersonal behaviors across an average of
all situations.
Researchers have made substantial progress towards understanding interpersonal
behaviors in laboratory settings (for a review, see Back, in press). Studies in the lens model
tradition have uncovered behavioral cues that underlie the accuracy of personality judgments
(e.g., Borkenau & Liebler, 1992; Cuperman & Ickes, 2009; Funder & Sneed, 1993). For
example, Funder and Sneed (1993) found that extraverts tended to speak in a loud voice, were
more expressive in their face, voice, or gestures, initiated humor, and were less likely to express
insecurity during videotaped interactions with strangers. Funder and Sneed also found that
agreeable people tended to laugh more and express warmth, and were less likely to brag, exhibit
condescending behavior, and express skepticism or cynicism. Other studies have demonstrated
that individual differences in interpersonal behavior show substantial stability across situations
(e.g., when interacting with different interaction partners who were instructed to act dominant,
1 3
submissive, agreeable, or quarrelsome; Leikas, Lönnqvist, & Verkasalo, 2012) and across time
(Funder & Colvin, 1991).
As valuable as these efforts are, behaviors observed in controlled experimental settings
are not representative of how people interact with the full range of interaction partners and in the
variety of situations they face in their everyday lives. Psychological scientists also need a method
for capturing interpersonal behavior in the moments when it naturally happens—an issue I turn
to in Chapter 2. Specifically, in Chapter 2, I review methods for observing behavior in everyday
life, introduce the 18 interpersonal behaviors of interest in this dissertation, and describe the
dataset that I use in the four empirical chapters.
I begin the empirical component of the dissertation by examining the psychometric
properties of these interpersonal behaviors (Chapters 3 and 4). In Chapter 3, I explore the factor
structure of these interpersonal behaviors. Specifically, what are the broader dimensions that
underlie these specific behaviors? What does this reveal about the shared psychological meaning
of different interpersonal behaviors? Next, Chapter 4 addresses one of the most fundamental
issues in personality psychology—behavioral consistency. To do so, I test the rank-order stability
of interpersonal behaviors across one year. In other words, which interpersonal behaviors might
more strongly reflect stable individual differences vs. fleeting situational influences?
In Chapter 5, I explore the correlates and consequences of interpersonal behaviors. The
first goal of this chapter is to investigate how personality traits are manifested in concrete
interpersonal behaviors. For example, how does an agreeable person treat others in their
everyday interactions? Are “interpersonal” traits such as extraversion and agreeableness more
strongly correlated with everyday interpersonal behaviors than are less interpersonal traits such
as neuroticism and self-esteem? This will clarify the behavioral implications of personality traits,
1 4
as well as the psychological meaning of everyday interpersonal behaviors. Second, I will explore
gender differences in everyday interpersonal behaviors. Third, I will examine whether these
interpersonal behaviors have any implications for friend-reported social consequences.
Finally, Chapter 6 aims to make the interpersonal behavioral manifestations of
personality traits (based on the correlates from Chapter 5) more concrete and meaningful by
mapping frequencies of behaviors to otherwise arbitrary scores on personality trait measures. In
doing so, I further illustrate the utility of measuring actual behavior.

Chapter 2: Measuring Interpersonal Behavior in Everyday Life
An ideal method for measuring real-world interpersonal behavior should be valid (i.e.,
accurately reflects actual behavior), comprehensive (i.e., capture a large amount of visual and
auditory information about all interaction partners and across a range of contexts), unobtrusive
(i.e., does not change the behavior of the participants and their interaction partners), scalable
(i.e., such that it is feasible to achieve large samples of participants, interactions, and behaviors),
and able to capture psychologically meaningful interpersonal behaviors (i.e., beyond just the
quantity of social interactions). In the first part of this chapter, I review the tradeoffs involved in
different methods for measuring everyday interpersonal behaviors, and argue that the
Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR), an unobtrusive audio recording device, provides the
best possible balance between these goals. In the second part of this chapter, I introduce the
interpersonal behaviors and the dataset to be used in subsequent empirical chapters.
Methods for Measuring Everyday Interpersonal Behavior
Self-report methods. The Act Frequency Approach (AFA) was developed by Buss and
Craik (1980) as an effort to clarify the behavioral implications of traits and to monitor “what
people do all day” (Buss & Craik, 1983, p. 119). This method involved asking participants to
provide retrospective self-reports of either whether or not they had ever engaged in each act (e.g.,
“I continued to apologize for the minor mistake”, “I gave advice, although none was requested”;
Buss & Craik, 1983), and if so, how often they did so (e.g., rarely, sometimes, or often) within a
designated time interval. The AFA fell out of fashion (but is still occasionally used, e.g.,
Chapman & Goldberg, 2017) after several significant criticisms emerged. Perhaps the most
influential was Block’s (1989) critique that “the act frequency approach” was a misnomer,
because “nowhere have acts been directly observed in the AFA” (p. 237). Block questioned the
1 6
validity of relying on retrospective self-reports of behavior across long periods of time. A further
issue is that rather than providing true frequency metrics, the AFA relied on arbitrary metrics
(e.g., how many acts counts as “rarely” vs. “sometimes”?).
The Experience Sampling Method (ESM; Larson & Csikszentmihalyi, 1983; Scollon,
Chu, & Diener, 2003) overcomes some of the problems associated with retrospective self-reports
such as the AFA. In the ESM, researchers can ask participants to complete behavioral checklists
of their behaviors across a short period of time (e.g., whether or not they interacted with
someone in the past hour; Sun, Harris, & Vazire, 2019), multiple times per day for several days.
By simply asking participants about whether or not they engaged in a specific behavior across a
relatively recent and short period of time, the ESM overcomes some of the retrospective biases
associated with trying to remember one’s behaviors across a longer period of time. By averaging
across all reports, it is also possible to derive true frequency metrics (e.g., the percentage of
hours in which a participant interacted with someone). Despite these advantages over
retrospective self-reports, ESM reports are still susceptible to other validity issues, including
participants’ unwillingness or inability to accurately report their momentary behaviors (Gosling,
John, Craik, & Robins, 1998; Sun & Vazire, 2019). The ESM also involves high participant
burden because it requires people to actively respond to surveys multiple times each day. This
limits the number of behavioral observations that can reasonably be sampled. Finally, because
researchers cannot control whether or not participants complete all reports, it is possible that
people systematically miss reports when they are engaging in specific interpersonal behaviors
(cf. Sun, Rhemtulla, & Vazire, under review).
Behavioral observation methods.
1 7
Comprehensive in-person and video observation. In 1949, a team of eight observers took
turns every half hour to physically observe and meticulously record every aspect of one boy’s
day (Barker & Wright, 1951). In a similar spirit, Craik’s (2000) research team followed
participants around with a handheld video camera. Both approaches would provide a
comprehensive description of everyday interpersonal behavior observable to the eye and the ear
across all contexts in a person’s life, but the obtrusiveness of such methods would likely change
the behavior of the participants and those around them. The resource-intensiveness of such
methods also reduces the length of observations and sample sizes that would be feasible to
obtain.
Scalable and less obtrusive methods. There are other more scalable methods, but existing
methods tend to be limited in the type or context of social behavior that can be captured. Much
of people’s life takes place online nowadays, leaving plentiful behavioral traces of social
interactions (especially language use) that occur via social media platforms (e.g., Facebook and
Twitter; Park et al., 2015; Youyou, Kosinski, & Stillwell, 2015). However, digital footprints only
capture one aspect of how people interact with one another. We also need methods for capturing
what happens during in-person, face-to-face social interactions.
Mobile sensing methods provide objective and highly-scalable measures of quantitative
social behaviors (e.g., calling, texting, number of social interaction partners; Harari et al., 2019),
but such technologies are less well-suited for capturing qualitative aspects of social interactions
(e.g., helping, gossiping, criticizing). Wearable cameras that capture pictures of people’s natural
environments on a fixed interval (e.g., every 30 s; Brown, Blake, & Sherman, 2017) can provide
some visual information about one’s social context (e.g., number and identity of interaction
partners, facial expressions of interaction partners), but provide limited information about what
1 8
participants are doing during these social interactions (and no auditory information). Finally,
smart-home devices contain video and microphone sensors that could be used to passively
observe social behavior, but only in the context of the home (Nelson & Allen, 2018).
All of these methods validly capture actual behavior and are relatively unobtrusive (at
least compared to being followed around by a team of observers) and at least somewhat scalable
(i.e., less labor-intensive than hiring teams of observers and videographers, though behavioral
coding of audiovisual data would still be labor-intensive). However, these methods are limited in
their comprehensiveness (i.e., because they capture limited mediums or contexts of social
interactions) or their ability to capture psychologically meaningful interpersonal behaviors that
happen during face-to-face interactions.
The Electronically Activated Recorder. In this dissertation, I use a method that arguably
achieves the best balance between the goals of validity, comprehensiveness, unobtrusiveness,
scalability, and psychological meaningfulness—the EAR (Mehl, 2017; Mehl, Pennebaker, Crow,
Dabbs, & Price, 2001). The EAR is an unobtrusive wearable recording device that records brief
audio snippets of participants’ ambient sounds. These recordings are later coded by human
observers for audible behaviors of interest, such as social behaviors. The EAR can be
programmed to record snippets of different lengths (e.g., 30 seconds), at different intervals (e.g.,
every 10 minutes), with blackout periods (e.g., only recording during hours in which the
participant is likely to be awake). This sampling strategy better preserves participant privacy and
enables larger sample sizes than would be possible with a continuous recording protocol (Mehl,
2017). Because the EAR passively records behavior without requiring participants to respond
(i.e., involves low participant burden), this increases the number of social interactions that can be
1 9
feasibly captured. The main constraints on scalability are the availability of human coders and
time.
Previous validation studies have tested whether the EAR is in fact unobtrusive. Such
studies have shown that although people reported being generally aware of the EAR, they also
reported that the EAR generally did not change their behavior or the behavior of others around
them, and that they generally did not feel impeded in their daily activities (Manson & Robbins,
2017; Mehl & Holleran, 2007). Participants cannot turn the EAR off and cannot tell when it is
recording; however, to further preserve privacy, participants are allowed to take the EAR off
when they do not want to be recorded and can choose to delete any files that they do not want the
researchers to hear. In practice, participants tend to be highly compliant, wearing the EAR for
more than 85% of their waking hours (Manson & Robbins, 2017; Mehl & Holleran, 2007), and
deleting well under 1% of sound files (Mehl, Robbins, & Deters, 2012). Thus, the EAR generates
a representative acoustic log of peoples’ everyday lives, allowing researchers to eavesdrop on the
everyday social interactions that people naturally engage in.
Of course, as with any method, the EAR has limitations. Some limitations are general to
behavioral observation methods. First, some consequential interpersonal behaviors, such as
deception, cannot be easily captured because they require that the researchers know the truth.
Second, by definition, rare interpersonal acts such as punching someone in the face or saving a
life would be difficult to observe using naturalistic methods, because they do not occur
frequently enough. Third, the EAR observers provide an external, third-person perspective—one
that is complementary to the perspective of the self, who has exclusive access to the intended
interpretation of their behaviors. EAR observers have access to only the raw behavior and not the
full psychological context. Still, because people regularly act as observers of others’ behavior in
2 0
everyday life without full knowledge of their underlying motivations and intentions, this external
perspective is socially and theoretically important (Mehl, Gosling, & Pennebaker, 2006).
Fourth, EAR-based behavioral observations are not necessarily “objective”. Whereas
some behaviors can be relatively objectively coded at a “molecular” level (e.g., whether or not a
person was interacting with someone), many psychologically interesting social behaviors (e.g.,
whether someone was helpful or sympathetic) require observers to form subjective, “molar”
judgments. Finally, one EAR-specific limitation is that by capturing only audible information,
the EAR is unable to capture nonverbal information (e.g., eye-rolling, smiling) that may provide
important context on the nature of people’s interpersonal interactions. However, all things
considered, the EAR is optimized for capturing audible social interactions, and especially verbal
behaviors expressed in everyday conversations (Mehl, 2017).
A handful of studies have successfully used the EAR to measure interpersonal behaviors
in everyday life. The EAR has most typically been used to measure quantitative aspects of social
interactions (e.g., time spent alone, time spent on the phone, number of interaction partners;
Mehl et al., 2006; Mehl & Pennebaker, 2003; Milek et al., 2018) or language use measured via
transcripts of participants’ conversations (e.g., Mehl et al., 2006; Robbins, López, Weihs, &
Mehl, 2014; Sun, Schwartz, Son, Kern, & Vazire, 2020; Tackman et al., 2019). Fewer studies
have examined qualitative aspects of interpersonal behavior (i.e., what happens during a social
interaction). Most of these studies have focused on one or two such behaviors at a time (e.g.,
conversational depth, Mehl et al., 2010; Milek et al., 2018; conversational depth and self-
disclosure, Sun, Harris, et al., 2019; varieties of gossip, Robbins & Karan, 2020; swearing and
arguing, Holtzman, Vazire, & Mehl, 2010; Mehl et al., 2006; cf. Kaplan et al., 2018), and have
typically explored how such behaviors correlate with either the Big Five traits or one or two
2 1
specific traits (e.g., happiness, narcissism, mindfulness; Mehl et al., 2010; Holtzman et al., 2010;
Kaplan et al., 2018).
More recently, Bollich and colleagues (2016) explored whether the EAR could be used to
assess 14 behaviors that were intended to be indicative of moral character. In developing their
coding scheme, they aimed to capture a range of behaviors that were a) audibly detectable, b)
occurred with some regularity in everyday life, and c) could be reliably assessed based on pilot
coding. These researchers aimed to capture prototypically virtuous behaviors that had a prosocial
or antisocial focus (while noting that moral conduct is broader than prosocial or antisocial
actions). In the resulting coding scheme, affection, gratitude, praise, sympathy, helping,
apologizing, and optimism were considered to be indicative of positive moral conduct, whereas
sarcasm, bragging, condescension, complaining, criticism, blame, and pessimism were
considered to be indicative of negative moral conduct.
The goal of Bollich and colleagues’ (2016) study was primarily psychometric, aiming to
establish that their set of behaviors can be reliably coded and reflect stable individual
differences. Using two small samples of participants who had worn the EAR across two
weekends separated by four weeks (N = 11) or 10 weeks (N = 73), they showed that
Sample 1 Sample 2
individual differences in these behaviors were moderately stable (mean r = .47 over 4 weeks,
mean r = .52 over 10 weeks) and comparable to the stability of individual differences in neutral
language behaviors (e.g., the use of articles, prepositions, and adverbs). In doing so, Bollich and
colleagues demonstrated that more complex and subjective interpersonal behaviors can be
reliably coded from EAR recordings.
Interpersonal Behaviors Included in this Dissertation
2 2
In this dissertation, I examine a set of 18 behaviors that includes almost all of the
behaviors measured by Bollich and colleagues (2016, described above, except for expressing
affection), as well as five additional behaviors—being funny, negative gossip, neutral or positive
gossip, teasing others, and expressions of insecurity. Rather than being informed by a specific
theoretical framework, this set of behaviors was intended to capture everyday interpersonal
phenomena that are intuitively interesting and meaningful to psychologists and ordinary people
alike, and could be captured using the EAR (i.e., are potentially audible, occur with some
regularity in everyday life, and can be coded reliably). Thus, this dissertation is grounded in an
approach that values comprehensive description of real-world phenomena (Rozin, 2001) and
recognizes the importance of “know[ing] the thing we are trying to explain” (Asch, 1952/1987,
p. 65). In this way, I take an exploratory, hypothesis-generating approach, rather than seeking to
test specific hypotheses. Nevertheless, in each of the empirical chapters (Chapters 3–6), I review
relevant theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence to provide a context for interpreting the
results.
Towards this end, it is worth considering how the final set of behaviors relates to the
major interpersonal traits of extraversion, agreeableness, and honesty-humility, as well as the
IPC (introduced in Chapter 1). None of the behaviors seem central to the definition of
extraversion. Most of the behaviors are most conceptually-related to high (sympathy, praise,
help, optimism, gratitude, apologizing) or low Big Five agreeableness (bragging, condescension,
teasing, blame, sarcasm, criticism, negativity, complaining). Bragging and condescension
seemed relevant to low honesty-humility, whereas gratitude is conceptually-related to high
honesty-humility. Expressions of insecurity and being funny did not seem obviously connected
2 3
with the three major interpersonal traits. Thus, overall, the set of 18 behaviors primarily reflects
Big Five agreeableness-related behaviors.
approximate locations based on a) behavioral mapping of analogous behaviors during dyadic
interactions, b) analogous specific items within IPC measures, c), conceptual similarity to the
constructs captured by IPC “slices” (e.g., based on the label for the slice), d) Responsibility
Exchange Theory, which outlines the effects of thanking, bragging, blaming, and apologizing on
perceived competence and warmth (Chaudhry & Loewenstein, 2019), and e) other empirical
studies that have mapped analogous self-report measures of the behaviors measured in this study
onto the IPC. Although this coding scheme was not designed with the IPC in mind, the 18
behaviors appear to capture various combinations of high and low warmth and dominance.
Thus, taken as a whole, this set of interpersonal behaviors broadly captures tendencies
towards warmth, antagonism, provocativeness, self-assurance, and submissiveness that
potentially have consequences for the well-being of oneself or others and are psychologically
interesting in their own right. Across two additional coding tasks, the larger dataset also includes
measures of other interpersonal behaviors. In this dissertation, I chose to focus only on
qualitative aspects of interpersonal behavior, and thus did not include data on quantitative
aspects of interpersonal behavior (e.g., being alone vs. around others, interacting vs. not, number
and type of interaction partners). The larger dataset also includes codings of other qualitative
aspects of social interaction (e.g., self-disclosure, conversational depth; reported in Sun, Harris,
et al., 2019). I did not include these variables in this dissertation because they were coded using
2 4
scale-based judgments (based on an overall impression of all audio recordings in a given hour)
rather than concrete, non-arbitrary behavioral counts based on individual audio recordings.

Method Overview
Ethics and Open Practices Statement
I used data from Wave 1 and 4 (baseline and one-year follow-up; from now on referred to
as “Year 1” and “Year 2,” respectively) of the longitudinal Personality and Interpersonal Roles
Study (PAIRS). These were two of the three waves (Waves 1, 4, and 7) that contained EAR
codings. I did not include data from Wave 7 (two-year follow-up) because these audio files were
not coded for the behaviors of interest in this dissertation. Data collection and coding procedures
were approved by Institutional Review Boards at Washington University in St. Louis (IRB ID:
201206090; Study Title: Personality and Intimate Relationships Study) and University of
California, Davis (IRB ID: 669518–15; Study Title: Personality and Interpersonal Roles Study).
Several published articles have used the PAIRS dataset (for a full list of citations, see
Letzring, 2018; Finnigan & Vazire, 2018; Sun et al., 2019; Sutu, Serrano, Schultz, Jackson, &
Damian, 2019; Wilson, Harris, & Vazire, 2015) and other EAR-coded interpersonal behaviors
(Sun & Vazire, 2019; Sun, Harris, et al., 2019). However, this dissertation provides the first
report of analyses involving the interpersonal behaviors described below.
Below, I describe the measures and procedures relevant to the current dissertation.
preregister any of these analyses because the data were collected years ago and I was familiar
with the dataset and had run some preliminary analyses before conceptualizing this dissertation.
Thus, all results are exploratory and any interesting patterns should be interpreted with caution.
Participants and Procedure Overview
PAIRS involved 434 students at Washington University in St. Louis, who were recruited
in 2012 and 2013 via flyers and classroom announcements across the campus. Participants
completed a battery of self-report questionnaires during an initial laboratory-based assessment
($20 compensation), and nominated friends who reported on the participants’ traits and
interpersonal outcomes. These self- and friend-reported measures are described in Chapter 5. For
the next two weeks, participants completed experience sampling method (ESM) measures four
times per day (for a 1 in 10 chance of winning $100 if all ESM surveys were completed) that
were not relevant to this dissertation. In addition, most participants (N = 311) wore the EAR for
the first week of the ESM protocol ($20 compensation), providing audio recordings of their
everyday lives that were later coded for interpersonal behaviors (described below). One year
later (Year 2), 153 (49.2%) of the participants who wore the EAR in Year 1 wore the EAR for
another week. Recruitment ended at the end of the semester in which the research team had
recruited at least 400 participants in Year 1.
I use behavioral data from both Years 1 and 2 to examine the factor structure and rank-
order stability of these behaviors across one year. I use self-report, informant report, and
behavioral data from Year 1 to answer questions about the correlates of between-person
participants included in the different analyses (inclusion criteria are described below).

EAR Procedures
EAR data collection. 311 participants wore the EAR for 6–8 days. The EAR was
implemented through the iEAR app using an iPod Touch device. The EAR component of the
study was optional, was only offered during non-summer months of the study, and was not an
option when all of the researchers’ iPod Touches were in use by other participants. The EAR was
programmed to record 30 s audio snippets of participants’ ambient sounds, every 9.5 min from 7
a.m.–2 a.m. Participants were encouraged to wear the EAR as much as possible and to wear it
clipped to a waistband or the outside of their pockets (i.e., not inside a bag or pocket). Although
participants had no way to tell when the device was recording, they were told that they could
decide to not wear the EAR at any time for any reason. After 3–4 days, participants returned to
the lab to upload their data (due to device memory limitations) and then continued wearing the
device before returning it after another 3–4 days.

Upon returning the device at the end of the week, participants received a compact disk
with their recordings, so that they could listen to and erase any files they did not want the
researchers to hear. In Year 1, only a few participants (n = 15) chose to erase a total of 99 files.
After deleting these files, along with files from six participants who withdrew, and one
participant who only had silent recordings (suggesting that the microphone malfunctioned),
152,592 usable recordings from 304 participants remained. In Year 2, only a few participants (n
= 6) chose to erase a total of 44 files. After deleting these files, 84,145 usable recordings from
153 participants remained.
EAR codings. Although participants could have thanked others or expressed sympathy
(for example) through inaudible non-verbal behaviors or computer-mediated communications, it
was only possible for us to detect these behaviors when they were spoken out loud. Thus,
research assistants from the University of California, Davis first listened to the EAR recordings
from Year 1 and Year 2 and transcribed the words that participants spoke, in order to identify the
files that contained participants’ decipherable speech. The full details of the transcription
procedure are available elsewhere (Sun et al., 2020). A total of 31,209 files (Year 1) and 14,685
files (Year 2) contained at least one decipherable word spoken by the participant.
In a separate task, research assistants listened to only the files that contained participants’
decipherable speech and coded the interpersonal behaviors that participants enacted in each 30 s
from Bollich et al. (2016). Any single file could contain and be coded for more than one
interpersonal behavior (e.g., a participant could be coded as expressing sympathy and blaming
someone in the same file).

Note. EAR coders were asked to “Check all behaviors that apply to the participant during this
file”. For the ESM-matched files in Year 1, coders listened for the full list of 18 behaviors. To
simplify this task for the non-ESM-matched Year 1 files and all Year 2 files, I split up the task,
such that one team of coders listened for behaviors 1–9, and the other team of coders listened for
behaviors 10–18. Behaviors that were measured in Bollich et al. (2016) are marked with *.

Because research assistants joined and left the lab at different times (as this coding
project spanned several years), each participant was coded by a different set of coders. Coders
listened to each 30 s file that contained speech, recorded all behaviors (described below) that
applied to the participant during the file, then moved onto the next 30 s file that contained
speech. Coders listened to the files in chronological order and coded all files for a given
participant before moving onto the next participant. Some coders were involved in multiple tasks
(Year 1 transcription, Year 2 transcription, Year 1 interpersonal behavior coding, Year 2
interpersonal behavior coding), but they never coded the same participant across different tasks
or years. If coders left the lab before they coded all speech-containing files for a given
participant, their participant was re-assigned to a new coder. If a coder had coded ≥ 80% of the
speech-containing files, I considered their codings to be complete and retained them; otherwise, I
excluded them.
For the Year 1 files, the research assistants initially only coded the 7,784 speech-
containing files that occurred during the hours that matched the ESM reports (i.e., 11 a.m.–12
p.m., 2 p.m.–3 p.m., 5 p.m.–6 p.m., and 8 p.m.–9 p.m.). The original coding scheme used
added additional coders halfway through the ESM-matched-hour codings, I decided to expand
to clarify the meaning of each behavior. For these codings, I aimed for four coders per
participant and ended up with 267 participants who had four or more coders, 16 participants who
had three coders, and 4 participants who had two coders.
I later decided to also obtain codings for the speech-containing files outside of these
ESM-matched hours, to increase the reliability of the between-person estimates. Before coding
3 3
the non-ESM-matched hours, I modified the coding protocol again to try to improve the
reliability of the codings. Instead of coding all 18 behaviors in the full checklist, I split up the list
into two lists, such that one team of coders only coded nine behaviors, and the other team of
aimed for three coders per participant (i.e., six coders coded each participant, but two teams of
three coders each coded different sets of behaviors). Due to time constraints, most participants
were only double-coded. Specifically, for the first checklist, 70 participants were at least triple-
coded, 181 were double-coded, and 34 had only one coder. For the second checklist, 85
participants were at least triple-coded, 181 were double-coded, and 19 had only one coder.
Coders used this split checklist to code all speech-containing files in Year 2, aiming for
three coders per participant. For the first checklist, 126 participants were triple-coded, 13 were
double-coded, and 2 had only one coder. For the second checklist, 121 participants were triple-
coded, 16 were double-coded, and 2 had only one coder.
more reliable estimates of average interpersonal behavior, I only included participants who had
at least 20 files that contained speech in the analyses for the respective year. Only participants
who had enough speech-containing files in both Year 1 and Year 2 were included in the rank-
order stability analyses.

a given behavior; ⍵ = omega reliability estimate based on a CFA model with coders as

Aggregating codings. To estimate the percentage of speech-containing files for a given
participant that contained each interpersonal behavior, I first aggregated the codings across each
coder, for each participant that had at least 20 speech-containing files. These coder–participant
aggregates were used as indicators when estimating the inter-reliability of the codings (described
below) and for latent variables in the stability analyses (described in Chapter 4). Then, for each
participant, I aggregated the codings across all available coders. These observed estimates were

the range of 1–11% of everyday conversations), and the base rates were fairly similar across the
two years. The most common interpersonal behaviors involved being funny, helping others,
expressing sympathy, and complaining (> 8.9% in Year 1); the rarest behaviors were blaming
others, apologizing, bragging, and being condescending (< 2.2% in Year 1).
Inter-coder reliability. To estimate the extent to which sets of coders were able to
reliably differentiate participants who expressed each behavior more or less often, I used the
omega reliability coefficient (McDonald, 1999), estimated from a confirmatory factor analysis
(CFA) model in which the indicators were aggregates based on each coder, with equal loadings
and residuals. In Year 1, there were seven indicators in total, based on two “groups” of coders: 1)
aggregates based on files recorded during ESM-matched hours in Year 1, and 2) aggregates
based on files recorded outside of ESM-matched hours in Year 1. In Year 2, there were three
indicators, which were based on coder aggregates across all files. Within each group (Year 1
ESM-matched, Year 1 non-matched, Year 2 all files), for a given participant (e.g., participant 1),
all ratings from coder 1 were from the same coder (e.g., research assistant 1). However, for a
different participant (e.g., participant 2), coder 1 could have been a different research assistant
(e.g., research assistant 2). To model the interchangeability of coders within each group, I
constrained all coder loadings to be equal (within each group), and constrained the residual
variances to be equal (within each group). However, the loadings and residuals were free to vary
between each group. I fit a separate CFA model for each behavior, for each year, using the R
package lavaan (Rosseel, 2012).

Year 2
.31–.62 in Year 1, and between .06–.55 in Year 2.
Data Analyses
Models and specific analytic procedures for each research question will be described in
their respective chapters. Here, I describe analytic decisions that apply across the dissertation. I
conducted analyses using the R programming environment (Version 3.6.3; R Core Team, 2018).
Average correlations or reliability coefficients and comparisons of correlations or factor loadings
(e.g., using t-tests) were computed after applying the Fisher r-to-z transformation (and, where
applicable, the reverse transformation to transform the mean z back to an r). Sensitivity power
analyses were conducted using the R package pwr (Champely et al., 2017).
Because some participants had fewer coders than the intended number (e.g., 2 coders
rather than 3), some participants had missing data on some coder aggregates. To handle missing
data in these cases (and missing data on other variables, including scale items), I used pairwise
complete observations for analyses involving observed variables, and full information maximum
likelihood estimation for analyses involving latent variables. This approach makes use of all
available information (compared to listwise deletion, for example).

Chapter 3: Factor Structure of Everyday Interpersonal Behaviors
Factor analyses of self-report measures have shown over and over again that large sets of
psychological variables can be reduced into a smaller number of higher-order dimensions (e.g.,
(Ashton et al., 2004; De Raad, Perugini, Hrebícková, & Szarota, 1998; Saucier & Goldberg,
2001). Following this logic, in this chapter, I explore the factor structure of the 18 interpersonal
behaviors. As explained in Chapter 1, the selection of the 18 interpersonal behaviors was based
on practical considerations and intuitions about which behaviors would be most interesting to
capture, rather than a particular theoretical framework. In this chapter, I explore whether an
informative and coherent structure will emerge from a set of behaviors that were chosen without
a particular structure in mind. Rather than aiming to discover the “true” underlying structure of
these interpersonal behaviors (i.e., attempting to carve nature at its joints), I had two purposes in
mind in exploring whether the 18 behaviors can be summarized by a smaller set of data-driven
dimensions.
First, composites of conceptually linked behaviors tend to be more reliable than
individual behaviors (Block, 1989; Jaccard, 1974; Spearman, 1910). For example, Jaccard (1974)
found that self-reports of dominance correlated at a mean of .20 with each of 40 self-reported
behaviors, but up to .64 with the aggregate of these 40 behaviors. He therefore concluded that
“measures of personality should be highly related to multiple act criteria, but not necessarily to
single act criteria” (p. 362). In other words, to the extent that it is possible to derive broader and
more reliable composites of conceptually linked behaviors, behavioral composites (compared to
individual behaviors) should show higher rank-order stability (Chapter 4) and larger correlations
with personality traits and social consequences (Chapter 5). Thus, the primary purpose of this
chapter is to derive composites that would allow me to examine the rank-order stability and
3 8
correlates of not only individual behaviors but also behavioral composites in subsequent
chapters.
A secondary purpose is to generate hypotheses about the more general interpersonal
meanings, causes, or functions that specific interpersonal behaviors share. In other words, what
are the broader traits that underlie specific behavioral manifestations? Because the set of
behaviors included in this study was not designed to comprehensively sample the interpersonal
space, these analyses cannot speak to the “true” factor structure of interpersonal behaviors
(unlike, for example, Wiggins, 1979). However, factor analysis can at least help to reveal the
psychological meaning of everyday expressions of the interpersonal behaviors included in this
dissertation. For example, if gratitude loads onto the same factor (but in a reverse direction) as
bragging and condescension, this might suggest that everyday expressions of gratitude primarily
reflect humility. If, however, gratitude loads more strongly onto the same factor as praise,
sympathy, and helping, this might suggest that gratitude reflects general interpersonal warmth.
Plausible Factor Structures
Which factors might emerge? In other words, what are the common meanings that the
different interpersonal behaviors might share? Although I did not have strong theoretical
predictions before conducting the analyses, it is worth considering different factor structures that
might have plausibly emerged.
Intuitive groupings. One possibility is that the behaviors will simply separate into a
positive cluster (gratitude, praise, sympathy, helping, apologizing, optimism, funny, neutral or
positive gossip) and a negative cluster (negative gossip, sarcasm, bragging, condescension,
complaining, criticism, blame, pessimism, teasing, insecurity). In reflecting on the conceptual
and functional similarities between different behaviors (i.e., which behaviors might have similar
3 9
elicitors or achieve similar goals), a six-factor structure also seems plausible, with behaviors that
reflect caring about others (help, sympathy), condemnation of others (negative gossip, blame,
criticism), praising others (gratitude, praise, neutral or positive gossip), humility vs. self-
enhancement (bragging, condescension, insecurity, apologizing), general positivity vs. negativity
(optimism, complaining, pessimism), and humor (funny, teasing, and sarcasm).
Major interpersonal traits. A further possibility is that the behaviors will separate into
clusters that are consistent with the major interpersonal traits of extraversion, agreeableness, and
honesty-humility (reviewed in Chapter 1). As I mentioned in Chapter 2, none of the behaviors
seem strongly conceptually-related to extraversion. Helping, sympathy, praise, gratitude, and
apologizing are most conceptually-related to high agreeableness, whereas bragging, teasing,
condescension, blame, sarcasm, criticism, complaining, and negative gossip seem to be most
conceptually-related to low agreeableness. Thus, these 13 behaviors might load onto one factor
(with opposing loadings for the high vs. low agreeableness behaviors), or two factors (one factor
that captures the tendency to actively support others and another that captures the tendency to
restrain oneself from antagonistic behaviors). It is also possible that a narrower cluster of
honesty-humility-related behaviors might emerge, characterized by less bragging, less
condescension, and less sarcasm.
Interpersonal circumplex. Finally, it is possible to derive predictions based on the
described in Chapter 1, the circular ordering of the IPC implies that a given behavior should be
a) strongly positively correlated with behaviors that have a similar circumplex location, b)
uncorrelated with behaviors that are 90º apart, and c) negatively correlated with behaviors that
are 180º apart. Thus, the IPC would imply, for example, that bragging a) should be more
4 0
positively associated with condescension than with blame, b) relatively uncorrelated with
complaining, and c) negatively correlated with gratitude (assuming that my hypothetical
mapping of the IPC locations of the 18 behaviors is correct).
Depending on the strength of the intercorrelations, the number of factors extracted, and
the rotation of the factor solutions, many different factor solutions are plausible. In a two-factor
solution, it should be possible to recover a warmth and dominance factor. In a four-factor
solution, we may see factors that capture behaviors that fall along the aloof–extraverted (NO–
FG), cold–warm (DE–LM), arrogant–unassuming (BC–JK), and dominant–submissive (PA–HI)
axes, respectively (with opposite factor loadings for each opposing octant). However, many
additional factor solutions are plausible because the locations of the behaviors differ as a matter
of degree.
Method and Results
Intercorrelations Among Interpersonal Behaviors
Year 2. A sensitivity power analysis showed that I had 80% power to detect correlations ≥ |.16|
in Year 1, and ≥ |.23| in Year 2. The mean absolute rs show the average extent to which each
interpersonal behavior was correlated with every other behavior. In Year 1, these average |r|s
ranged from .06 (gratitude) to .20 (criticism). The range of the average |r|s was greater in Year 2,
from .07 (apologizing) to .33 (criticism). Interestingly, a paired-samples t-test showed that the
intercorrelations were stronger on average in Year 2 (mean |r| = .21), compared to Year 1 (mean
|r| = .13), 95% CI of mean difference = [.06, .11], p < .001. This could suggest either that the
codings in Year 2 were more valid (despite being less reliable) or that coders were making less
fine-grained distinctions between different behaviors.

Exploratory Factor Analysis
To explore the factor structure of these behaviors and the replicability of this factor
structure across the two years, I used exploratory factor analysis using maximum likelihood and
an orthogonal (varimax) rotation method. The goal of this procedure was to identify clusters of
behaviors that would form meaningful and replicable composites. I used several criteria for
evaluating the optimal number of factors to extract: (a) a visual inspection of the Scree plot, (b)

the MAP test, (c) parallel analysis, (d) the very simple structure criterion, and (f) meaningfulness
(i.e., extracting the number of factors that seemed most interpretable). For the meaningfulness
criterion, I extracted two- to seven-factor solutions for both Year 1 and Year 2 (reported in
across criteria and between the two years, but were generally in the range of 2–4 factors.

Based on behaviors that had substantial factor loadings (≥ .40), these factors appeared to capture
behaviors related to negativity (complaining, pessimism, blame, criticism, and negative gossip),
mockery (being funny, sarcasm, teasing, bragging), supportiveness (sympathy, optimism, and
helping), and gossip (negative gossip and positive/neutral gossip). A three-factor solution
capture antagonistic behaviors (criticism, pessimism, insecurity, teasing, bragging, complaining,
sarcasm, condescension, and blame), positivity (sympathy, optimism, helping, praise, and being
funny), and gossip (negative gossip and neutral or positive gossip). In a four-factor solution, a
further respectfulness factor was interpretable, but the behaviors had weaker factor loadings
(tease = –.47, sarcasm = –.33, gratitude = .39, apologizing = .27).

Comparing the two solutions, the negativity factor in Year 1 is most similar to the
antagonism factor in Year 2, except that sarcasm, teasing, and bragging are factored into a
separate mockery factor (along with being funny) in Year 1. The positivity factor in Year 2 is
most similar to the supportiveness factor in Year 1, except that being funny loads more strongly
onto the mockery factor in Year 1. The gossip factor appears to be similar in both Year 1 and
Year 2.
Confirmatory Factor Analysis
Based on the above explorations, I decided to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis
The four factors comprised negativity (pessimism, insecurity, criticism, complaining,
condescension, and blame), supportiveness (sympathy, optimism, helping, and praise), mockery

(being funny, bragging, sarcasm, and teasing), and gossip (negative gossip and neutral or

Model fit and reliability estimates. The model fit indices and reliability estimates for
conducted on the same datasets, these fit statistics are overestimates and should be interpreted
with caution. In any case, all five indices suggested poor model fit. Across both years, the chi-
square tests rejected the null hypothesis that the model fit the data. Comparative Fit Index and
Tucker-Lewis Index scores were below conventional cutoffs of .90 (Hu & Bentler, 1999), and
the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual

were above conventional cutoffs of .08 (Hu & Bentler, 1999). Below, I explore possible sources
of misfit and whether dropping items (Model 2) improves the fit statistics.

similar across both years, but stronger in Year 2. The biggest discrepancies between the two
years were that insecurity did not load onto the negativity factor in Year 1, and being funny did
not load onto the mockery factor in Year 2. Thus, one possible source of model misfit is that one
item in each year did not load onto the factor specified by the model.

the data in Year 1 that were generated by the same coding protocol as Year 2 and all data from either Year 1 or Year 2.
To examine whether these factor loadings were significantly different across the two
years, I conducted a test of metric (i.e., weak) measurement invariance using multigroup
confirmatory factor analysis. Metric invariance holds if each behavior contributes to the latent
construct to a similar degree across both years (i.e., factor loadings are equal; Meredith, 1993). In
contrast, metric noninvariance would imply that the meaning of the constructs changed between
the two years. I first estimated a model in which all parameters were freely estimated for each
year, and compared the fit of this model with a model in which the factor loadings were
constrained to be equal across both years. The model in which factor loadings were constrained
to be equal across both years (c2[213] = 741.5, p < .001, CFI = .694, TLI = .655, RMSEA =
.108, SRMR = .120) fit significantly worse than the model in which loadings were free to vary
for each year (c2[198] = 601.93, p < .001; CFI = .766, TLI = .716, RMSEA = .098, SRMR =
.088), △c2(15) = 139.57, p < .001. In other words, the factor loadings were significantly different
between the two years.
Exploring sources of discrepancies. Next, I explored two potential sources of the
discrepancies between the factor loadings in Year 1 and Year 2: 1) differences in participants and
2) differences in the coding procedure.
Differences in participants. The Year 1 analyses included a larger set of participants (N
= 287) than the Year 2 analyses (N = 141). To examine whether the discrepancies could be
accounted for by differences in participants, I re-ran the tests of weak measurement invariance
on the subset of participants who had sufficient data in both years (N = 124), separately for each
year. Once again, the model in which factor loadings were constrained to be equal across both
years (c2[213] = 559.92, p < .001; CFI = .669, TLI = .628, RMSEA = .115, SRMR = .155) fit
significantly worse than the model in which loadings were free to vary for each year (c2[198] =
4 8
447.20, p < .001; CFI = .763, TLI = .712, RMSEA = .101, SRMR = .096), △c2(15) = 112.71, p <
.001).
I also used two additional methods to compare the similarity of the vectors of factor
loadings: 1) correlations to compare the rank-ordering of the factor loadings, and 2) the average
absolute difference in the factor loadings. The factor loadings based on all participants in Year 1
were positively correlated with those based on all participants in Year 2, r = .69, 95% CI [.29,
.88], p = .003. However, after restricting the analyses to the same participants in both years, these
vectors of factor loadings were not significantly correlated, r = .36, 95% CI [–.17, .73], p = .173.
The factor loadings based on all vs. the same participants were also positively correlated in Year
1, r = .73, 95% CI [.38, .90], p = .001, as well as in Year 2, r = .98, 95% CI [.93, .99], p < .001.
The average absolute difference in the factor loadings between Year 1 and Year 2 was .19 for all
participants and .23 for the same participants. The average absolute difference in the factor
loadings between all vs. the same participants was .09 in Year 1 and .03 in Year 2.
Overall, these results suggest that the size and rank-order of the factor loadings are more
similar between subsets of participants (all vs. the same) than between the two years. This
suggests that the differences in the pattern of factor loadings between Year 1 and Year 2 are
unlikely to be due to differences in the participants included in each analysis.
Differences in coding procedures. As described in Chapter 2, the Year 1 files were
coded in three phases, each with slightly different coding protocols. Only the last phase used the
same coding protocol as the Year 2 files (elaborated item descriptions with separate surveys for
the positive and negative behaviors). Thus, I re-ran the tests of weak measurement invariance,
but only included Year 1 data that were generated using the same coding protocol as the Year 2
files. Note that this only included files that were recorded outside of the four ESM-matched
4 9
hours (except for one participant). After applying the same inclusion criteria of a minimum of 20
speech-containing files, this Year 1 subset comprised 282 participants.
constant, insecurity loaded onto the negativity factor (though to a lower degree than in Year 2,
descriptively), and being funny loaded to a lower degree onto the mockery factor (though still to
a higher degree than in Year 2, descriptively).
Next, I re-ran the tests of metric measurement invariance on a model fit to the data
generated from the same coding procedure in Year 1, comparing this with a model fit to all data
in Year 2. The model in which factor loadings were constrained to be equal across both years
(c2[213] = 787.694, p < .001, CFI = .675, TLI = .634, RMSEA = .113, SRMR = .124) still fit
significantly worse than the model in which loadings were free to vary for each year (c2[198] =
614.681, p < .001, CFI = .765, TLI = .715, RMSEA = .10, SRMR = .088), △c2(15) = 173.01, p
< .001. Thus, even when the coding protocol was identical, the factor loadings were still
significantly different between the two years.
As above, I used correlations and average absolute differences to further compare the
similarity of the vectors of factor loadings. The factor loadings based on the final coding protocol
in Year 1 were positively correlated with those based on all data in Year 1, r = .67, 95% CI [.26,
.87], p = .005, as well as Year 2, r = .75, 95% CI [.40, .91], p < .001. The average absolute
difference in the factor loadings based on the final coding protocol in Year 1 and the factor
loadings based on all data was .15 for Year 1 and .16 for Year 2. In other words, holding the
coding protocol constant results in factor loadings that are about halfway between the solutions
from Year 1 (all data) and Year 2.
5 0
Overall, these results suggest that the overall discrepancies in the factor loadings between
Year 1 and Year 2 can be partially (but not completely) explained by differences in the coding
protocol. This is likely because coding for 9 (instead of all 18) behaviors at a time made the task
easier for the coders, with a likely ensuing improvement in data quality. Nevertheless, because
the data from the earlier coding protocol likely still have some signal (even if the data are
noisier), I will include all data in the final analyses.
Removing non-invariant items. Finally, I fit an alternative model (Model 2) in which I
dropped two items: insecurity (which did not load onto the negativity factor in Year 1) and being
funny (which did not load onto the mockery factor in Year 2). Fit statistics and reliability
absolute difference in the factor loadings between Year 1 and Year 2 was .11, which was
descriptively lower than for Model 1 (.19). These vectors of factor loadings were also
descriptively more strongly correlated than in Model 1, r = .90, 95% CI [.71, .97], p < .001. The
fit statistics were still poor overall, but generally reflected better fit compared to Model 1, at least
for the Year 2 data. The reliability estimates were similar for the negativity, supportiveness, and
gossip factors, but somewhat different for mockery (slightly lower in Year 1 and substantially
higher in Year 2).
I re-ran the tests of metric measurement invariance after dropping these items. The model
in which factor loadings were constrained to be equal across both years (c2[157] = 495.45, p <
.001; CFI = .762, TLI = .724, RMSEA = .100, SRMR = .103) still fit significantly worse than the
model in which loadings were free to vary for each year (c2[144] = 435.05, p < .001; CFI = .795,
TLI = .741, RMSEA = .097, SRMR = .083), △c2(13) = 60.41, p < .001. Thus, even after
dropping the two noninvariant items, the factor loadings were still significantly different between
5 1
the two years, but the between-year discrepancies in the fit statistics were less dramatic than for
Model 1. Thus, for the subsequent rank-order and between-person correlate analyses (Chapters 4
and 5) involving these factors, I will use the solution from Model 2.
four factors in Model 1 and Model 2. The intercorrelations were almost identical between Model
1 and Model 2, so I focus here on discussing the differences in effect sizes between the two
years, for Model 2. The negativity and mockery factors were positively associated in both years,
but the strength of these correlations suggest that negativity and mockery captured distinct
constructs in Year 1 (r = .39), but perhaps not in Year 2 (r = .92). The negativity and gossip
factors were also positively associated in both years, but to a much larger extent in Year 1 (r =
.67) than in Year 2 (.34). Finally, there were some weaker and less consistent positive
associations between mockery and gossip (Year 1 only; r = .16) and between supportiveness and
gossip (Year 2 only; r = .20). All in all, despite the discrepancies in model fit between Year 1
and Year 2, the detectable pattern of intercorrelations among the factors was quite consistent.

Discussion
Personality psychology has a long tradition of discovering the factor structure of self-
reported personality traits (e.g., Ashton et al., 2004; De Raad, Perugini, Hrebickova, & Szarota,
5 2
1998; Saucier & Goldberg, 2001). However, relatively few studies have attempted to uncover
factor structures based on behavioral observations (cf. Kulkarni et al., 2018; Leising & Bleidorn,
2011). In this chapter, I examined the factor structure of 18 interpersonal behaviors using a
combination of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The best-fitting factor solution
involved four factors: negativity (pessimism, criticism, complaining, condescension, and blame),
supportiveness (sympathy, optimism, helping, and praise), mockery (bragging, sarcasm, and
teasing), and gossip (negative and neutral or positive). Four behaviors (insecurity, being funny,
gratitude, and apologizing) did not seem to fit within this four-factor structure. Here, I discuss
the results with respect to the two purposes of this chapter: 1) to derive reliable behavioral
composites for use in subsequent analyses, and 2) to generate hypotheses about the common
interpersonal meanings of specific behaviors. I also consider the implications of these results for
the next two empirical chapters.
The primary goal of this chapter was to derive reliable behavioral composites in order to
supplement the analyses of the rank-order stability and correlates of individual behaviors with
analyses of behavioral composites. To the extent that reliable behavioral composites can be
identified, the effect sizes for analyses involving composites should be stronger than those
involving individual behaviors. The negativity, supportiveness, and mockery composites showed
reasonable levels of reliability in Year 1 (ωs > .60), and higher levels of reliability in Year 2 (ωs
> .73). However, the gossip factor was slightly less reliable (ωs ~ .50), probably because there
were only two indicators. Still, this shows that multiple behaviors can, with adequate levels of
reliability, differentiate participants’ general behavioral tendencies towards negativity,
supportiveness, mockery, and gossip. This provides a reasonable basis for examining the rank-
5 3
order stability and correlates of behavioral composites in Chapters 4 and 5, in which I will return
to the issue of whether effect sizes are stronger for composites than for individual behaviors.
The second goal of this chapter was to generate hypotheses about the shared interpersonal
meanings that underlie different behaviors. I considered the possibility that the behaviors would
split into 1) a positive and negative cluster, 2) an intuitive six-factor structure (caring, other-
condemning, other-praising, humility vs. self-enhancement, general positivity vs. negativity, and
humor), or 3) clusters based on IPC locations. The resulting four-factor structure was somewhat
different from each of these possibilities.
combination of warmth and moderate–high dominance. These behaviors seem to be unified by a
common function of supporting and encouraging others, and making others feel good. They also
seem to be most conceptually-related to high levels of Big Five agreeableness. The behaviors in
the negativity factor reflected low warmth across the full range of dominance, and seem to
capture a blend of condemning others (condescension, blame, criticism) as well as general
negativity (complaining and pessimism). These behaviors seem to be reflective of low Big Five
and HEXACO conceptualizations of agreeableness.
Notably, the supportiveness and negativity factors were relatively uncorrelated, which is
consistent with the perspective that prosocial and antisocial traits are separable (Krueger, Hicks,
& Mcgue, 2001). The behaviors in the mockery factor tended to reflect a combination of low
warmth and moderate–high dominance, and perhaps have the common consequence of making
other people feel worse about themselves in the service of self-enhancement and humor. This
mockery factor may also reflect low Big Five agreeableness, but seems more specifically related
to low honesty-humility. Finally, gossip captured the general tendency to talk about others,
5 4
regardless of the warmth of these acts. Gossip is not conceptually central to extraversion,
agreeableness, or honesty-humility.

To the extent that these behaviors do capture common interpersonal meanings, it raises
the possibility that personality traits might have similar associations with behaviors in the same
factor. For example, trait agreeableness may be associated with each of the behaviors in the
supportiveness cluster. Similarly, to the extent that behaviors in the same cluster have similar
interpersonal impacts (e.g., making others feel supported vs. derogated), they may also have
similar interpersonal consequences. For example, it is possible that bragging, teasing, and
sarcasm would each be related to being disliked. These results therefore generate some general
5 5
hypotheses about how traits may be related to clusters of behaviors, and how clusters of
behaviors may be related to interpersonal outcomes (the focus of Chapter 5).
Far from being definitive, this factor structure should be considered highly tentative for
several reasons. First, the 18 behaviors do not represent a comprehensive sampling of the
interpersonal space (i.e., agreeableness-related behaviors are overrepresented and extraversion-
and honesty-humility-related behaviors are underrepresented). Thus, this factor structure should
not be interpreted as the true structure of interpersonal traits in general. Second, I approached
these analyses in an exploratory way. The resulting factor structure would need to be confirmed
in future replication studies.
Moreover, the fit statistics for the best-fitting CFA solution were still poor by
conventional standards (Hu & Bentler, 1999). One source of poor model fit is the low
reliabilities of the indicators, stemming from inter-coder disagreement on which participants
expressed higher or lower frequencies of each behavior. Because each behavioral indicator
contains noise due to measurement error, this attenuates the loadings of each behavior onto its
respective factor. A second source of poor model fit could be that the factor structure seemed to
change between Year 1 and Year 2. Thus, it was difficult to find a factor solution that would fit
the data well in both years. The discrepancies in factor loadings between the two years could not
be accounted for by differences in the subset of participants who were included in the Year 1 and
Year 2 analyses. These discrepancies did seem to be partially accounted for by differences in the
coding procedure (i.e., coding all 18 behaviors vs. only 9 at a time), but this did not completely
explain the discrepancies. This raises the alarming possibility that coders who coded the Year 1
files (153 coders) had different concepts of these behaviors, compared to coders who coded the
Year 2 files (68 coders, including 63 who had coded the files in Year 1).

Chapter 4: Rank-Order Stability Across One Year
Do people show stable individual differences in what they do to each other, or are they
wildly inconsistent in how they act? In this chapter, I address one of the most central issues in
personality psychology—behavioral consistency—by examining the year-to-year rank-order
stability of the 18 individual behaviors as well the four factors uncovered in Chapter 3. The first,
narrower purpose of this chapter is to better understand the psychometric properties of EAR-
coded interpersonal behaviors; specifically, the extent to which they capture individual
differences that are stable across time. The second, broader purpose is to consider the
implications for the person–situation debate.
Defining Behavioral Consistency
Demonstrating behavioral consistency has been key to refuting situationist critiques and
providing support for the existence of personality. It would not make much sense, for example,
to say that “Mary is boastful” if she showed no consistency whatsoever in the extent to which
she bragged across different situations and over time, compared to other people. However,
behavioral consistency does not imply that personality is “set like plaster” (James, 1890; i.e.,
does not change over time). Mean-level change (e.g., people tend to become more agreeable
across the lifespan) is consistent with rank-order stability (e.g., people who are more agreeable
than others at age 18 tend to be more agreeable than others at age 40; Roberts, Wood, & Caspi,
2008).
Nor does behavioral consistency imply that people behave in the same way in every
situation. People do act differently to adapt to situational demands (e.g., people talk more when
interacting with a submissive partner than a dominant partner; Leikas et al., 2012), but
demonstrate rank-order stability across situations (e.g., people who talk more than others when
5 7
interacting with a submissive partner still tend to talk more than others when interacting with a
dominant partner; Leikas et al., 2012). Moreover, although single behavioral acts observed at one
time point only weakly predict single behavioral acts at a subsequent time point (Fleeson &
Gallagher, 2009), when many behavioral instances are averaged together across an extended
period of time (e.g., one week), these behavioral aggregates should strongly predict behavioral
aggregates at a later time point (Fleeson & Gallagher, 2009). This is the type of behavioral
consistency that I focus on in this chapter.
High rank-order stability across one year would mean that people who expressed a given
behavior (e.g., sympathy) more frequently across one week (compared to other people) were also
more likely to express those behaviors more frequently across another week, one year later. A
rank-order stability correlation of 0 would mean that a person’s relative standing on a given
behavior across one week provides no information on their relative standing on that behavior one
year later. Analyses of rank-order stability thus provide a strong test of the extent to which
observed between-person differences in interpersonal behaviors reflect stable individual
differences (vs. situational factors and measurement error).
Psychometric Properties of EAR-Coded Interpersonal Behaviors
As mentioned in Chapter 2, behavioral codings based on the EAR are not necessarily
“objective”. Whereas some micro-level behaviors can be coded in a fairly objective way (e.g.,
whether or not a participant talked or laughed), macro-level social behaviors (e.g., whether a
participant bragged or expressed condescension) require a greater amount of inference. Thus,
observed between-person variability in EAR-coded interpersonal behaviors will capture a blend
of true individual differences, measurement error due to inter-coder disagreement, and other
5 8
behaviors at each year. Rank-order stability provides a complementary metric of test-retest
reliability.
To the extent that EAR-coded interpersonal behaviors are stable from one year to the
next, I can be more confident that these codings reflect meaningful individual differences (vs.
measurement error). This will provide additional context for interpreting the correlational
analyses in Chapter 5. For example, null effects will be more informative to the extent that the
behavioral codings adequately captured true individual differences in the first place.
As mentioned in Chapter 1, Bollich and colleagues (2016) showed that individual
differences in interpersonal behaviors were moderately stable (mean r = .47 over 4 weeks, mean
r = .52 over 10 weeks). Across 10 weeks, the most stable individual differences were in
apologizing, helping, and complaining (rs > .78), followed by affection (not measured in the
present dissertation), optimism, sympathy, condescension, and pessimism (rs between .47 to
.58), and praise, blame, and sarcasm (rs between .25 to .34). Individual differences in gratitude
and bragging had stability correlations close to 0. Because of the small sample size (N = 73),
Bollich and colleagues’ estimates were quite imprecise. However, because rank-order stability
decreases as the retest interval increases (Roberts & DelVecchio, 2000), these estimates provide
a sense of the upper bound on the stability correlations that might be observed across one year.
Here, I build on Bollich and colleagues (2016) in three ways, by testing rank-order
stability 1) using a relatively larger sample (N = 124, compared to N = 11 and N = 73 in Bollich
et al., 2016), 2) including additional interpersonal behaviors beyond those examined in Bollich
and colleagues (being funny, negative gossip, neutral or positive gossip, teasing, and expressions
of insecurity/self-doubt), and 3) across a much longer retest period—one year. More generally, to
my knowledge, no other studies have examined the rank-order stability of EAR-coded everyday
5 9
behaviors across such a long retest period. Thus, the results of this chapter will provide future
EAR researchers with useful information about the psychometric properties of EAR-coded
interpersonal behaviors.
Implications for the Person–Situation Debate
More broadly, temporal stability analyses can shed light on deeper questions about the
relative impact of persons and situations on different behaviors. If people act in a completely
different way from one year to the next (assuming that the behaviors are reliably measured), this
would suggest that situations have a greater influence on interpersonal behavior than do stable
traits. If high levels of temporal stability exist, there are two possible explanations. The person
explanation is that personality exerts a strong influence on interpersonal behavior. The
situationist explanation would be that situations are still driving behavior, and people behave in
similar ways over time because they end up in similar situations. In other words, temporal
stability is a necessary but insufficient condition for demonstrating the influence of personality
on behavior. Although the current analyses cannot distinguish between these two possibilities,
rank-order stability analyses can at least reveal the extent to which a person’s future
interpersonal behavior can be predicted by how they treated others in the past.
Method and Results
For the four factors discovered in Chapter 3, I report latent correlations based on the
the rank-order stability of the individual behaviors at a latent level. However, due to the very low
inter-rater reliability for several of the behaviors, many of the models did not converge, and the
6 0
models that did gave implausibly high estimates (e.g., r > .80). Thus, below, I only report zero-
order correlations based on observed composites for the individual behaviors.

To estimate the rank-order stability of the factors at a latent level, I specified a model in
which each behavior was an indicator of the latent construct measured at Year 1 or Year 2 (see
years, to ensure that the meaning of the latent factor would be equivalent across both years. The
(Rosseel, 2012), with maximum likelihood estimation. I also planned to estimate latent models
produced implausibly high estimates (probably due to the very low reliability of some of the
indicators in Year 2). Thus, I only report the zero-order correlations for the rank-order stability
of the individual behaviors.
Measurement Invariance for Each Factor
Prior to estimating the rank-order stability of the factors, I tested whether metric
measurement invariance held for each factor. Although metric measurement invariance did not
hold for the full model (as described in Chapter 3), for the purposes of assessing the rank-order
stability of each factor, all that is required is that invariance holds for each factor of interest.
Thus, I compared the fit of a multi-group CFA model in which all loadings were free to vary
between the two years with the fit of a model in which the loadings for a given factor (e.g.,
negativity) were constrained to equality across both years. These analyses only included the
subset of 124 participants who had sufficient data in both years and were therefore included in
negativity, supportiveness, and mockery, the other indices generally reflected only modest
worsening of fit when loadings for a given factor were constrained to equality across both years.
Thus, we can be reasonably confident that the items for each factor are contributing to the
6 2
measurement of a given construct in a similar way across both years, providing a basis for
interpreting the rank-order stability correlations.

Rank-Order Stability Estimates
Overall, out of 18 behaviors, 15 point estimates were positive, and 7 were statistically
sarcasm, teasing, and neutral or positive gossip were between .26–.28, whereas the point
estimates for negative gossip, apologizing, and condescension were slightly lower at .18–.21.
The point estimates for criticism, complaining, insecurity, and gratitude were in the .16–.17
range, with 95% confidence intervals that just captured zero. In order to have 80% power to
detect correlations in the .16–.17 range, I would have needed 303 participants. Thus, these four
null effects could be due to low power. Finally, the point estimates for the rank-order stability of
6 3
the remaining behaviors were all ≤ .12 (optimism, praising, bragging, being funny) or even
negative (pessimism, sympathy, and blame).

factors were individual behaviors (averaged across coders).
Turning to the behavioral composites, the mockery and gossip composites showed some
behavioral stability (rs > .28) from one year to the next, suggesting that they captured reliable
and broader individual differences. These composites showed descriptively greater stability than
the average stability of the individual behaviors (.28 vs. .22 for mockery; .26 vs. .23 for
gossip)—but not by that much. Moreover, there was no evidence of stability in the negativity and
6 4
supportiveness factors (rs .08–.09), and these composites showed very similar levels of stability
compared to the average stability of the individual behaviors (.09 vs. .08 for negativity, .08 vs.
.08 for supportiveness). Finally, the latent correlation was somewhat higher than the observed
correlation for mockery, but not for any of the other composites. Thus, overall, these results were
somewhat inconsistent with the psychometric principle that composites should be more reliable
than individual behaviors. This may suggest that the factors lack validity.
Discussion
In summary, these results revealed a mixed picture of the rank-order stability of EAR-
coded interpersonal behaviors. As would be expected from a longer retest period, the average
level of rank-order stability in this study (.13) was much lower than Bollich and colleagues’
(2016) estimate of an average r of .52 across 10 weeks. In the best case, stability estimates were
in the .26–.28 range (helping, sarcasm, teasing, and neutral or positive gossip); in the worst case,
stability estimates were close to zero or negative (pessimism, blame, sympathy, and praise).
Here, I discuss the implications of these relatively modest levels of rank-order stability for
interpreting the substantive analyses in Chapter 5, and for the person–situation debate.
There are several possible reasons for these relatively modest levels of rank-order
stability. Methodologically, the low levels of rank-order stability likely reflect the low reliability
with which the behaviors were coded (especially in Year 2). Low inter-coder reliability means
that coders were only able to approximately distinguish between people who expressed higher or
lower levels of a given behavior in a given year. Indeed, the correlation between the average
inter-coder reliability (across both years) and the rank-order stability correlations was .41, 95%
CI [–.07, .74], p = .088 (N = 18 behaviors). Second, given that the factor structure of the
interpersonal behaviors was somewhat inconsistent between the two years (see Chapter 3), rank-
6 5
order stability may have been low because the coders in Year 1 interpreted each behavior in a
different way than the coders in Year 2. A third possibility is that some behaviors are truly more
determined by the situation than by the person. Thus, rank-order changes in interpersonal
behaviors might reflect changing situational demands from one year to the next.
For different reasons, the first and third possibilities—poor measurement reliability and
the predominance of situational influences on interpersonal behavior—would both imply that it
may be more difficult to detect correlates of the negativity and supportiveness composites, and
the individual behaviors of pessimism, blame, sympathy, optimism, praise, bragging, and being
funny (see Chapter 5). The measurement explanation is that if the observed variation in
interpersonal behaviors mostly reflects noise, it would be difficult to establish behavioral
manifestations of personality traits. The situationist explanation is that if the behaviors were
determined more by the situation than by the person, then personality traits should not be
substantively important in predicting these behaviors. On the other hand, the mockery and gossip
composites and the individual behaviors of helping, sarcasm, teasing, and neutral or positive
gossip show moderate amounts of stability over time. Thus, it should be easier to detect
correlates of these behaviors (assuming that the observed behavioral consistency is not simply
due to being in similar situations; see below), and null effects should be more interpretable (i.e.,
unlikely to be primarily due to poor measurement).
Although there were moderate amounts of temporal stability in some of the behaviors,
these findings do not directly refute situationist critiques of personality. A situationist would
argue that temporal stability in behavior can be explained by being in similar situations from one
year to the next. However, the stability of situations could of course be driven by personality
traits (i.e., situation selection effects). In any case, a stronger test of behavioral consistency
6 6
would require the simultaneous assessment of situations and behavior over time. This would also
address the question of the extent to which low rank-order stability is due to the influence of
situational variability, rather than measurement error.
In summary, although low measurement reliability, modest statistical power, and the lack
of situational measurement limits the interpretability of these rank-order stability estimates, these
results suggest that individual differences in several everyday interpersonal behaviors (helping,
sarcasm, teasing, neutral or positive gossip, negative gossip, apologizing, and condescension) are
at least somewhat stable across one year. These findings complement studies that have
demonstrated cross-situational consistency in interpersonal behavior in the lab (e.g., Leikas et al.,
2012; Leising & Bleidorn, 2011) by showing that individual differences in interpersonal
behavior also show some stability across time even in far less controlled settings (i.e., across
everyday situations in the real world). This suggests that at least some EAR-coded interpersonal
behaviors reflect meaningful individual differences—an issue I will continue to explore in
Chapter 5, where I examine the correlates of these interpersonal behaviors.

Chapter 5: Correlates and Consequences of Everyday Interpersonal Behavior
So far in this dissertation, I have explored the psychometric properties of the set of 18
interpersonal behaviors. Now that we have learned something about the extent to which these
behaviors reflect reliable individual differences and the possible psychological meanings of
different interpersonal behaviors, it is time to connect them with personality traits and informant-
reported social consequences. First, I explore the personality and gender correlates of each
interpersonal behavior. For example, do agreeable people express sympathy more often? Do
women apologize more than men? Next, I examine whether these interpersonal behaviors have
implications for being liked and having good relationships with one’s friends. For example, are
thankful people liked more than the ungrateful? Below, I describe the specific goals of each of
these research questions.
Potential Theoretical Contributions of Correlating Traits with Behaviors
The primary purpose of correlating traits with behaviors was to clarify the interpersonal
behavioral implications of personality traits. The second purpose was to further clarify the
psychological meaning of everyday interpersonal behaviors, and especially whether they reflect
moral character (as assumed by Bollich et al., 2016). In other words, examining the correlations
between personality traits and interpersonal behaviors provides the opportunity for both types of
measures to validate each other (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955). Below, I describe these two
purposes in greater detail and introduce the trait correlates of interest.
Clarifying the behavioral implications of personality trait measures. In Chapter 1, I
argued that behavior is the ultimate outcome of interest and that behavior is central to the
examined how interpersonal traits manifest in actual interpersonal behavior in everyday life (for
6 8
a review, see Chapter 2). Here, I will use the example of agreeableness to illustrate how
measuring actual behavior can shed light on the construct validity of personality measures,
address theoretical debates about the link between personality traits and behavior, and potentially
reveal unexpected behavioral consequences of various constructs.
Measuring actual behavior can help establish the construct validity of personality trait
measures and clarify whether traits are manifested in behavior in a decontextualized manner
(e.g., McAdams & Pals, 2006). For example, if acting in prosocial ways and restraining oneself
measures should be positively correlated with sympathetic and considerate behaviors such as
sympathy, help, and gratitude, and negatively correlated with antagonistic behaviors such as
criticism, blame, and condescension. To the extent that self-report measures of agreeableness are
correlated with such behaviors, we can be more confident in the validity of these measures as
capturing behavior-relevant traits. If traits are strongly correlated with behavior without
considering contextual factors, this might also support conceptualizations of traits as being
unconditional and decontextualized (McAdams & Pals, 2006). Such associations can also help us
attach more concrete behavioral meanings to statements such as, “Michelle is highly agreeable”
or “Simine is extremely introverted” (an issue that I explore further in Chapter 6).
If, however, self-reports of agreeableness are only weakly or even uncorrelated with
conceptually-relevant behaviors, one possibility is that self-report measures only capture a
person’s self-perceptions (i.e., identity) rather than what that person is actually like (i.e., their
trait; McAbee & Connelly, 2016). Alternatively, it might imply that the construct of
agreeableness should be conceptualized as capturing sympathetic affect and trusting cognitions,
without any behavioral implications. This seems like a dissatisfying solution because a construct
6 9
that is “all in the head” would be far less interesting and important than one that has behavioral
implications. A further possibility is that agreeableness only manifests behaviorally in the
presence of relevant stimuli, rather than in general. This would support conceptualizations of
personality traits as being context-dependent (e.g., Allport, 1937; Tellegen, 1981; DeYoung,
2015), and would suggest that existing definitions of agreeableness should be revised to specify
the relevant conditions under which agreeable thoughts and feelings are manifested as behavior.
Measuring actual behavior can also shed light on the process by which people judge their
own traits, and, ultimately, whether they know themselves (Vazire & Carlson, 2011). In other
words, can we find behavioral evidence for a person’s claim that they are agreeable, at least
among this set of 18 interpersonal behaviors? Self-perception theory posits that people observe
their behavior and infer that they must have the kind of traits that those behaviors imply (Bem,
1972). If self-reports of agreeableness (for example) are correlated with behaviors such as
sympathy and helping, this might imply that people consider how often they enact such
behaviors when they judge their agreeableness. If, however, none of these behaviors are
correlated with self-reports of agreeableness, this might suggest that people rely more heavily on
other information sources (e.g., values, self-concepts, self-enhancement) or on motivated
interpretations of their behaviors than on straightforward recollections of their actual behavior
when judging their agreeableness (Robins & John, 1997). Each of these factors would reduce the
amount of self-insight that people have into their agreeableness.
All of the above examples consider the implications of finding or failing to find
behavioral correlates that are closely matched with existing conceptualizations of constructs. A
further opportunity of exploring correlations between a variety of traits and behaviors—
including those that seem less obviously theoretically matched—is that we may learn something
7 0
new or unexpected about different traits. For example, by exploring the associations between
personality traits and the words that people used in their Facebook posts, Park and colleagues
(2015) found some theoretically-obvious correlations (e.g., extraverts used more party-related
words), but also others that were less obvious (e.g., introverts talked more about fixing
computers). Similarly, in a study of the connections between everyday speech and momentary
emotions, unsurprisingly, people reported feeling less happy in moments when they talked more
about math and classes and tests, but less intuitively, they also reported feeling happier when
they talked more about clothing (Sun et al., 2020). For this reason, in this chapter, I chose to
include several trait correlates, including some that seemed less obviously relevant to
interpersonal behavior (described below).
Clarifying the psychological meaning of everyday interpersonal behaviors. The
psychological meaning of a specific behavior cannot be simply assumed; however, examining
the personality correlates of behaviors can help clarify their psychological meaning. For
example, dictator game allocations are often interpreted as being indicative of altruism
(Carpenter, Connolly, & Myers, 2008), but previous work on the discriminant validity of the
compassion and politeness aspects of agreeableness suggests that generous dictator game
allocations reflect adherence to social norms regarding fairness (i.e., good manners), rather than
emotional concern (Zhao, Ferguson, & Smillie, 2017).
In Chapter 3, I began to explore the common interpersonal meanings that might underlie
specific behavioral manifestations. The results of Chapter 3 revealed four factors, which I
interpreted as capturing common tendencies towards negativity (condescension, blame, criticism,
complaining, pessimism), supportiveness (helping, sympathy, praise, and optimism), mockery
(bragging, teasing, and sarcasm), and gossip (negative and positive or neutral). Correlating these
7 1
behavioral composites with traits can further help clarify their interpersonal meanings. For
example, to the extent that the supportiveness-related behaviors are correlated with trait
agreeableness, this would suggest that these behaviors are motivated by common prosocial
tendencies. If mockery-related behaviors are more strongly related to disagreeableness than to
extraversion, this would suggest that such behaviors typically have a more antagonistic (rather
than dominant and playful) meaning. More generally, if traits are more strongly correlated with
behavioral composites than with individual behaviors, this would further demonstrate the validity
and utility of the composites discovered in Chapter 3.
Uncovering trait correlates can also help to clarify the meaning of individual behaviors.
For example, if agreeable (rather than disagreeable) people are more likely to spread negative
gossip in everyday life, this would suggest that negative gossip is typically motivated by
prosocial rather than spiteful motives (Feinberg, Willer, Stellar, & Keltner, 2012). Furthermore,
although some forms of gratitude expressions (e.g., writing thank you cards) might be valid
indicators of agreeableness, everyday expressions of gratitude (e.g., thanking a cashier) might be
relatively trivial and reflect social norms and situational expectations rather than prosocial traits.
A further goal is to test the assumption that the interpersonal behaviors assessed by
Bollich and colleagues (2016) are, in fact, indicative of moral character. As mentioned in
Chapter 2, Bollich and colleagues aimed to capture prototypically virtuous behaviors and
concluded that “there are substantially stable individual differences in these moral behaviors” (p.
19). The interpretation of these behaviors as being “moral” has important implications for
longstanding debates about whether individual differences in morality exist (Doris, 2002;
Fleeson, Furr, Jayawickreme, Meindl, & Helzer, 2014; McAdams, 2009), or whether moral
behavior can be better explained by “seemingly unimportant or irrelevant situational features”
7 2
(Ellemers, van der Toorn, Paunov, & van Leeuwen, 2019, p. 26). However, this interpretation
rests on the untested assumption that the measured behaviors are actually reflective of moral
character.
Here, I test this assumption by correlating several of Bollich and colleagues’ (2016)
“moral behaviors” with self- and informant-reports of trait morality. If Bollich and colleagues’
interpretation is correct, then gratitude, praise, sympathy, helping, apologizing, and optimism
should be positively associated with trait morality, whereas sarcasm, bragging, condescension,
complaining, criticism, blame, and pessimism should be negatively associated with trait
morality. This rests on the assumption that these self- and informant-report measures are valid
criteria for trait morality, an issue I will turn to in the discussion.
Personality trait correlates of interest. I examined several personality trait correlates
that were either highly interpersonally relevant or seemed conceptually relevant to one or more
of the other behaviors of interest in this study. Although I approached this project in an
exploratory manner, it is possible to map the interpersonal traits onto the IPC (as reviewed in
Chapter 2). This provides a basis for identifying expected links between interpersonal traits and
behaviors according to the circular ordering of the IPC (described in Chapter 2). In addition,
empirical literature, including indirect measures of the target behaviors (e.g., self-report
measures of gratitude, inferences of sarcasm’s correlates based on self-reports of aggressive
humor styles).

Interpersonal traits. I included measures of extraversion and agreeableness, the two
domains within the Big Five taxonomy that are most strongly related to interpersonal behavior
(as reviewed in Chapter 1). In addition, honesty-humility is another major interpersonal trait
7 4
captured by the HEXACO taxonomy. This dataset did not contain a measure of honesty-
humility. However, as I describe below, narcissism is a highly interpersonal trait that falls within
the honesty-humility domain (Lee & Ashton, 2005). Thus, with the inclusion of narcissism, the
three major interpersonal domains captured by the Big Five and HEXACO models are
represented in these analyses.
Narcissism is conceptualized by a grandiose view of oneself, beliefs about personal
superiority, and a sense of entitlement (Grapsas, Brummelman, Back, & Denissen, 2020). A
recent process model proposes that narcissists are driven by a dominant status motive, and
engage in self-promotion or other-derogation in order to pursue status (Grapsas et al., 2020).
Narcissism thus tends to be aligned near the dominance axis (i.e., 90º) in IPC space (Buss &
Chiodo, 1991; Gurtman, 1992; Bradlee & Emmons, 1992; Ruiz, Smith, & Rhodewalt, 2001).
Given that narcissists tend to make positive first impressions (Back, Schmukle, & Egloff, 2010)
that decline over time (Leckelt, Kkufner, Nestler, & Back, 2015; Paulhus, 1998), laboratory-
based observations are insufficient for understanding the interpersonal behaviors of narcissists.
Instead, naturalistic behavioral observation is especially essential for understanding the
behavioral portrait of a narcissist. A small previous EAR study (N = 79) found that narcissists
tended to argue more and act in more extraverted ways (e.g., being in a group and socializing;
Holtzman et al., 2010). Other EAR studies have examined associations between narcissism and
language use (e.g., the use of “I” pronouns; Carey et al., 2015; Holtzman et al., 2019). In this
dissertation, I build on this work by examining the self-promoting (e.g., bragging), other-
derogating (e.g., teasing, condescension), and combative (e.g., criticism, blame) behaviors that
seem more conceptually relevant to narcissism.
7 5
Additional traits. As mentioned above, one of the goals of this chapter was to explore
correlations between a variety of traits and behaviors in order to potentially generate new
hypotheses about the interpersonal implications of traits that seem less obviously relevant to
interpersonal behavior. I therefore included the remaining Big Five traits of conscientiousness,
neuroticism, and openness. Conscientiousness describes tendencies towards productiveness,
orderliness, and responsibility. Neuroticism describes the tendency to experience negative
emotions such as anxiety, depression, and anger. Finally, openness describes tendencies towards
intellectual curiosity, creativity, imagination, and aesthetic appreciation. Thus, at first
appearance, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness seem less obviously relevant to
interpersonal phenomena compared to extraversion and agreeableness. McCrae and Costa (1989)
did note that these traits are in one sense interpersonal because they all influence how people
interact (e.g., avoiding those who are depressed, seeking out those with similar intellectual and
aesthetic values, and judging friends on the basis of their reliability). Nevertheless, they argued
that conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness are not intrinsically interpersonal in that one
can accomplish a task, feel unhappy, or respond to art with or without other people.
Others have argued that conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness contain agentic
and communal qualities and can thus be described within IPC space. Such efforts have placed
neuroticism in the cold–submissive octant (Ansell & Pincus, 2004; Schmidt, Wagner, & Kiesler,
1999), openness in either the warm (Schmidt et al., 1999) or warm–dominant octant (Ansell &
Pincus, 2004), and conscientiousness as either warm (Schmidt et al., 1999) or dominant (Ansell
& Pincus, 2004). Conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness have also been linked to various
social outcomes and interpersonal behaviors (for reviews, see Harris & Vazire, 2016; Ozer &
Benet-Martínez, 2006; Roberts, Kuncel, Shiner, Caspi, & Goldberg, 2007). For example,
7 6
conscientious people tend to be more satisfied with their family and romantic relationships (Ozer
& Benet-Martínez, 2006), are less likely to get divorced (Roberts et al., 2007), and less
frequently swear (Mehl et al., 2006). Neuroticism is correlated with a range of negative
relationship outcomes, including dissatisfaction with one’s family and romantic relationships,
greater conflict and abuse (Ozer & Benet-Martinez, 2006), and a greater likelihood of divorce
(Roberts et al., 2007). Neurotic people are also more likely to argue and less likely to socialize
(Mehl et al., 2006). Finally, spouses tend to have similar openness scores (Botwin, Buss, &
Shackelford, 1997; McCrae, 1996), and open people tend to delay childbirth and have fewer
children (Jokela, Alvergne, Pollet, & Lummaa, 2011; van Scheppingen et al., 2016). Thus, it
seems worthwhile to further explore the everyday interpersonal implications of
conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness.
I also included measures of self-esteem, satisfaction with life, religiosity, and being
funny. I was interested in exploring whether self-esteem would have different interpersonal
correlates compared to narcissism, given that both constructs reflect positive self-views but have
opposing interpersonal implications (Campbell, Rudich, & Sedikides, 2002). I was also curious
about whether satisfaction with life would have behavioral manifestations that reflected
positivity (e.g., optimism) or negativity (e.g., complaining, pessimism). I included religiosity
because religions seek to encourage prosocial behavior, but behavioral evidence tends to paint a
more complex picture of the link between religion and prosocial behavior (Tsang, Rowatt, &
Shariff, 2015). Other than these goals, these variables were included to explore the interpersonal
implications of traits that fit less neatly within the Big Five model.
Exploring Gender Differences in Everyday Interpersonal Behavior
7 7
Beyond personality traits, I explored gender differences in interpersonal behaviors.
Although there are many stereotypes about psychological gender differences, the gender-
similarities hypothesis proposes that men and women are similar on most, but not all,
psychological variables (Hyde, 2014). In general, women tend to self-report substantially higher
levels of warmth, as shown by gender differences around d = 0.45 on traits such as compassion
(Weisberg, DeYoung, & Hirsh, 2011). Men tend to self-report higher levels of agentic traits such
as assertiveness, but these gender differences tend to be smaller (e.g., d = 0.09 in Weisberg et al.,
2011). Using an event-sampling method to sample self-reported dominant, submissive,
agreeable, and quarrelsome behaviors, Moskowitz, Suh, and Desaulniers (1994) found that
women were more communal (especially with other women), but found no evidence that women
and men differed in agentic behaviors. Gurtman and Lee (2009) found that the largest gender
differences in interpersonal problems was located at approximately 322º (i.e., women tended to
report greater problems related to high warmth and low dominance). They predicted that the
maximal gender differences would be approximately an effect size of r = .16, which converts to a
Cohen’s d of 0.32.
Behavioral observation provides a stronger test of the extent of gender differences,
compared to self-reports. For example, to the extent that there are gender differences in people’s
willingness to endorse different statements, or that gender stereotypes affect one’s self-
perceptions, estimates of gender differences based on self-report methods may be inflated. For
example, a previous EAR study dispelled the popular notion that women talk more than men,
showing that, instead, both genders tend to talk a similar amount (Mehl, Vazire, Ramírez-
Esparza, Slatcher, & Pennebaker, 2007).
7 8
Taken as a whole, existing work implies that we should expect the largest gender
differences on behaviors in the IPC octants that capture opposing blends of warmth and
dominance. This would imply that women will express behaviors in the unassuming–ingenuous
octant (i.e., gratitude), which represents a blend of high warmth and low dominance, more
frequently than men, whereas men will express behaviors in the arrogant–calculating octant (i.e.,
bragging, condescension, teasing, and blaming), which represents a blend of low warmth and
high dominance, more frequently than women. If women are higher on warmth than are men,
women might also be more likely to gossip positively, express sympathy, and praise others more
often, whereas men might be more likely to express sarcasm, criticize others, and gossip
negatively. If men are higher on dominance than women, they might more frequently express
behaviors in the assured–dominant octant (i.e., being funny), whereas women might more
frequently express behaviors in the unassured–submissive octant (i.e., apologizing). Finally,
there should be fewer gender differences in the octants that capture high warmth and high
dominance (i.e., helping and optimism), or low warmth and low dominance (i.e., complaining,
pessimism, and insecurity).
To give a few examples of empirical evidence that supports these ideas, Kashdan,
Mishra, Breen, and Froh (2009) found that women tend to be more grateful, perhaps because
they derive greater benefits from experiencing and expressing gratitude. Women self-report
bragging less than men (Palmer et al., 2016), perhaps because they experience greater backlash
(Miller, Cooke, Tsang, & Morgan, 1992; Rudman, 1998) and feel uncomfortable about violating
modesty norms (Smith & Huntoon, 2014). Using the EAR, Robbins and Karan (2020) found that
women tended to engage in more neutral gossip than did men. Men show greater humor
production ability, as measured by the ability to produce funny captions for cartoons (d = 0.38,
7 9
Greengross & Miller, 2011). It would be worthwhile to test whether this means that men also
spontaneously express more humor in everyday interpersonal interactions. Finally, using the
experience sampling method, Schumann and Ross (2010) found that women reported offering
more apologies than men because they have a lower threshold for what constitutes offensive
behavior. Thus, overall, the goal of this research question is to provide a stronger test of the
extent to which men and women differ in their everyday interpersonal behaviors.
Social Consequences
1): the links between interpersonal behavior and social consequences—specifically, being liked
by and getting along with one’s friends. In two-dimensional models of person perception, being
liked tends to be more strongly correlated with communal traits than with agentic traits
(Wojciszke, Abele, & Baryla, 2009; Wortman & Wood, 2011). This is likely because communal
traits serve the interests of others, and is in line with Pinker’s (1997) functional interpretation of
liking as an emotion which is: “roughly, a willingness to offer someone a favor, and is directed
to those who appear willing to offer favors back. We like people who are nice to us, and we are
nice to people whom we like” (p. 404). This implies that a) behaviors in the warm–agreeable
octant of the IPC should be most positively associated with being liked, whereas those in the
cold–hearted octant should be most negatively associated with being liked, that b) behaviors in
the gregarious–extraverted and unassuming–ingenuous octants should be positively associated
with being liked, whereas those in the arrogant–calculating and aloof–introverted octants should
be negatively associated with being liked, and that c) behaviors in the assured–dominant and
unassured–submissive octants should be relatively uncorrelated with being liked.
8 0
Providing some support for the directions of these effects, an early study of the likeability
of 555 traits found high likeability ratings (ratings > 4.43 on a 0–6 scale) for being humorous,
helpful, grateful, sympathetic, and optimistic, and low likeability ratings (< 2.10) for bragging,
being gossipy, critical, pessimistic, insecure, sarcastic, and complaining (Anderson, 1968; see
Chandler, 2018 for a recent replication study that found very similar results). One limitation of
this approach is that reports of which traits are perceived as being most likeable may not
necessarily correspond to how these traits are related to being liked by others in real-world
relationships.
In another study, Lott, Lott, Reed, and Crow (1970) asked participants to think of three
people who they very much liked, very much disliked, and felt relatively neutral about.
Participants then chose three trait adjectives (from a set of 200 adjectives) that most
appropriately described each person. They found that people who were liked (vs. disliked or
neutral) tended to be described as friendly, helpful, and humorous, whereas those who were
disliked (vs. liked or neutral) were described as complaining, egotistical, overcritical,
quarrelsome, fault-finding, boastful, conceited, ungrateful, and unsympathetic. More recently,
Wortman and Wood (2011) examined the associations between 58 traits (self-reports) and being
liked by one’s peers (informant-reports). Insecurity and being funny were relatively uncorrelated
with being liked. There was some evidence that being unsympathetic was associated with being
disliked, but this was inconsistent across the two samples. The findings that humility was
associated with being liked, whereas being conceited/egotistical was associated with being
disliked, suggests that bragging should be associated with being disliked. Finally, gratitude was
associated with being liked.
8 1
Both of these studies (Lott et al., 1970; Wortman & Wood, 2011) provide a better sense
of why people are liked or disliked, at least from the perspective of informants, but do not
answer the question of how much everyday behavioral manifestations of these traits are
associated with being liked. Here, I use a multi-method approach to examine the association
between actual behaviors (rather than self-reports) and being liked.
Method
Informant Nomination and Reports
During the initial laboratory session, participants nominated up to 10 informants of
different types (e.g., friend, local best friend, local friend, hometown friend, sibling, romantic
partner, ex-romantic partner, parent). Informants provided reports of the participants’ traits and
interpersonal outcomes (described below). Because romantic partners and parents tend to be
more biased informants (Murray, Holmes, Dolderman, & Griffin, 2000; Solomon & Vazire,
2014), I only included informants who were friends (a decision I made before analyzing the
data). The final analyses included 641 informants (185 men and 454 women) who were aged
between 18–44 years (M = 19.43, SD = 2.42).
Measures
Means, standard deviations, reliability estimates, and intercorrelations among the
Trait measures. Participants completed self-report measures of the Big Five traits,
morality, narcissism, self-esteem, satisfaction with life, religiosity, and funniness. Because
previous research suggests that people may have less self-knowledge of highly-evaluative traits
(Vazire, 2010), I also included informant-reports of morality and funniness, which are highly
evaluative. I report the results separately for self- and informant-reports of these traits.

informant-reported measures (morality, funny, likeability, and liking). Correlations ≥ |.13| (except for the association between
extraversion and being liked) are significant at p < .05 (not corrected for multiple comparisons).
Big Five traits. Participants completed the Big Five Inventory (BFI–44; John &
Srivastava, 1999), which measures trait extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness,
neuroticism, and openness. All responses were made on a 15-point scale (1 = Disagree strongly,
8 = Neither agree nor disagree, 15 = Agree strongly). I computed composites by taking the mean
of all items for each scale (after reverse-coding negatively-keyed items).
Narcissism. Participants completed a 16-item short version of the Narcissistic Personality
Inventory (NPI-16; Ames, Rose, & Anderson, 2006). These 16 item pairs were selected from the
original NPI-40 (Raskin & Terry, 1988) on the basis of face validity (i.e., being primarily
representative of narcissism rather than related but distinct constructs) and coverage of domains.
Each of the 16 item pairs contained a narcissistic statement (e.g., “I really like to be the center of
attention”) and a non-narcissistic statement (e.g., “It makes me uncomfortable to be the center of
attention”). Participants chose the statement within each item pair that best described them. The
resulting composite was based on the proportion of narcissistic responses (i.e., with a possible
range from 0 to 1).
Trait morality. Participants and their informants completed an ad hoc 1-item measure of
global morality (“I am/[target’s name] is someone who is moral/does the right thing”; 1 =
Disagree strongly, 8 = Neither agree nor disagree, 15 = Agree strongly).
Self-esteem. Participants rated their global self-esteem using a single item, “I am
someone who has high self-esteem” (1 = Disagree strongly, 15 = agree strongly). Similar 1-item
measures of self-esteem have been previously validated (Robins, Hendin, & Trzesniewski,
2001).
Satisfaction with life. Participants rated their life satisfaction using a single item, “How
satisfied are you with your: life”, on a scale from 1 = Completely dissatisfied to 15 = Completely
8 4
satisfied. Similar 1-item measures of life satisfaction have been previously validated (Lucas &
Donnellan, 2012).
Religiosity. Participants reported their religiosity using a single item: “How religious are
you?” (1 = Not at all religious, 4 = Somewhat religious, 7 = Very religious).
Trait funniness. Participants and their informants completed an ad hoc 1-item measure of
how funny the participant is (“I am/[target’s name] is funny”; 1 = Disagree strongly, 8 = Neither
agree nor disagree, 15 = Agree strongly).
Interpersonal outcomes. I included informant reports of general likeability, being liked
by the informants, and relationship quality. Conceptually, I consider these to be outcome
variables. However, because the data are correlational, I cannot draw strong conclusions about
the causal direction of the correlations. For example, it is possible that participants’ behaviors
cause their informants to like or dislike them, or that participants who are liked by their friends
feel more comfortable expressing certain behaviors around them (i.e., reverse causality). It is
also possible that a third variable (e.g., personality traits) explains the associations between
interpersonal behaviors and being liked.
Likeability. Informants completed a 1-item measure of how likeable the participant is
(“[target's name] is someone who is likeable”; 1 = Disagree strongly, 8 = Neither agree nor
disagree, 15 = Agree strongly).
Being liked by friends. Informants also rated how much they liked the participant (“How
much do you like [target's name]?”; 1 = Not at all, 7 = Very much).
Relationship quality. Finally, informants completed two indicators of relationship quality
(“How satisfied are you with your relationship with [target's name]?”, 1 = Not at all, 7 =
Extremely satisfied; “How would you rate the quality of your relationship with [target's name]?”,
8 5
1 = Not at all, 7 = Extremely good), which I combined into a two-item composite by taking the
mean of these two items.
Data Analyses
To aggregate the informant-report data, I averaged the scores across all available
informants for a given target. Almost all (n = 198) participants had two or more informants, 53
participants had one informant, and 36 participants had no informants. I computed zero-order
correlations to address the research questions about trait correlates and social consequences, and
conducted t-tests to examine gender differences.
Sensitivity power analyses showed that I had 80% power to detect correlations ≥ |.16| for
the self-reported measures and ≥ |.18| for the informant-reported measures. With 91 men and 194
women, I had 80% power to detect medium-sized gender differences (standardized ds) ≥ |0.36|.
For the gender differences, I report unstandardized effect sizes which represent absolute
differences in the percentages of conversations in which men or women expressed a given
behavior. To facilitate comparability of effect sizes with the personality trait correlations, I also
report two standardized effect sizes: Cohen’s d and the R2. Because the R2 is the square of a
correlation, these effect sizes can be readily converted back into a correlation.
Given the exploratory nature of this study, I used a conventional p < .05 threshold as a
heuristic for identifying new hypotheses to be tested in future studies. This approach prioritizes
reducing Type II error over Type I error. However, to provide additional context on which
results might be less likely to be due to chance, I also indicate which effects survive a false
discovery rate (FDR) correction (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995). I applied this correction
separately for each research question (trait correlates, gender differences, and social
consequences).
8 6
To provide a complementary metric of the extent to which the overall set of results might
be due to chance, I also conducted randomization tests for each research question.
Randomization tests (Block, 1960; Sherman & Funder, 2009) test whether the overall set of
personality correlates, gender differences, and social consequences obtained in this dissertation
would be expected to occur by chance. Whereas the FDR correction addresses the question of
which specific effects should be considered significant, randomization tests answer the question
of whether the set of findings, as a whole, provide evidence for the broader claims that a) traits
are associated with this set of interpersonal behaviors, b) gender differences in this set of
interpersonal behaviors exist, and c) this set of interpersonal behaviors is associated with
interpersonal outcomes.
The randomization test procedure involves the following steps: 1) randomly re-assign
scores on the outcome variables (e.g., the 18 interpersonal behaviors) from one participant to the
set of predictor variables (e.g., traits) from a random participant, thus creating a new pseudo-
sample; 2) compute the effect size between each predictor variable and the outcome variable; 3)
record the number of uncorrected p < .05 effects obtained in this pseudo-sample; 4) repeat steps
1–3 many times to create approximate chance sampling distributions of the number of significant
effects. Thus, this process simulates random relationships between personality and interpersonal
behavior, between gender and interpersonal behavior, and between interpersonal behavior and
interpersonal outcomes, while maintaining the dependencies among each set of variables (e.g.,
the covariations among the set of interpersonal behaviors). Calculating the proportion of pseudo-
datasets that produce as many or more significant effects as the number of significant effects
observed in the real dataset yields a p value that indicates the probability of obtaining the original
results under chance. I conducted 10,000 such simulations for each research question.
8 7
Results
Personality Trait Correlates
Across 286 correlations (13 traits × 18 individual behaviors and 4 behavioral
composites), 29 effects were detectable under a liberal p < .05 threshold, which I use as a
effects, only one effect survived a FDR correction—the negative association between satisfaction
with life and expressions of insecurity. However, randomization tests on 10,000 pseudo-datasets
showed that the observed number of 29 correlations in the real dataset was significantly greater
than the 14.28 correlations that would be expected by chance, p = .0017 (i.e., only 0.17% of
these pseudo-datasets had a greater or equal number of correlates compared to the 29 correlates
that were observed in the real dataset). Although randomization tests cannot speak to which
specific effects are robust, these results do suggest that the overall set of associations is unlikely
to be spurious. In other words, this provides evidence for the existence of associations between
these personality traits and interpersonal behaviors.
Are interpersonal traits associated with interpersonal behavior? Out of the set of
traits I considered, extraversion, agreeableness, and narcissism are the traits that are most
conceptually related to interpersonal behavior. Thus, I began by examining the associations
interpersonal traits were only weakly correlated with the set of 18 interpersonal behaviors, with
average absolute correlations ranging between r = .06–.07. The detectable correlations that
emerged suggested that extraverts more frequently bragged, teased, gossiped in general, gossiped
negatively, and expressed gratitude. Agreeable people were less frequently condescending,
sarcastic, and funny. Apart from these findings, agreeableness had surprisingly few behavioral
8 8
correlates considering its conceptual relevance to prosocial and antagonistic behaviors. Finally,
narcissists more frequently expressed condescension, mocked and teased others, and bragged.
None of these associations survived a FDR correction.
To what extent are these behaviors “moral”? Another key goal of this chapter was to
test Bollich and colleagues’ (2016) assumption that expressions of gratitude, praise, sympathy,
help, apologizing, and optimism are indicative of positive moral conduct (i.e., “positive moral
behaviors”), whereas sarcasm, bragging, condescension, complaining, criticism, blame, and
pessimism are indicative of negative moral conduct (i.e., “negative moral behaviors”). I tested
this assumption by examining whether these behaviors were correlated with self- and informant-
reports of trait morality.
behaviors were reflective of moral character. Out of the set of “positive moral behaviors”, only
apologizing was detectably positively associated with self-reported morality, and none of these
behaviors were associated with informant-reported morality. Interestingly, the supportiveness
composite was also weakly associated with self-reported morality, but none of the correlations
with the individual behaviors of sympathy, optimism, helping, and praise were detectable. Out of
the set of “negative moral behaviors”, only condescension and bragging were detectably
negatively associated with informant-reported morality. In addition, blame was positively
associated with self-reported morality, which suggests that if anything, the tendency to blame
others might be an indicator of positive (rather than negative) moral character. None of these
associations survived a FDR correction.

Effects that survived a false discovery rate correction are shown in boldface.
Which additional traits are associated with interpersonal behavior? Finally, I
explored the interpersonal behavioral manifestations of an additional set of traits. The average
absolute correlations for the remaining Big Five domains of conscientiousness, neuroticism, and
openness were in the .06–.07 range. This suggests that these conceptually less interpersonal traits
were nevertheless associated with the set of interpersonal behaviors to a similar extent as were
the interpersonal domains of extraversion and agreeableness. Specifically, conscientious people
tended to more frequently express supportiveness, optimism, praise, and gratitude, neurotic
people expressed more insecurity and apologized more, and open people were less inclined to
tease others. None of these associations survived a FDR correction.
Next, I examined the associations between interpersonal behaviors and additional traits
that fit less well into the Big Five taxonomy: self-esteem, satisfaction with life, religiosity, and
being funny. Self-esteem, like narcissism, reflects positive self-views. However, self-esteem was
associated with less frequent expressions of insecurity, but was not detectably associated with the
behavioral manifestations of narcissism (i.e., condescension, bragging, mockery, and teasing).
These results therefore support the conceptual distinction between self-esteem and narcissism.
Satisfaction with life—a broad indicator of personal well-being—was also manifested in several
interpersonal behaviors. Specifically, people who were more satisfied with their lives tended to
complain less, express less insecurity, and brag more. Adding to the mixed literature on the link
between religiosity and prosocial behavior, religiosity was associated with being less likely to
express sympathy. Self- and informant-reports of funniness were both associated with more
frequently teasing others. People who saw themselves as being funny also more frequently
criticized and mocked others, and less frequently expressed insecurity. Finally, people whose
informants saw them as being funny more frequently did things that were funny (from the
9 1
perspective of the EAR coders). Out of these correlations, only the negative association between
satisfaction with life and expressions of insecurity survived a FDR correction.
Gender Differences
Next, I examined the extent to which men and women differed in how often they
expressed these interpersonal behaviors. Out of 22 gender differences (18 specific behaviors and
these effects survived a FDR correction: compared to men, women tended to spend a larger
percentage of conversations praising others, gossiping in general, gossiping negatively,
expressing insecurity, and expressing gratitude. The other detectable effects were that women
tended to spend a larger percentage of conversations complaining and gossiping neutrally or
positively, whereas men tended to be more condescending; however, these effects did not
survive a FDR correction. Randomization tests on 10,000 pseudo-datasets showed that the
observed number of 8 gender differences in the real dataset was significantly greater than the
1.10 gender differences that would be expected by chance, p = .002. This provides evidence for
the existence of gender differences among this set of 18 interpersonal behaviors.
In terms of absolute percentages, these gender differences reflected differences in the
range of 1–2% of conversations. Gender also explained at most 5% of the variance in each of
these interpersonal behaviors. However, the standardized estimates were in the moderate to large
range, with the largest differences in praise (d = 0.50) and insecurity (d = 0.46), and moderate
differences for gossip and negative gossip (ds = 0.36) and gratitude (d = 0.39). These 95%
confidence intervals typically captured effects that ranged from small to relatively large.

Social Consequences
Finally, I examined whether these interpersonal behaviors had any implications for
friend-reported social consequences. The outcomes of interest were a) being seen as a likeable
person, b) being liked by one’s friends, and c) the quality of one’s relationships with friends. As
correlations, only 6 were detectable under a liberal p < .05 threshold. Specifically, those who
bragged more tended to be liked less, those who were funnier tended to be liked more, those who
complained more had better relationships with their friends, and teasing was positively
associated with all three interpersonal outcomes (rs = .16–.18). For comparison, the strongest
correlation between self-reported personality traits and interpersonal outcomes was .17 for the
impressive that a single behavior—teasing—was as strongly correlated with these three
interpersonal outcomes as were any of these personality traits (which should capture a broad
range of behaviors that are relevant to being liked and getting along with one’s friends).
However, none of these effects survived a FDR correction. Moreover, randomization
tests on 10,000 pseudo-datasets showed that the observed number of 6 correlations in the real
dataset was not detectably different from the 3.31 correlations that would be expected by chance,
p = .189. Thus, these correlations might be spurious and provide little evidence for the idea that
these interpersonal behaviors are associated with friend-reported social consequences.

Discussion
In summary, this chapter explored the correlates and social consequences of everyday
interpersonal behaviors. Although I took an exploratory approach and ran many analyses,
randomization tests provided evidence for the broad conclusions that personality traits are
manifested in everyday interpersonal behaviors and that men and women express different
frequencies of these behaviors. However, I found little evidence for the idea that these
9 5
interpersonal behaviors were associated with friend-reported interpersonal outcomes. Below, I
highlight interesting patterns and discuss the implications of these results.
Behavioral Implications of Personality Traits
Do personality trait measures capture behavior-relevant tendencies? Are traits connected
with behavior in a decontextualized way? Have the interpersonal implications of traits beyond
the extraversion, agreeableness, and honesty-humility domains been underappreciated? These are
the kinds of questions I hoped to address by exploring the associations between a large set of
personality traits and interpersonal behaviors.
Overall, the detectable correlates that emerged (under a very liberal p < .05 threshold for
exploratory findings) were generally consistent with existing conceptualizations of these traits.
For example, agreeable people were less condescending and sarcastic. Neurotic people expressed
more insecurity and were more apologetic. Those who were satisfied with their lives complained
less frequently and expressed less insecurity. Consistent with the distinction between narcissism
and self-esteem (Campbell et al., 2002), narcissism and self-esteem showed distinct detectable
behavioral profiles: whereas narcissists tended to be more condescending and mocked, bragged,
and teased others more often, those who were higher on self-esteem were only less likely to
express insecurity.
Although these effect sizes tended to be small (in the range of |.12–.22| for the detectable
correlates), these results show that self-reports of personality traits are manifested in
conceptually-relevant behaviors in everyday life. In other words, instead of capturing only
subjective thoughts and feelings, self-reported traits also make it out of the head in the form of
behaviors that can be observed by and potentially impact other people. In doing so, these results
reveal the concrete behavioral implications of various personality traits—an issue I will explore
9 6
further in Chapter 6. In addition, because these associations emerged without explicitly
measuring and modeling the effects of context, this suggests either that traits are manifested in
behavior in a decontextualized way (McAdams & Pals, 2006) or that the relevant eliciting
stimuli tend to be broad classes that are often present (DeYoung, 2015).
However, agreeableness had surprisingly few interpersonal behavioral correlates,
considering its theoretical relevance to prosocial and antagonistic behaviors. Although agreeable
people were less sarcastic and condescending, I found no evidence that they were more
supportive, sympathetic, helpful, grateful, and apologetic, or that they were less inclined to
complain, criticize, and blame others. Several of these null associations may be due to the low
reliability with which the behaviors were measured. However, because other traits were
detectably correlated with these behaviors despite the low reliability of these behaviors, this
cannot be the only explanation.
One possible methodological explanation is that measurement at the level of the domain
lacked fidelity, in that trait agreeableness was not closely matched enough with the behavioral
criteria to be able to predict these criteria with high accuracy (Ashton, Jackson, Paunonen,
Helmes, & Rothstein, 1995; Paunonen & Ashton, 2001). Hierarchical models of the Big Five
show that trait domains subsume narrower traits, described as aspects or facets (e.g., Costa &
McCrae, 1995; DeYoung et al., 2007; Soto & John, 2017). Whereas the compassion aspect of
agreeableness captures active emotional concern for others’ well-being (and should therefore be
more related to behaviors such as sympathy and helping), the politeness or respectfulness aspect
involves inhibiting aggressive or antagonistic impulses (and should therefore be more negatively
related to behaviors such as criticism, complaining, condescension, blame, and sarcasm). Finer-
9 7
grained measurement might facilitate the discovery of the behavioral correlates of specific
aspects of agreeableness.
These results might also suggest that the connection between agreeableness and
interpersonal behavior is complex. Rather than being straightforwardly associated with
interpersonal behavior averaged across all situations, agreeableness might only be manifested
behaviorally under specific conditions. Agreeableness might also predict the thoughts and
feelings that accompany interpersonal behaviors, rather than how often people engage in these
behaviors. I will return to each of these possibilities in the general discussion (Chapter 7).
Finally, these results may suggest that people do not infer their agreeableness from how often
they enact prosocial and antagonistic behaviors and that they lack self-knowledge of their
agreeableness (e.g., Sun & Vazire, 2019).
Finally, beyond confirming the behavioral implications that are consistent with existing
conceptualizations of these traits, I also hoped to expand current conceptualizations of traits by
revealing their less obvious behavioral implications. For example, although humor is not inherent
to the definition of agreeableness, I found that agreeable people tended to be less funny in
funniness was associated with criticizing others, the mockery factor, and teasing, this suggests
that agreeable people may be less funny to the extent that they are less willing to engage in forms
of humor that come at the expense of others. In addition, people who were satisfied with their
lives not only complained and expressed insecurity less frequently—they also bragged more,
perhaps because they have more daily satisfactions to share.
9 8
Two additional findings were somewhat more puzzling. First, religious people tended to
express less sympathy in their everyday conversations, further adding to the mixed literature on
the links between religiosity and prosocial behavior (Tsang et al., 2015). It was also unclear why
openness was negatively associated with teasing. This was opposite to the positive correlation
between openness and act-frequency self-reports of “Made fun of someone” (Chapman &
Goldberg, 2017). Although these puzzling findings might be spurious, they nevertheless suggest
that actual behavior can reveal a different picture compared to self-report measures.
Finally, these findings raise the question of what it means for a trait to be “interpersonal”.
Several traits that are less inherently defined by interpersonal behavior (e.g., conscientiousness,
neuroticism, satisfaction with life, self-esteem) were nevertheless manifested in a variety of
conceptually-relevant interpersonal behaviors. For example, whereas there was little evidence
that agreeableness was correlated with prosocial behaviors, conscientious people tended to be
more supportive, express more optimism and gratitude, and praise others more often. I also
computed average absolute correlations for each trait in order to explore which traits were
particularly strongly associated with the full set of interpersonal behaviors. Generally, there was
little evidence that traits that were conceptually more relevant to interpersonal behavior
(extraversion, agreeableness, narcissism, morality, and being funny; average |r| = .061) were
systematically more strongly associated with this set of 18 behaviors, compared with traits that
were conceptually less relevant to interpersonal behavior (conscientiousness, neuroticism, self-
esteem, satisfaction with life, religiosity; average |r| = .057). This suggests that all traits—even
those that are not explicitly defined by interpersonal behaviors—have some implications for
interpersonal behavior.
Clarifying the Meaning of Everyday Interpersonal Behaviors
9 9
Just as revealing the behavioral implications of personality trait measures can help to
establish their construct validity, trait–behavior correlations can also clarify the meaning of
everyday interpersonal behaviors. In Chapter 3, I began to explore the shared interpersonal
meanings that might underlie specific behaviors. Although the four behavioral composites of
negativity, supportiveness, mockery, and gossip formed reasonably reliable factors, Chapter 4
showed that only two of the four behavioral composites—mockery and gossip—showed some
amount of rank-order stability over time. In this chapter, I further explored the validity and utility
of the four composites by correlating them with trait measures.
One of the principles behind creating behavioral composites was that broader, more
reliable composites should be more strongly associated with trait measures. However, this was
not the case. The negativity factor had no detectable trait correlates, supportiveness and mockery
each only had two trait correlates, and gossip only had one trait correlate. A greater number of
associations emerged at the level of individual behaviors, and the correlations between traits and
individual behaviors within these factors tended to be quite specific (e.g., agreeableness was
negatively associated with condescension, but was not detectably associated with any of the
other behaviors within the negativity factor). This suggests that even if the behaviors that load
onto these factors do reflect broader shared meanings, specific behaviors might still be a more
useful unit of analysis. It also suggests that human coders were able to make fine-grained
distinctions between closely-related behaviors (e.g., criticism vs. blame).
I also aimed to test whether the behaviors measured by Bollich and colleagues (2016)
were indeed indicative of positive and negative moral conduct. I found relatively little support
for this idea, across self- and informant-reported measures of morality. Self-reported morality
was positively associated with the supportiveness factor (but not detectably so with the
10 0
individual behaviors) and apologizing. This provides some indication that apologizing and a
composite of supportive behaviors (sympathy, optimism, helping, and praise) may be weak
indicators of positive moral behavior. In contrast, expressions of gratitude in everyday
conversations may be less relevant to moral character (even if gratitude is generally seen as a
moral virtue; e.g., DeSteno, Bartlett, Baumann, Williams, & Dickens, 2010; McCullough,
Kilpatrick, Emmons, & Larson, 2001; Peterson & Seligman, 2004). None of these associations
replicated when examining informant-reported measures of morality.
Moreover, there was no evidence that any of the “negative” behaviors (pessimism,
criticism, complaining, condescension, blame, bragging, and sarcasm) were negatively
associated with self-reported morality. In fact, people who saw themselves as being more moral
spent a greater proportion of their everyday conversations blaming others. This raises the
possibility that people think that holding others accountable for their misdeeds reflects positively
on one’s own moral character. This is consistent with the perspective that blame is a public act of
moral criticism that serves as a key mechanism for the regulation of social behavior (Malle,
Guglielmo, & Monroe, 2014).
Two additional associations emerged in the informant-reports: informant-reported
morality was negatively correlated with both condescension and bragging, suggesting that other-
judgments of a target’s moral character might be partially shaped by perceptions of the target’s
condescension and boastfulness. The finding that condescension and boastfulness may be
especially diagnostic of poor moral character is consistent with the finding that negative
behaviors are more diagnostic for immorality because only immoral people would be expected to
engage in negative acts (whereas moral behaviors are expected to be performed by both moral
and immoral people; Skowronski & Carlston, 1987). Trafimow and Trafimow (1999) further
10 1
found that people change their moral evaluations of others at a faster rate in response to
violations of perfect duties (which are moral rules that should absolutely never be broken, e.g.,
dishonesty; Kant, 1797/1991) compared to violations of imperfect duties (flexible “duties of
virtue” that do not always have to be obeyed, e.g., charity). Thus, these results could suggest that
condescension and boastfulness are more diagnostic of poor moral character because they are
seen as violations of perfect duties, whereas behaviors such as helpfulness and sympathy are
merely imperfect duties.
Taken as a whole, there was little evidence that Bollich and colleagues’ (2016) “moral
behaviors” were related to self- or informant-reports of morality, which I used as criterion
measures of moral character. When two measures disagree (e.g., self-report vs. behavior), either
or both of the measures could be invalid. Thus, although one interpretation is that these
behaviors are not valid indicators of moral character, a second interpretation is that it was the
self- and informant-report criterion measures that were invalid. This could be the case,
considering that the measure was only 1 item long and that self- and informant-report measures
of morality contain disturbingly high amounts of evaluative bias (up to 60%; Barranti, 2019).
Evaluative bias, which captures the tendency to indiscriminately rate oneself more positively or
negatively across a set of evaluative traits (rather than in a differentiated way within the set of
evaluative traits), has an especially big impact on the accuracy of self-reports (Vazire, 2010). A
third criterion for moral character would be needed to adjudicate between these two possibilities.
Still, despite these ambiguities, these results call into question the interpretation of Bollich and
colleagues’ (2016) behaviors as being moral or immoral and show that validity should not be
taken for granted.
10 2
The question of whether such behaviors are indicators of positive or negative moral
character is not only an empirical issue. Such an interpretation could also be justified on
theoretical grounds. This requires a clear definition of what constitutes moral behavior.
Functional perspectives on morality conceptualize moral systems as sets of values and rules that
suppress selfishness and make cooperative social life possible (Haidt & Kesebir, 2010). These
systems provide a basis for judging which behaviors are “good” or “bad”, “ethical” or
“unethical”, and “moral” or “immoral.” One complexity is that people disagree on which specific
principles are relevant to morality (as opposed to matters of social convention or personal
preference; Graham, Haidt, & Nosek, 2009; Graham, Meindl, Beall, Johnson, & Zhang, 2016;
Meindl & Graham, 2014). However, it may be possible to justify defining behaviors such as
helping and sympathy as being “moral” to the extent that they are indicative of prototypical
moral virtues (e.g., compassion, fairness, honesty; Goodwin et al., 2014; Peterson & Seligman,
2004).
A second consideration is whether the morality of a given act depends on the
accompanying thoughts, feelings, and motives. Empirical evidence shows that moral character
attributions depend not only on what people do, but also the intentionality of their morally
relevant actions (Malle, 2006), how quickly they come to their moral decisions (Critcher, Inbar,
& Pizarro, 2013), the selflessness of their motives (Barasch, Levine, Berman, & Small, 2014;
Newman & Cain, 2014), and whether they found it easy or struggled to do the right thing
(Berman & Small, 2018; Starmans & Bloom, 2016). It may well be the case that the
interpretation of behaviors depends much more on thoughts and feelings for moral traits than for
non-moral traits (e.g., “talkativeness” can be straightforwardly interpreted as being an
extraverted act without knowledge of what the actor was thinking and feeling).
10 3
Finally, based on Aristotle’s doctrine of the golden mean (Aristotle, trans. 1985, p. 44),
Ng and Tay (2020) have convincingly argued that moral virtue should be conceptualized as
consistently expressing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that optimal (i.e., neither deficient nor
excessive) for a given situation. In this view, the relation between behavior and moral virtue is
characterized by situation-specific optimality, rather than average behavioral tendencies (as is
assumed by trait conceptualizations of moral character; e.g., Fleeson et al., 2014; Peterson &
Seligman, 2004). It remains an empirical question as to whether accounting for situation-specific
optimality better predicts virtue-relevant outcomes, compared to simply capturing average
behavioral tendencies. Nevertheless, such theoretical complexities in defining what it means for
an act to be moral show that thorough conceptual analysis is a crucial first step in the
development of valid behavioral measures of morality.
Relative Effect Sizes for Personality Traits vs. Gender Differences
Another goal of this chapter was to explore gender differences in interpersonal behavior.
Across all 18 behaviors, the mean absolute gender difference was d = 0.20. Gender explained an
average of 1.27% of the variance across the full set of 18 behaviors and four factors; taking the
square root of the unrounded average R2 corresponds to an effect size of r = .11. This is larger
15). In other words, if we have access to only one piece of information about a person, gender
provides more information about overall differences in this set of interpersonal behaviors than
does any single personality trait.
Several of these findings are consistent with either past work or what would be implied
by hypothetical IPC locations. The finding that women spend a greater proportion of their
conversations gossiping is consistent with Robbins and Karan’s (2020) EAR study, which found
10 4
that women spent a greater proportion of their waking files gossiping neutrally (with point
estimates also in the direction of women more frequently engaging in negative and positive
gossip). Consistent with Kashdan and colleagues (2009), women also expressed gratitude more
frequently than did men. The finding that women also tended to praise others more often is also
consistent with the high warmth of this behavior. Men tended to be more condescending,
consistent with the perspective that men would more frequently express high-dominance, low-
warmth behaviors. Finally, although the gender difference in apologizing was not detectable, the
point estimate was in the direction of women apologizing more (consistent with Schumann &
Ross, 2010), with a 95% CI that just captured zero.
Other gender differences, or the lack thereof, were less expected. For example, it was less
clear whether there would be gender differences in complaining and insecurity, which reflect a
combination of low warmth and high dominance. Yet, women tended to manifest both of these
behaviors more often than did men. There were also very few detectable differences in the
behaviors that I hypothesized to be located in the cold-hearted and arrogant–calculating IPC
octants. For example, although women self-report bragging less than men (Palmer et al., 2016), I
found no evidence that they bragged less during naturalistic conversations. The point estimate
was in the direction of men bragging more, but the wide 95% confidence interval indicates that
we cannot rule out effects between d = 0.15 (women bragging more) and –0.35 (men bragging
more). There was also no evidence to suggest that men were funnier in their everyday
conversations, as would be implied by the perspective that humor ability is a fitness indicator
that is more highly valued in a mate by women (Greengross & Miller, 2011). If anything, the
point estimate was in the opposite direction. However, it should be noted that the EAR coders
may have been interpreting the item, “Did or said something funny”, as including anything that
10 5
they personally found funny (e.g., unusual behaviors), rather than only expressions of humor.
Finally, the null gender difference for sympathy can likely be attributed to the low reliability of
the behavioral codings for sympathy.
Little Evidence for Friend-Reported Social Consequences
Finally, there was very little evidence that these interpersonal behaviors had implications
for friend-reported social consequences. The exceptions were that teasing was positively
correlated with all three outcomes (likeability, being liked by friends, relationship quality), those
who bragged more were liked less, those who complained more had better relationships with
their friends, and those who were funnier were liked more by their friends. The unexpectedly
positive interpersonal implications of teasing might suggest that teasing can be a warm and
playful (rather than antagonistic) behavior in the context of intimate relationships. I was also
surprised by the positive correlation between complaining and relationship quality, considering
that previous studies implied that complainers would be disliked (Anderson, 1968; Lott et al.,
1970). This could suggest reverse causality, such that people with better friendships feel more
comfortable complaining out loud to their friends. However, given that none of these correlations
survived a FDR correction and randomization tests suggested that this set of correlations could
be spurious, these findings should not be over-interpreted.
Why were there so few correlations between these interpersonal behaviors and friend-
reported social consequences? One possibility is that the way that participants treated all of the
people they interacted with on average was not necessarily representative of how they treated the
friends who provided ratings of the outcomes. For example, participants may have been
especially sympathetic or helpful towards their friend informants. In addition, because these
informants were friends, there was limited variability on the measures of likeability and liking,
10 6
which reduced the ability to detect behavioral correlates. Indeed, 73% of the liking scores were ≥
6 on a 7-point scale. There was more variability on the likeability measure, but this was also
highly skewed towards positive scores. Providing some support for the impact of limited
variability, these interpersonal outcomes were also barely correlated with self-reported
The broader issue that this highlights is that the use of friends as informants represents an
important constraint on generality. Although it might be true that interpersonal behaviors
expressed across all interactions may not be that strongly connected with how much a person is
liked by their friends, these results cannot speak to how much these behaviors matter for being
liked in general. To gain a more complete picture of the social consequences of bragging,
condescension, gratitude, and other such behaviors, future studies should recruit relatively
neutral informants who know the participant well but are not necessarily friends with them (e.g.,
co-workers, friends-of-friends), as well informants who dislike the participant (Leising, Erbs, &
Fritz, 2010). An ideal study would also capture the identity of the interaction partners during
each social interaction. This would reveal the social consequences of how a person treats specific
interaction partners.

Chapter 6: Calibration of Arbitrary Metrics
In Chapter 5, I uncovered several correlations between personality traits and everyday
interpersonal behaviors. The goal of this chapter is to make the implications of those correlations
more concrete by undertaking a process called metric calibration, which involves mapping
behavioral counts onto specific scores on personality trait measures.
Unlike physical concepts (e.g., height and weight), very few psychological measures
provide direct information about a person’s absolute standing on the underlying psychological
construct (Blanton & Jaccard, 2006; Sechrest, McKnight, & McKnight, 1996). A metric refers to
the numbering system that is used to describe a person’s standing on the construct of interest. A
metric is arbitrary when a given number on a scale provides no information about where a person
lies on the underlying dimension, and when we do not know how much true change is reflected
by a one-unit change on the scale. For example, the Big Five Inventory (BFI; John et al., 2008)
measures agreeableness using nine questions answered on a 5-point scale, averaged together. We
can infer that a person who scores “5” on the BFI agreeableness scale has a higher level of
agreeableness than someone who scores “3”. However, the scores themselves do not
meaningfully locate a person on the underlying dimension of interest. For example, we cannot
infer that a person who scores “5” is at the maximum possible level of the underlying
agreeableness continuum, nor that a person who scores “3” (the midpoint of the scale) is at the
true “neutral” point of agreeableness. Nor do the scores reveal how a person who scores “5”
treats others differently compared to a person who scores “3”.
It is, however, possible to reduce the arbitrariness of such metrics by mapping them onto
meaningful external referents. I argue that the most meaningful external referents are real-world
behaviors, and, in the case of traits that capture interpersonal phenomena, naturally-occurring
10 8
interpersonal behaviors. By examining, for example, how a 1-point difference in BFI
agreeableness translates into differences in everyday interpersonal behaviors such as helping
others and expressing sympathy, we can come to understand the concrete behavioral implications
of scores on otherwise arbitrary metrics. This kind of metric calibration is crucial for
understanding and communicating the behavioral implications of scores on widely-used scales
and the practical, real-world implications of psychological effects. Yet, to date, very few
researchers have explicitly attempted to do this.
Two notable exceptions come from work by Mehl (2007) and LeBel (2011). Using the
EAR, Mehl and colleagues (2006) found that extraversion was correlated with time spent alone
(r = –.27), and conscientiousness was correlated with time spent in class (r = .42). Unlike scores
on an arbitrary Likert scale, EAR-derived behavioral counts are intuitively meaningful and
directly interpretable. Thus, Mehl (2007) translated these correlations into intuitively
interpretable effect sizes by reporting unstandardized regression equations. This metric
calibration process showed that people who scored a “4” on the 5-point extraversion scale spent
approximately 10% less time alone than those who scored a “2” (70.8% vs. 61.4%, respectively),
and that those who scored a “4” on the 5-point conscientiousness scale spent three times more
time in class than those who scored a “2” (11.9% vs. 4.1%). LeBel (2011) also provided
meaningful behavioral mappings for measures of gregariousness, dutifulness, and self-control.
He showed, for example, that a 1-unit increase (on a 5-point scale) in gregariousness translated
into attending two more parties per month. However, unlike Mehl and colleagues’ work, which
used actual behavioral counts derived from naturalistic audio recordings, LeBel relied on self-
reports of these behavioral correlates.
10 9
As reviewed in Chapter 1, to the extent that interpersonal behaviors have been measured,
such observations have typically occurred in lab-based settings. Research using the EAR has
assessed a range of social behaviors, including many of the behaviors of interest in this
dissertation (Bollich et al., 2016; Kaplan et al., 2018; Robbins & Karan, 2020), but has typically
not explicitly mapped them onto specific scores on personality scales (cf. Mehl, 2007). Thus, the
goal of this chapter is to provide a better understanding of how arbitrary scores on personality
trait measures translate into differences in real-world interpersonal behaviors. This process will
impart greater meaning to these otherwise arbitrary metrics.
Method and Results
I conducted metric calibration analyses for the correlations between traits and individual
do so, I used unstandardized regression models to estimate the frequencies of these behaviors for
measures were on a 1–15 scale, except for narcissism (scored as a proportion) and religiosity (1–
7 scale). To facilitate comparability across scales, I rescaled all trait measures to a 0–10 scale.
For example, if the original measure was on a 1–15 scale, a score of 1 would be recoded as 0, a
score of 8 would be recoded as 5, and a score of 15 would be recoded as 10. I report the
estimated frequencies of these behaviors at the rescaled minimum, midpoint, and maximum
points of the scale. Because participants did not always use the full range of each scale, I also
report the estimated frequencies of these behaviors for the distribution of scores (lowest, median,
highest, and 1 SD above and below the mean) that were observed in this sample. This provides a
more realistic sense of the behavioral variations that are likely to be observed in practice. I report

Note. The unstandardized regression coefficient b represents the % increase in conversations that contained these behaviors for every 1
unit increase on the trait measure. All trait measures were rescaled to a 0–10 scale to facilitate comparability of effect sizes across trait
measures. Estimated frequencies of behaviors as a percentage of conversations are based on the point estimate of the b coefficient for
participants scoring at the lowest point (0), midpoint (5), or highest point (10) on the scale (“Full Range of Scale”), or the lowest, 1 SD
below the mean (–1 SD), median, 1 SD above the mean (+1 SD), and maximum scores observed in this sample (“Observed Scores”).
Values in parentheses on the same row as the trait labels represent the lowest, –1 SD, median, +1 SD, and maximum scores on each
measure. Min. = minimum of the scale or minimum observed scores, Mid. = scale midpoint, Max. maximum of the scale or maximum
observed scores.

average, twice as sarcastic as those who are maximally agreeable on the BFI (who express
sarcasm in 2.14% of conversations). Those at the midpoint of the Narcissistic Personality
Inventory bragged during 1.46% of their conversations on average. Each 1-unit increase in
narcissism (on a 0–10 scale) translated into a predicted 0.10% increase in bragging, and those
who had narcissism scores 1 SD above or below the mean bragged during 1.1% vs. 1.45% of

conversations on average, respectively. As another example, each 1-unit increase in life
satisfaction predicted a 0.38% decrease in the number of conversations in which a person
complained, and participants with life satisfaction scores 1 SD above or below the mean
complained during 8.17% vs. 9.72% of their conversations on average, respectively. Finally, in
this sample, those who were rated by their friends as being the most vs. least funny people did
something funny during 12.28% vs. 6.78% of their conversations, respectively. These results
bring trait–behavior correlations to life by translating scores on otherwise arbitrary metrics into
concrete behavioral frequencies.
Discussion
The goal of this chapter was to undertake metric calibration in order to paint a more
precise behavioral portrait of different scores on several personality trait measures. Whereas
zero-order correlations can tell us that agreeable people tend to be less condescending (r = –.14),
less sarcastic (r = –.13), and less funny (r = –.13), metric calibration can translate these
correlations into more readily-interpretable behavioral frequencies that correspond to different
agreeableness scores. For example, using this process, I showed that maximally disagreeable vs.
maximally agreeable people (on the BFI measure) were predicted to be condescending in 3.74%
vs. 1.44% of their conversations, sarcastic in 4.35% vs. 2.14% of their conversations, and funny
in 14.45% vs. 9.35% of their conversations (on average). This provides much more information
about how dramatic or modest the behavioral differences between the most or least agreeable
people (according to a specific scale) are. Thus, these results illustrate the potential for metric
calibration to imbue arbitrary metrics with more meaning by clarifying the tangible interpersonal
behavioral implications of high and low scores on otherwise arbitrary metrics.
11 4
However, these results should be interpreted with the following limitations in mind. First,
the correlations tended to be small, which means that there is a lot of behavioral variability
variability is to some extent inherent in the probabilistic nature of predicting behaviors from
traits. Measurement error due to the tendency for people to interpret and respond to arbitrary
scales in different ways (e.g., acquiescence and extreme response biases) further contributes to
such variability. Thus, metric calibration is well-suited for revealing the behavioral implications
of different scores on average, but less well-suited for predicting the behavior of a specific
person, at least when using nomothetic (vs. person-specific) models.
In addition, even these noisily estimated behavioral frequencies are merely point
difference in the percentage of boastful conversations between those who have the maximum vs.
minimum scores on the BFI extraversion measure could be as large as 1.7% (if b = 0.17) or as
small as 0.07% (if b = 0.01). Larger sample sizes would be required to achieve more precise
estimates of average behavioral frequencies for each scale point.
A further limitation is that the estimated frequencies may be specific to North American
college students, or even this sample. Thus, these frequencies should not be interpreted too
literally as being definitive and generalizable estimates of the behavioral implications of specific
scores on various traits. Finally, as described in Chapter 5, these correlates were discovered
using an exploratory procedure that involved computing 234 correlations between traits and
individual behaviors (or 286 correlations if we include correlations with the behavioral
composites), of which only the negative association between life satisfaction and expressions of
insecurity survived a FDR correction. Thus, these associations await future replication.

Chapter 7: General Discussion
People are defined in large part by how they relate to and interact with others. Yet,
relatively little research has examined what people actually do to each other during their
everyday social interactions. The goal of this dissertation was to bridge this gap and provide an
in-depth, exploratory, and descriptive investigation of individual differences in 18 interpersonal
behaviors (pessimism, criticism, complaining, condescension, blame, sympathy, optimism,
helping, praise, bragging, sarcasm, teasing, negative gossip, neutral or positive gossip, insecurity,
results.
Overview of the Findings
Factor analytic methods have been central to discovering the structure of personality
traits by uncovering latent factors that can explain variation in individual items on self-report
measures (Ashton et al., 2004; John et al., 2008). Chapter 3 explored the factor structure of 18
interpersonal behaviors with two purposes in mind. The first purpose was to derive broader
behavioral composites to complement analyses of individual behaviors. The second purpose was
to generate hypotheses about the more general underlying tendencies that specific interpersonal
behaviors might share. I found that 14 of the behaviors might reflect broader tendencies towards
negativity (pessimism, criticism, complaining, condescension, and blame), supportiveness
(sympathy, optimism, helping, and praise), mockery (bragging, sarcasm, and teasing), and gossip
(negative gossip and neutral or positive gossip). Although these composites were reasonably
reliable, the CFA model did not fit well and subsequent analyses in Chapters 4 and 5 provided
little evidence for the validity and utility of these composites.

The purpose of Chapter 4 was to estimate the rank-order stability of these interpersonal
behaviors across one year. This addresses one of the most central issues in personality
psychology—behavioral consistency—by testing the extent to which a person’s interpersonal
behavior across one week predicts how they behave one year later. Across the set of 18
behaviors, the average rank-order stability was low (r = .13), but 7 behaviors (condescension,
helping, sarcasm, teasing, negative gossip, neutral or positive gossip, apologizing) and the
mockery and gossip factors showed moderate and detectable levels of stability in the range of r =
.18–.28. Whereas rank-order stability analyses of self-report measures abound (Roberts &
DelVecchio, 2000), far fewer studies have examined the rank-order stability of actual behavior
observed in everyday life (cf. Bollich et al., 2016; Harari et al., 2019; Mehl & Pennebaker,
2003). Moreover, to my knowledge, this is the first study to test the rank-order stability of
naturalistically-observed social behaviors across such a long retest period. Thus, these findings
suggest that people show some temporal stability in everyday interpersonal behaviors and shed
further light on the psychometric properties of EAR-coded interpersonal behaviors.
The purpose of Chapter 5 was to explore the correlates and social consequences of
interpersonal behaviors. First, I examined the interpersonal behavioral implications of
personality traits. These analyses revealed some theoretically-consistent correlations, some
unexpected null correlations, and some hypothesis-generating correlations (which I discussed in
Chapter 5 and will further discuss below). Second, I provided a strong test of gender differences
in actual interpersonal behavior. These analyses showed that there were detectable gender
differences in eight interpersonal behaviors and that the average effect size for gender
differences was larger than the average effect size of any given personality trait. Finally, there
11 8
was little evidence that interpersonal behaviors had implications for being seen as likeable, being
liked, and having a good relationship with one’s friends.
Finally, the purpose of Chapter 6 was to demonstrate how behavioral assessment can
reveal the concrete behavioral implications of otherwise arbitrary scores on personality trait
measures. To do so, I undertook metric calibration by mapping specific frequencies of behaviors
onto specific scores on personality trait measures. This process painted more concrete behavioral
portraits of different trait scores by showing, for example, that the least vs. most agreeable
participants in this sample expressed condescension during 3.56% vs. 1.49% of their
conversations on average.
Taken together, these results illustrate the unique value and challenges of assessing
interpersonal behavior in real-world contexts. In the following sections, I discuss the
contributions and challenges of observing actual interpersonal behavior, the complexities of
establishing connections between traits and behaviors, what we have learned about everyday
interpersonal behaviors, and limitations of the current dissertation.
Contributions of Observing Actual Interpersonal Behavior
Throughout this dissertation, I have aimed to illustrate the unique contributions of
capturing actual interpersonal behavior in everyday life. Given that personality traits describe
stable patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, a key purpose of Chapter 5 was to clarify the
behavioral implications of personality traits. This revealed several behavioral correlates that are
consistent with existing conceptualizations of traits. For example, agreeable people were less
sarcastic and condescending, neurotic people tended to express more insecurity, people who
were satisfied with their lives tended to complain less, and funny people (as rated by friends)
tended to tease others more and were funnier in everyday life. In doing so, these results provided
11 9
reassuring evidence of the construct validity and behavioral relevance of self-report measures of
personality traits—a goal that could only be accomplished by measuring actual behavior.
Demonstrating distinct behavioral profiles can also help clarify the distinctions between
conceptually-neighboring constructs. For example, although self-esteem and narcissism are both
characterized by positive self-views, they had distinct detectable behavioral profiles.
Specifically, people who were higher on self-esteem were less likely to express insecurity,
whereas narcissists tended to be more condescending and boastful and more frequently mocked
and teased others. This is consistent with findings that demonstrate that narcissism (unlike
genuine self-esteem) is uniquely associated with aggression and antisocial behaviors (Tracy,
Cheng, Robins, & Trzesniewski, 2009).
A further contribution of measuring actual behavior is that unlike scores on arbitrary
metrics (e.g., a Likert-type scale from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree), behavioral
counts are non-arbitrary. This provides the opportunity to further illuminate the concrete
behavioral implications of otherwise arbitrary scores on personality trait measures. This was the
goal of Chapter 6, which translated the trait–behavior correlations from Chapter 5 into concrete
behavioral frequencies that would be expected for people with different scores on several
personality trait measures. For example, each 10% increase on the Narcissistic Personality
Inventory translated into a predicted 0.10% increase in bragging (as a percentage of everyday
conversations). In doing so, Chapter 6 clarifies what it means to say that someone is highly
narcissistic (vs. low on narcissism), in terms of concrete behavioral differences.
Complexities of Establishing Connections Between Traits and Behaviors
Although the trait–behavior associations that emerged were, for the most part, consistent
with existing conceptualizations of the traits, the effect sizes tended to be small, ranging from
12 0
|.12–.22| for the detectable effects. Several unexpected null effects also emerged. For example,
surprisingly few interpersonal behaviors were detectably associated with agreeableness, even
under a liberal threshold for exploratory effects. There are many plausible and non-mutually-
exclusive explanations for these weak or null correlations, including low coding reliability, lack
of self-knowledge, and the importance of situational factors (which I considered in Chapter 5).
Here, I would like to discuss two additional possibilities: that 1) traits are not straightforwardly
manifested as behavior, but rather as behavior accompanied by the right thoughts and feelings,
and 2) behavioral manifestations of traits are highly context-dependent.
A general limitation of behavioral assessment is that it does not capture the thoughts and
feelings surrounding the behavior, which the self has privileged access to. One possibility is that
the relation between traits and behaviors is more complex—perhaps traits may not be connected
with raw behavior, but instead predict the intentions underlying the behavior and the feelings
associated with the behavior. For example, agreeable and disagreeable people might be equally
helpful, but for different reasons (e.g., genuine care vs. expectations of future reciprocity) and
with different accompanying affective experiences (e.g., warm glow vs. resentment).
To test this idea, future studies could use multi-method approaches that combine
behavioral assessment with self-reports of thoughts and feelings. This approach could also be
used to more generally illuminate the connections between the ABCs of personality in everyday
life (e.g., Sun, Stevenson, Kabbani, Richardson, & Smillie, 2017). For example, what are the
behavioral implications of specific thoughts and feelings? Are thoughts and feelings typically
manifested as behavior, or are they more often behaviorally inert? Is an agreeable person one
who rarely has antagonistic thoughts and feelings about others in the first place, or is
agreeableness better conceptualized as the ability to not express disagreeable thoughts and
12 1
feelings when they occur (Kammrath & Scholer, 2011)? Answers to such questions would clarify
the roles of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in the conceptualization of interpersonal traits.
A second issue is that rather than being unconditional and decontextualized (McAdams &
Pals, 2006), traits might require appropriate eliciting stimuli in order to be manifested in
behavior (Allport, 1937; DeYoung, 2015; Tellegen, 1981). For example, in any given interaction,
not expressing gratitude may either be appropriate (because there was no benefactor) or
indicative of rudeness (if a person failed to express gratitude in response to a favor). Without the
assessment of situational factors, there is no way to distinguish between non-acts that reflect a
lack of relevant eliciting stimuli vs. meaningful omissions. Thus, by averaging across all
interactions without considering context, average levels of gratitude expressions might reflect a
combination of dispositional tendencies as well as the frequency with which a person is in a
situation in which expressing gratitude would be appropriate. This might explain some of the low
correlations between traits and interpersonal behaviors.
Similarly, the correlations between interpersonal behaviors and friend-reported social
consequences might have been stronger if the behavioral composites specifically reflected how
the participants treated their informants (rather than their average behavior across all social
interactions). Ideally, a comprehensive study of the connections between traits, behaviors, and
social consequences should assess additional contextual factors such as the identity and
behaviors of the interaction partner, thereby accounting for all three components of the
personality triad (persons, situations, and behavior; Funder, 2006).
What Have We Learned About Interpersonal Behaviors?
Examining trait correlates and social consequences can also provide insight into the
psychological meaning of everyday interpersonal behaviors. For example, the finding that
12 2
teasing was associated with likeability, being liked by one’s friends, relationship quality, and the
trait of being funny suggests that it might be a warm and playful behavior (rather than being
necessarily antagonistic and mean-spirited).
Each behavior also had a distinct profile of trait correlates. For example, it was not the
case that behaviors that loaded onto the same factor (e.g., criticism and blame) had the same trait
correlates. This, along with the limited utility of the behavioral composites of negativity,
supportiveness, mockery, and gossip, suggests that each behavior is conceptually distinct and
that specific behaviors might be a more useful level of analysis (at least compared to the four
behavioral composites examined here).
In some cases, behaviors were associated with multiple traits. For example,
condescension’s negative correlations with agreeableness and informant-reported morality and
positive correlation with narcissism provide convergent evidence for the highly antagonistic
nature of this behavior. In contrast, the presence of multiple trait correlates suggests that the
same behavior might reflect different motives. For example, bragging was positively correlated
with extraversion, narcissism, and satisfaction with life, and negatively correlated with
informant-reported morality. Thus, among other reasons, bragging might stem from power-
seeking motives (in the case of narcissism) or the desire to share one’s satisfaction with life.
Finally, these results point to open questions about the psychological meaning of helping.
Although individual differences in helping showed stability across a one-year retest period,
helping was not detectably correlated with any of the traits that I examined. One possibility is
that “helping” is too broad to be a psychologically useful category. This is because there are
many different styles of supportive actions that can be mapped onto various points of the IPC
(Trobst, 2000). For example, people can help in directive (offering advice while emphasizing
12 3
one’s own competence and superiority), arrogant (taking control, making decisions for the
recipient, and persuading them to change their behavior), nurturant (providing emotional support,
affection, and patience), and engaging (showing enthusiasm, providing useful information, and
expressing concern) ways (Trobst, 2000). Thus, it might be more useful to code specific helpful
actions such as offering advice, offering to listen, providing practical support, persuading
someone to change their behavior, and attempting to regulate someone else’s emotions (Zaki &
Williams, 2013).
Challenges of Measuring Actual Behavior
Despite the efforts of 158 coders across multiple years of coding, very few behaviors
were assessed with adequate reliability (> .50) across both years (gratitude, apologizing, negative
gossip), and coders found it particularly challenging to judge which participants more frequently
expressed sympathy, optimism, and pessimism. Even with an average of three coders per
participant, reliabilities for sympathy, optimism, sarcasm, bragging, condescension, blame,
pessimism, teasing, and insecurity were < .50 in Year 1 and even lower in Year 2. Whereas the
reasonable pattern of trait correlates for complaining, sarcasm, bragging, condescension, teasing,
insecurity, and being funny suggests that these codings still had some validity, I interpret the
relative lack of trait correlates for pessimism, sympathy, optimism, helping, criticism, and blame
as suggesting that these codings contained little valid variance. The low inter-coder reliability of
several of the interpersonal behaviors complicates the interpretation of the effect sizes and null
results for the rank-order stability and substantive analyses.
This illustrates a major challenge of measuring interpersonal behavior in the real world,
and specifically the kinds of interpersonal behaviors that require more subjective judgments but
are arguably more interesting than micro-level behaviors such as whether or not the participant
12 4
talked or not. These results provide a sense of which behaviors can be reliably and validly
assessed using behavioral observation methods such as the EAR, and the number of coders and
observations that are required to achieve even modest levels of reliability. Given the low base
rates of these interpersonal behaviors, an even greater number of days (e.g., two weeks) might be
needed to reliably estimate between-person differences. Future research should also explore
whether there are ways to improve the reliability of these kinds of behavioral codings (e.g., more
precise definitions and intensive training).
Limitations
I have already discussed two issues that I cannot address with the current data: the
possibilities that rather than straightforwardly predicting average behavior, traits might a) predict
the thoughts and feelings that accompany behavior and b) only predict behavior in the presence
of relevant eliciting stimuli. I have also discussed the fact that low inter-coder reliabilities
complicate the interpretation of null results. A further limitation is that despite assessing a fairly
large number of behaviors, the coding scheme was not systematically designed to
comprehensively capture all interpersonal behaviors that might be of interest. There are many
other potentially audible, frequent, and interesting interpersonal behaviors that were not
measured in this study (e.g., expressing enthusiasm, affection, arguing, giving in, forgiving,
making demands, asserting oneself, asking for help or advice, flirting), as well as many other
interpersonal behaviors that would be difficult to assess using the EAR (e.g., lying, cheating,
being manipulative). Some octants of the IPC were better represented (arrogant–calculating,
cold-hearted, and aloof–introverted) than others (assured–dominant, unassured–submissive,
unassuming–ingenuous) in the current scheme. An ideal coding scheme would include behaviors
12 5
that correspond to each octant of the IPC and each facet of major interpersonal traits such as
extraversion, agreeableness, and honesty-humility.
I also chose to limit the scope of this dissertation to only consider the percentage of
conversations in which each interpersonal behavior was expressed. This approach ensured that
differences in interpersonal behaviors were not merely due to differences in the number of
conversations that participants engaged in. A complementary approach would have been to
consider the percentage of all waking files in which each interpersonal behavior was expressed.
This would provide a better sense of the absolute frequency with which people engaged in each
interpersonal behavior. After all, people do not merely find themselves in conversations; people
can also proactively initiate conversations for the sole purpose of gossiping, criticizing others, or
expressing sympathy. For example, a person who helps during a smaller percentage of their
conversations might still be more frequently helpful on an absolute metric than a person who
helps during a larger percentage of their conversations but rarely engages in conversations in the
first place. Thus, the conclusions in this dissertation are constrained to operationalizations of
average interpersonal behavior as a percentage of everyday conversations.
Finally, I took an exploratory, hypothesis-generating (rather than a confirmatory,
hypothesis-driven) approach in this dissertation. I ran a very large number of analyses (e.g., 286
correlations between personality traits and interpersonal behaviors), and very few survived a
FDR correction. Although randomization tests provided support for the broad conclusions that
personality traits are associated with interpersonal behavior and that there are gender differences
in interpersonal behavior, these analyses do not speak to which specific associations are robust.
Moreover, the conclusions in this dissertation are based on one sample of young adults at a
private, selective North American university. This limits my ability to generalize the current
12 6
findings to other age groups and especially to non-Western cultures. Thus, interesting patterns
that emerge from this dissertation should be treated as hypotheses that await tests of replication
and generalizability, rather than robust findings.
Conclusion
Personality is far from personal. Instead, some of the most important individual
differences are those that describe what people do to each other. A scientific understanding of
personality would thus be incomplete without understanding individual differences in
interpersonal behaviors. This dissertation represents an effort to integrate personality and social
psychology by painting several behavioral portraits of personality traits and exploring the social
consequences of everyday interpersonal behavior. In doing so, this dissertation expands current
understandings of personality traits and everyday interpersonal behaviors and illustrates the
unique value and challenges of measuring actual behavior.
