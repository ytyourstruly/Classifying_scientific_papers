Benefitting from trial spacing
Abstract
26 The statistical relation between two events influences the perception of how one event
27 relates to the presence or absence of another. Interestingly, the simultaneous absence of both
28 events, just like their mutual occurrence, is relevant for describing their contingency. In three
29 experiments, we explored the relevance of co-absent events by varying the duration and
30 frequency of trials without stimuli. We used a rapid trial streaming procedure, and found that the
31 perceived association between events is enhanced with increasing frequency of co-absent events
32 unlike the duration of co-absent events which had little effect. These findings suggest ways in
33 which the benefits of trial spacing, during which both events are absent, could be obtained
34 without increasing total training time. Centrally, this can be done by frequent repeating of
35 shortened co-absent events, each marked by a trial contextual cue. We discuss four potential
36 accounts of how co-absent experience might be processed contributing to this effect: i)
37 contingency sensitivity, ii) testing effect, iii) reduced associative interference by the context, and
38 iv) reduced encoding interference.

Introduction
43 Learning the contingency between two stimuli, or a stimulus and a response, is a
44 fundamental form of learning (Baker, Murphy, & Vallée-Tourangeau, 1996), involving
45 perceiving, remembering, and learning the correlation between events. Such statistical relations
46 can be positive, in which people learn that the presence of one event predicts another (bacon is a
47 useful predictor of eggs as they are positively correlated in some people’s breakfast experience),
48 but predictive relations can be negative, where the presence of one event signals the absence of
49 another (toothpaste and wine, blessedly, tend to be experiences that are negatively correlated).
50 While the simultaneous presence of events is clearly relevant for learning a positive relation, and
51 the occurrence of either event alone is relevant for negative correlations, the mutual co-absence
52 of both events is less intuitively relevant for either type of correlation. However, the absence of
53 events is not the absence of information. For example, in determining the cause of stress-related
54 headaches, the absence of stress and headaches might be informative for inferring the relation
55 between stress and headaches (Murphy, Byrom, & Msetfi, 2017). But, how do absences become
56 relevant and inform particular predictive relations? Moreover, tasks that assess human reasoning
57 find that information about absence is difficult to process and use, suggesting an underlying bias
58 against processing these type of experiences. Here, we investigate how manipulating the
59 frequency and duration of co-absent events impacts judgements of perceived association between
60 pairs of stimuli, in other words, how can experience with “nothing” impact judgements about
61 “something”.
62 To consider how contingent relations are formed, it is worth considering the two well-
63 established empirical factors for establishing the perception of a relationship between two stimuli
64 (e.g., S1 and S2) which are: (1) the temporal and spatial contiguity, and (2) the statistical
Benefitting from trial spacing
65 dependency or contingency which defines a correlative relationship. The first factor has been
66 identified to be necessary, if not sufficient, for associative learning and memory co-activation
67 (Miller & Barnet, 1993; for a review, see Savastano & Miller, 1998); a stimulus will become
68 associated with other stimuli and be able to retrieve that stimulus if presented in the same
69 moment in time and space (Molet, Jozefowiez & Miller, 2010). This idea has been formalised in
70 the Sometimes-Competing Retrieval model (SOCR; Stout & Miller, 2007). The second factor is
71 contingency, a descriptor of the correlation between the two events. When two stimuli are
72 positively contingent, there is a greater likelihood of observing S1 and S2 together (i.e.,
73 conjunction or co-occurrence) and absent together (i.e., co-absence). Seeing only one stimulus
74 without the other characterizes negative contingencies (i.e., disjunction). Contingency has been
75 formalised by ∆p (delta p; Allan, 1980), the one-way relation between two binary dichotomous
76 variables. ∆p has been widely used as an empirical model of learning and as a proxy for causal
77 sensitivity (Baker, Murphy, Mehta, & Baetu, 2005; Baker, Mercier, Vallée-Tourangeau, Frank,
78 & Pan, 1993; Dickinson, & Shanks, 1987; Dickinson, Shanks, & Evenden, 1984; Vallée-
79 Tourangeau, Murphy, & Baker, 2005).
81 difference in the conditional probability of the presence of S2 (the shoe) given the presence of S1
82 (the geometric shape) [p(S2|S1)], and the presence of S2 given the absence (~) of S1 [p(S2|~S1)].
83 When there is no relation between the two events, that is, ∆p = 0, S1 provides no information
84 about the occurrence of S2. However, if ∆p > 0, the presentation of S1 signals an increase in the
85 likelihood of S2 relative to the baseline occurrence of S2, and if ∆p < 0, the presence of S1
86 indicates a decrease in the likelihood of S2 relative to the baseline occurrence of S2.

92 of the first two trials in one condition. The stimuli in each trial were presented on the left
93 and right of the fixation cross, alternating in consecutive trials to explicitly mark different
94 trials. Black squares or trial markers (TM) were used to mark trials and their context.
95 Contingency measure. Delta p (∆p) is a measure of continency (Allan, 1980) defined by
96 the difference in conditional probabilities representing the four event types.
Benefitting from trial spacing
99 number of occurrences of S1 alone (B trials), the number of occurrences of S2 alone (C trials),
100 and the number of co-absences of S1 and S2 (D trials) combine to provide a metric of
101 contingency. Perhaps not surprisingly, increasing the number of times the two stimuli are paired
102 together (A trials), everything else being equal, increases judgments of a positive relation (e.g.,
103 Murphy et al., 2011). Perhaps less intuitively, according to ∆p, increasing the number of times
104 that both stimuli are absent together (D trials) should also increase their contingency and by
105 extension perceived association. In contrast, presenting either event alone (B or C trials), is
106 consistent with a negative contingency, and a decrease in the perceived association.
107 Previous experiments have shown that the four types of events are not equally effective in
108 changing people’s judgments (e.g., Murphy, Witnauer, Castiello, Tsvetkov, Li, Alcaide, &
109 Miller, 2021). Particularly, a form of D trial neglect has been found, such that participants tend to
110 give weight to the events in the following manner: A > B ≈ C > D (Wasserman, Elek, Chatlosh,
111 & Baker, 1993). This selectivity for positive evidence has also been found in other behavioural
112 and cognitive tasks in which participants show sensitivity to the relevance of all types of
113 information but regularly demonstrate a bias towards confirmatory evidence and away from so
114 called negative evidence (Wason, 1968).
115 In behavioural tasks, the absence of a stimulus is less effective for learning than its
116 presence in humans (Mata, Garcia-Marques, Ferreira, & Mendonça, 2015), birds (Nieder,
117 Wagener, & Rinnert, 2020), and rats (Sainsbury, 1971). The feature-positive effect (Jenkins &
118 Sainsbury, 1969) demonstrates that learning about the presence of a stimulus (X) for an outcome
119 (+) against a background (Y; i.e., XY+, Y-) is easier than learning that the absence of a stimulus
Benefitting from trial spacing
120 is a signal for an outcome (XY-, Y+; with humans, Newman, Wolff & Hearst, 1980; with rats
121 and pigeons, Bouton & Nelson, 1998; Young & Pearce, 1984, respectively).
122 In other domains, cognitions about evidence show similar biases. For instance, Wason
123 (1968; also see Johnson-Laird & Wason, 1970) demonstrated a reliance on confirmatory
124 evidence in testing rules (e.g., if p then q), in which participants sought evidence to confirm a
125 hypothesis and were less likely to seek disconfirmatory evidence (if ~p then ~q; Sperber, Cara, &
126 Girotto, 2000 although see Fiddick, Cosmides, & Tooby, 2000). Interestingly, paranormal
127 believers are less likely to use absent information than paranormal nonbelievers (Blanco,
128 Barberia, & Matute, 2015). Furthermore, extreme expressions of such biases against
129 disconfirmatory evidence may reflect underlying mental health related or clinical conditions such
130 as schizophrenia (Juarez-Ramos, Rubio, Delpero, Mioni, Stablum, & Gomez-Milan, 2014;
131 Moritz, & Woodward, 2006).
132 In a previous set of experiments using a contingency learning task, in addition to finding
133 a difference in the weighting of the four types of events of a contingency situation, we
134 demonstrated that changes in perceived association were determined by the frequencies of events
135 but not their durations (Murphy et al., 2021). In five experiments Murphy et al. (2021), using the
136 rapid streaming procedure of Crump, Hannah, Allan, and Hord (2007; see also, Maia, Lefèvre, &
137 Jozefowiez, 2018), participants received presentations of two stimuli that were objectively
138 correlated (positively or negatively) or uncorrelated. In all experiments, increasing the frequency
139 but not the duration of A trials increased ratings of a positive association, and increasing the
140 frequency but not duration of B or C trials decreased ratings of a positive association. Increasing
141 the number of trials while simultaneously decreasing their duration had the same effect on
142 learning as increasing the number of trials without reducing trial duration. However, neither
Benefitting from trial spacing
143 increasing the frequency nor the duration of D trials had any discernible effect on the rating of an
144 association between the two events.
145 The present investigation, therefore, attempted to understand the role of mutual absent
146 stimuli in contingency learning by manipulating the frequency and duration of only the trials
147 where ‘nothing’, but the experimental trial context, is presented. Our previous finding was
148 surprising because there is strong evidence that increasing the duration between trials in which
149 no events are present, that is, the intertrial intervals (ITIs), increases the strength of a learned
150 association (e.g., Balsam, Drew, & Gallistel, 2010; Escobar, Arcediano, & Miller, 2002; Harris
151 & Bouton, 2020; Harris, Patterson, & Gharaei, 2015; Msetfi, Murphy & Simpson, 2007; Msetfi,
152 Murphy, Simpson, & Kornbrot, 2005; Urcelay, Wheeler, & Miller, 2009). This concept of
153 spacing of training trials is a well-researched phenomenon in psychology, in which learning
154 improves by increasing the intervals between pairings of associated stimuli (e.g., Gibbon,
155 Church, & Meck, 1984), leading to our expectation that increasing either the frequency or
156 duration of D trials would enhance the perceived association.
157 It is also possible that the failure to detect any effect of frequency or duration of D trials
158 (Murphy et al., 2021) may have been due to the rapid presentation procedure itself and its impact
159 on trial salience or relevance. In the previous experiments, the temporal periods between events
160 were of the order of hundreds of milliseconds. The effect of absent events may differ on this time
161 scale. Presenting a participant with intervals in which no stimuli occur may provide a brief
162 period to reset attention (attentional blink; Ophir, Sherman, & Lamy, 2018). Presenting stimulus-
163 absent periods has been claimed to attenuate subsequent stimulus detection (Nieuwenstein,
164 Potter, Theeuwes, 2009). In addition to the temporal differences, the participant’s expectations of
165 the relevance of an absent stimulus based on the experimental instructions may also play a role.
Benefitting from trial spacing
166 Mata et al. (2015) found that people learn to use the co-absent information when they are
167 instructed with respect to a specific goal, for example, when participants are asked to explain
168 associations to someone else.
169 The present experiments aimed to test how absent information affects judgments of
170 association between stimuli. The potential effect of increasing the frequency or duration of the
171 co-absent information can be approached from at least the following four theoretical
172 perspectives. i) Contingency Sensitivity: D trials are perceived along with the other events and
173 combined with them provide a metric of association, but with the metric biased by the lower
174 weight assigned to the low salience D trials in comparison to the other trial types (Wasserman et
175 al., 1993). In this view, ∆p could either be a process or descriptive model (Cheng, 1997; White,
176 2005). ii) Testing Effect: Performance during a test of association is enhanced if information
177 acquired on earlier A, B, and C training trials is retrieved on later A, B, and C training trials,
178 respectively, provided that the immediately preceding trial of that type is no longer in short-term
179 memory (i.e., retrieval practice; Roediger & Butler, 2011); from this perspective, D trials clear
180 STM of task-relevant trials, so, on next relevant trial, information is retrieved from LTM. iii)
181 Reduced Associative Interference by the Context: In addition to the association presumed to
182 form between the two target stimuli, it is assumed that the trial context becomes associated with
183 two nominal stimuli on A, B and C trials. Theories of association assume that on an A trial for
184 instance, both S1 and S2 become associated, but they also associate with the trial context.
186 trial markers). In this manner, the S1-S2 association being acquired may be subject to
187 interference from the associations that each element has with the context. Theories of association
188 such as the Rescorla-Wagner model (Rescorla & Wagner, 1972) assume that cues compete for
Benefitting from trial spacing
189 association (e.g., Vallee-Tourangeau et al., 1998). Increasing the frequency or duration of D
190 trials would be expected to extinguish the context’s associations with S1 and S2, freeing them up
191 to associate with each other (e.g., Bouton, 1993). iv) Reduced Encoding Interference: Other
192 theories assume that memory for the pairing between any two events takes time to process, and
193 increasing the spacing between each A trial permits more time to process each new trial (Engle,
194 2002; Waugh & Norman, 1965). From this perspective, D trials provide a relatively empty
195 period that acts as a temporary protector of information active in short-term memory (STM)
196 which boosts later long-term memory (LTM) encoding or retrieval of the association (Aust,
197 Haaf, & Stahl, 2019). Notably, these four mechanisms by which the increase of context alone
198 presentation might facilitate learning and memory are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
Experiment 1
200 The objective of Experiment 1 was to assess whether frequency and duration of D trials
201 are involved in perception of association. We manipulated duration and frequency of D trials
202 (co-absent stimuli), and introduced a retention interval between stimulus presentation and
203 testing. The retention manipulation was included because there is some evidence that immediate
204 testing following training is not as sensitive to the benefit of trial spacing as testing following a
205 retention interval (e.g., Smith & Kimball, 2010). Additionally, research has found that retention
206 intervals, just like context changes, reduce retroactive interference (e.g., Rosas, Vila, Lugo, &
207 López, 2001). Therefore, by introducing an interval between training and testing (the retention
208 interval), we may reduce interference among the various trial types in the experiment and
209 perhaps induce a D trial effect. However, it is possible that a retention interval produces an
210 increase in subjective similarity between events; hence, an overall decrease in sensitivity to
211 discriminable contingencies is also possible (King, Jones, Pearlman, Tishman, & Felix, 2002).
Benefitting from trial spacing
212 Previous work using a predictive judgment task with partial reinforcement (only A and B trials)
213 with a longer retention interval (48 hrs) found evidence supporting a primacy effect over a
214 recency effect when there was a retrieval interval, but a recency over primacy effect when there
215 was no retention interval (Stout, Amundson, & Miller, 2005). During the retention interval, we
216 introduced a secondary irrelevant cognitive task to reduce the likelihood that the retention
217 interval was not treated as relevant to the contingency task.
Methods
Participants
220 Forty participants, 26 females and 14 males (age between 18 and 55; M = 21.5, SD =
221 7.76) were recruited and offered course credit or £10.00 for their participation. This research was
222 approved by the Medical Science Interdivisional Research Ethics Committee of University of
223 Oxford; reference number: R60840/RE001. Our participant exclusion criteria were participants
224 who provided the same rating on all conditions (i.e., were not sensitive to the manipulation) or
225 those who did not finish their session for whatever reason; based on these criteria, no participants
226 were excluded.
Design
228 We used a fully within-subjects design which consisted of one practice condition
229 followed by twelve experimental conditions in random order. Six of the experimental conditions
230 had delayed ratings and six had immediate ratings. Each condition consisted of a sequence of
232 involved in creating the overall ∆p contingency between two stimuli (S1 and S2). An example of
Benefitting from trial spacing
234 To manipulate the retention interval, the judgment ratings were made either immediately
235 following training or after a 3-minute retention interval during which participants solved a word
236 search puzzle that was novel for each condition (no participant finished the puzzle within 3
237 minutes). We independently manipulated, by a factor of three, D trial frequency [0 (None), 36
238 (Baseline), 108 (More), and 324 (Many)] and D trial duration [0 ms (None), 450 ms (Baseline),
240 and D trials, all presented for 450 ms, with a ∆p = 0. For all the experimental conditions, the A,
241 B, and C trials had the same frequency and duration, in which they were presented 36 times each
243 trials; ii) baseline, 36 D trials at 450 ms duration; iii) more, 108 D trials at 450 ms; iv) many, 324
244 D trials at 450 ms; v) long, 36 D trials at 1350 ms; and vi) longer, 36 D trials at 4050 ms. There
245 was no conventional ITI in any condition. The only periods of stimulus absence during training
246 were the programmed and marked D trials. This experiment has not been preregistered.

Procedure
250 We used ePrime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA) to programme the task
251 (see Supplementary Materials, for more details). Participants provided informed consent and
252 were asked to turn off their mobile phones. The participants completed the computer task alone
253 in a computer cubicle and followed on-screen instructions.
Benefitting from trial spacing
254 The task involved observing the appearance of two figures, a geometric shape (S1) and a
256 drawings were consistently yoked for all participants, but assignment of yoked pairs to
257 conditions was completely randomized without replacement, independently across participants.
259 alternating position on the screen respective to the fixation cross (e.g., Right-Left-Right-Left,
260 etc.). We did this to distinguish trials and avoid ambiguities arising when two consecutive trials
261 of the same type are presented, which would have made it difficult to differentiate whether there
262 were two of the same type of trial or one longer duration trial. Additionally, using the trial
264 to mark individual trials.
265 For the delay judgment tests with a retention interval, participants were instructed at the
266 end of each condition stream to complete a word search on a sheet of paper until they saw a
267 flashing signal on the monitor which was timed to occur three minutes from the start.
268 Participants stopped the flashing screen by clicking on “continue”, then the testing phase
269 commenced wherein they were instructed to rate on the computer the association of the two
270 stimuli.
271 At the beginning of the experiment, the participant was instructed to provide their age
272 and gender, after which the instructions read:
273 In this experiment, you will be watching numerous series of rapidly presented shapes and
274 drawings. After each series, a question screen will appear and you will be asked to rate the
275 degree of relatedness between the shape and drawing on a scale from -10 to +10. Please keep
276 your eyes on the cross in the center of the screen.
Benefitting from trial spacing
277 A STRONG POSITIVE RATING should be given when the shape and picture are always
278 presented together and when one is absent the other is also absent.
279 A STRONG NEGATIVE RATING should be given when the shape is always presented
280 without the picture and the picture is always presented without the shape.
281 At the end of each training condition, participants were tested by being asked the
282 question below. Responses were made pressing a labelled key in the keyboard, using a Likert
283 scale from -10 to 10 with increases of 1 (i.e., 21 possible responses):
284 Please indicate the degree of relatedness between the [shape (S1) image inserted here] and the
285 [drawing (S2) image inserted here] in the series that you just saw. Use the rating scale below to
286 enter the degree of relatedness:
287 -10 = strongly negatively related
288 0 = not related
289 +10 = strongly positively related
290 Each condition was programmed into four training blocks, with the ∆p for that condition
291 being met within each block; participants were not informed of the transitions between blocks.
292 Within each of the four blocks, the trials were randomized without replacement. Presenting trials
293 by blocks avoided random selection biasing the overall relationship, either at the beginning or
294 end of the condition. Note that manipulating the frequency of D trials influences the ∆p as given
297 experimental conditions, participants experienced a practice condition, which was not used for
298 the analysis. In the practice condition, each trial type was presented 36 times at 450 ms, and the
Benefitting from trial spacing
299 ∆p = 0; thus, it was identical to the baseline condition and post hoc analysis found that the
300 practice condition received similar ratings to the randomly presented baseline condition.
Analysis plan
302 We used linear mixed models (LMM) to analyse the ratings. The Full model included
303 trial frequency, trial duration, and retention interval as regressors; we added condition order as a
304 covariate (as a discrete variable). Given that the experiment is not a full factorial design, we only
305 included the pertinent interactions. Hence, the Full model was [in lmer() R notation]: ratings ~ 1
306 + (frequency + duration) * retention + cond_order + (1 + retention + frequency + duration |
307 participant), where the random intercept effects were participant, and random slope effects were
308 retention, frequency, and duration, resulting in a maximal random effects structure (Barr, Levy,
309 Scheepers, & Tily, 2013). The variable retention was binary, coded as 1 for 3-mins retention and
310 0 for no retention, the frequency and duration variables were coded as the contrast values (see
311 below). We followed two approaches for the analysis, a data-driven and hypothesis-based model
312 comparison approach.
313 In order to find out which regressors were the most relevant from the data-driven
314 approach we used a backward stepwise algorithm (Kuznetsova, Brockhoff, & Christensen 2015).
315 The Full model was fitted for frequency (0, 36, 108, 324) and for duration (0 ms, 450 ms, 1350
316 ms and 4050 ms) using the following contrast -13, -9, -1, and 23 (Schad, Vasishth, Hohenstein,
317 & Kliegl, 2020). After filtering the regressors using the stepwise algorithm, we obtained a Final
318 model. The LMM analysis was performed in R using the function lmer() from the package lme4
319 (Bates, Mächler, Bolker, & Walker, 2015). The stepwise algorithm was implemented by using
320 the function step() from the package lmeTest (Kuznetsova et al., 2015). For the model
321 comparison approach, we first compared the reduced models (no retention, no duration, and no
Benefitting from trial spacing
322 frequency) against the Full model by using a likelihood ratio test [in R: anova([Reduced model],
323 [Full model], test = ”LRT”)]. Then, we compared all possible alternative models with the same
324 random effect structure against each other by using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and
325 Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Finally, in the supplementary materials, we report the
326 Bayes Factor approximation (BF; Wagenmakers, 2007) for all model comparisons. For all null
327 hypothesis significance tests used on the estimates from the full models, we used an α threshold
328 of 0.05.
329 The R scripts code used for statistical analysis, plots, and data files (for the 3
331 “coabsent_stats&plots_v6.R” (instructions provided in a readme file; Castiello, Miller, Witnauer,
332 Alcaide, Fung, Pitliya, Morrissey, & Murphy, 2021). All analysis and visualizations were made
333 using R (R Core Team, 2019). Additional packages used for data processing were reshape2 and
334 dplyr (Wickham, 2007; Wickham, 2019); models effect sizes and exporting to csv used report
335 (Makowski, & Lüdecke, 2019), calculation of Bayes factors used bayestestR (Makowski, Ben-
336 Shachar, & Lüdecke, 2019), and data visualization used ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016), viridis
337 (Garnier, 2018), and ggpubr (Kassambara, 2018).
Results & discussion
339 The ratings in this experiment, in which there was only a single zero contingency (i.e.,
340 uncorrelated) baseline condition, showed a clear effect of D trial frequency, unlike our previous
341 work (Murphy et al., 2021). The mean ratings from each of the 12 conditions are shown in
343 resulted in higher ratings of association between the stimuli even though the explicit pairings (A
344 trials) as well as the B and C trials were held constant across all conditions in both frequency and
Benefitting from trial spacing
346 duration: increasing D trial duration while holding all other trial types constant did not result in a
347 corresponding increase in judgments. It is also clear that the retention interval, included to
348 potentially reduce interference from training on the test, had no effect.
349 Data-driven approach: After the backward stepwise eliminations of regressors, the Final
350 model included only the frequency factor, frequency random slope, and participant random
351 intercept, suggesting that frequency predicted ratings more accurately than retention, duration,
353 and retention, frequency, and duration were random slopes.

363 Model comparison approach: First, we compared the Full model (deviance = 2567.6)
364 against three Reduced models which omitted independent variables. The first Reduced model
365 omitted frequency (deviance = 2573.1), the second duration (deviance = 2571.3), and the last
366 omitted the retention interval (deviance = 2573.7). We found that the Full model was no better
367 than any of the reduced models: χ²(3) = 5.526, p = 0.06; χ²(2) = 3.7, p > 0.05; and χ²(3) = 6.08, p
369 compared them with AIC and BIC. The model with the lowest BIC and AIC values was the one

371 frequency provides a better model. See also comparison of all models using Bayes Factors in
373 In summary, we found that when we increased the frequency of the co-absent events (D
374 trials), participants’ judgments of the association between the two stimuli increased. However,
375 this was not the case for the conditions in which we increased the duration of the D trials, nor
376 were judgments impacted when a retention interval was added between the exposures (training)
377 and the test phases.
378 A previous attempt (Murphy et al., 2021, Experiment 1, 3 and 5) failed to find an effect
379 of a D-trial manipulation. In those experiments, participants received a range of randomly
380 presented positive, zero, and negative baseline contingencies at different trial frequency (E1: 9,
381 36, 144; E3: 4, 12, 36; E5: 6, 18, 54) and trial duration values (E1: 200, 800 and 3200 ms; E3:
382 600, 1800, 5400 ms; E5:150, 900 or 5400 ms). It is possible that by including a condition with
383 zero frequency D-events (equivalent to zero duration D-events) here, participants may have been
384 more able to perceive the relatively smaller shifts in contingency achieved by manipulating the
385 frequency of D trials. This would be consistent with the finding that discrimination performance
386 is influenced by the range of comparison stimuli (e.g., Harris, 1952; Matthews & Stewart, 2008).
387 Experiment 2 was motivated by the question of whether it was possible to replicate the effect
388 found in Experiment 1 with a wider range of baseline contingencies.
Experiment 2
390 Experiment 2 sought to i) extend the D trial frequency effect result, found in Experiment
391 1, to positive and negative contingencies at baseline, and ii) replicate the D trial frequency effect
392 with different frequencies at zero contingency at baseline. Given that D trial duration and the
393 retention interval had no appreciable effect in Experiment 1, we only manipulated trial frequency
Benefitting from trial spacing
394 in Experiment 2. We used a different set of frequencies with a lower baseline value in
395 Experiment 2 (i.e., 24) than in Experiment 1 (baseline = 36), doing so permitted us to reduce the
396 overall training time. Using fewer trials seemed justifiable because data from other studies
397 involving the rapid streaming procedure suggested sensitivity to contingency with fewer trials
398 than the number of trials used in Experiment 1 (e.g., Maia et al., 2018). Thus, we hypothesised
399 that by reducing the total number of trials but maintaining the three-fold increase in trials
400 between conditions, we would find a similar effect.
401 In Experiment 2, we presented the different experimental conditions in separate blocks
402 for the three baseline contingencies (negative, zero, and positive) rather than randomizing them
403 in an attempt to reduce variability in ratings. All conditions with the same number of A, B, and C
404 trials (manipulated to create the baseline negative, zero, and positives contingencies) were
405 presented together in blocks, but we randomised the order of the three contingency blocks across
406 participants.
407 We also made two more changes from the procedure of Experiment 1. First, the trial
409 minimise TM-contextual carryover effect that might have increased similarity between
410 conditions, given that trial context influences judgments and behaviour in humans (e.g., Msetfi,
411 Wade, & Murphy, 2013; Soares, Polack, & Miller, 2016), as well as expression of learning by
412 nonhumans (Jozefowiez, Witnauer, & Miller, 2012; Murphy, Baker, & Fouquet, 2001; Urcelay,
413 Witnauer, & Miller, 2012; for a review see also Urcelay & Miller, 2014). Second, we added a
414 secondary discrete context stimulus unique for each condition (Murphy & Baker, 2004; Vallée-
415 Tourangeau, Murphy, Drew & Baker, 1998; Waugh & Norman, 1965).

Methods
Participants
418 Forty-five participants, 24 females and 21 males (age between 19 and 38, M = 20.4, SD =
419 2.82), volunteered for this experiment. The experiments were conducted in an open laboratory
420 space, where multiple participants were tested at the same time. We used the same exclusion
421 criterion as Experiment 1 and excluded no participants. This research was approved by the
422 Medical Science Interdivisional Research Ethics Committee of University of Oxford; reference
423 number: R60840/RE001.
Design
425 The experimental design consisted of twelve conditions (plus one practice condition; total
427 generated blocks of conditions by contingencies based on the assumption that one potential
428 factor that promoted the D trial effect in Experiment 1 was that participants may have been more
429 attentive to events of low salience (i.e., D trials) when other types of trials did not vary across
430 adjacent conditions. The order of contingency stages (negative, zero, and positive) was randomly
431 assigned, and within a contingency stage the four frequency conditions were randomized.
432 In Experiment 1, we had used the same visual border (trial marker; TM) around the
433 stimuli or absence of stimuli for each condition. Here we varied the TM in each condition
434 (different border textures) and included a further discrete stimulus (a Greek letter that was unique
436 S1).
437 For each of the three baseline contingencies (negative, zero, and positive), we performed
438 the same manipulation of the four D frequencies: 0 (None), 24 (Baseline), 72 (More), and 216
Benefitting from trial spacing
439 (Many). The baseline D trial frequency for every contingency was 24. Negative contingencies
440 included 4 A trials and 44 B trials; zero contingencies included 24 A and 24 B trials, and positive
441 contingencies included 44 A trials and 4 B trials, with all three contingency types including 24 C
442 trials. These numbers resulted in the negative baseline contingency having a ∆p = [4/(4+44)]-
443 [24/(24+24)] ≈ -0.42; zero baseline contingency having a ∆p = [24/(24+24)]-[24/(24+24)] = 0,
444 and positive baseline contingency having a ∆p = [44/(44+4)]-[24/(24+24)] ≈ +0.42 (see ∆p
446 negative baseline contingency with 72 D trials) was presented in four blocks, each one with 1 A
447 trial, 11 B trials, 6 C trials, and 18 D trials; so the calculated ∆p for this block was the same as
448 the overall contingency (i.e., 1/(1+11) - 6/(6+18) ≈ -0.17). To minimize potential trial order
449 effects within conditions, the trials within all conditions were presented in three blocks, with the
450 ∆p for that condition being met in each block. The four trial types were always 450 ms in
451 duration. As in Experiment 1, there was no ITI other than the D trials. The practice condition was
452 a replication of the baseline condition with a zero contingency, with 24 A, 24 B, 24 C, and 24 D
453 trials. This experiment has not been preregistered.

Procedure
458 Participants provided informed consent before receiving instructions for the task. An
459 adapted program (ePrime 2.0; Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA) with the same
460 instructions as those provided in Experiment 1 was used (see Experiment 1 and the
461 Supplementary Materials for more details concerning the task).
Analysis plan
463 For the statistical analysis we used the same program, packages, functions, and α
464 threshold as Experiment 1. The Full model was [in lmer() R notation]: ratings ~ 1 + frequency *
465 contingency + contingency order + (1 + frequency + contingency | participant), where
466 participant was a random intercept and frequency and contingency were random slopes. We used
467 the same contrasts as in Experiment 1. The data-driven approach was the same as in Experiment
468 1, that is, we applied a stepwise to the Full model. For the model comparison approach, we
469 compared the Full model against a Reduced model without frequency as an independent variable.
470 Using AIC and BIC, we then compare all possible alternative models, including the Null model
Benefitting from trial spacing
471 [rating ~ 1 + stage_order + (1 + frequency + contingency | subject)]. To explore the interaction
472 frequency * contingency, we assessed three more models, one per contingency stage, that is,
473 negative, zero, or positive data sets. All models included contingency stage order as a covariate.
Results & discussion
475 Consistent with the findings of Experiment 1 we found a significant D trial frequency
477 contingency as D trials frequency was increased. In addition, we found that the frequency effect
478 interacted with contingency, with the negative contingency having a larger D trial frequency

495 the Full model against all other alternative models, the former model performed better with

505 Consistent with Experiment 1, in Experiment 2 increasing the frequency of the co-absent
506 events (i.e., D trials) enhanced the perceived association between the two stimuli. In addition,
Benefitting from trial spacing
507 this effect of D-trial frequency was extended from zero-baseline contingencies (Experiment 1) to
508 positive- and negative-baseline contingencies (Experiment 2). If frequency is more effective than
509 duration, then it is possible to ask whether the observed effect of frequency might be due in part
510 to a masked effect of duration since increasing the trial frequency also increases the overall
511 duration of D trial exposure. That is, our results of frequency may be partially a product of
512 duration. One way of answering this question is to see whether the effect of increasing frequency
513 is still present if we reduce trial duration proportionately.
514 In Experiment 3, we inversely adjusted D trial duration as D trial frequency was altered.
515 By so doing, we maintained the overall D trial exposure time constant across conditions.
516 Therefore, in Experiment 3 we included conditions with more but shorter D trials and conditions
517 with fewer but longer D trials. On the basis of the assumptions of ∆p or our associative
518 mechanism, we predicted that more D trials would contribute to enhanced perception of
519 association even if the total exposure duration was shorter.
Methods
Participants
522 Forty participants, 27 females and 13 males (age between 18 and 55, M = 27.37, SD =
523 8.84), served in the experiment. The participants were paid £10.00 at the completion of the
524 experiment. No participants were excluded using the exclusion criterion of Experiment 1. We
525 used the same exclusion criterion as Experiment 1 and excluded no participants. This research
526 was approved by the Medical Science Interdivisional Research Ethics Committee of University
527 of Oxford; reference number: R60840/RE001.

Design
529 The experimental design consisted of 24 conditions, plus a practice condition which was
530 not used for the analysis. We tested the D frequency effect with respect to three baseline
532 all 24 conditions. The manipulations were: i) four D frequencies (0, 8, 24, and 72) with the
533 constant duration (450 ms), ii) four D durations (0, 150, 450, and 1350 ms) with the same
534 frequency (24), and iii) two D frequency x duration inverse varied conditions: a frequency of 8
535 trials of 1350 ms, and a frequency of 72 trials of 150 ms; for each of the three baseline

543 24 B trials, and finally, positive contingencies, 44 A trials and 4 B trials with all three

545 contingency having a ∆p = [4/(4+44)]-[24/(24+24)] ≈ -0.42; zero baseline contingency having a

Procedure
556 We used the same procedure as in Experiment 2. See Supplementary Materials for more
557 details.
Analysis plan
559 For this statistical analysis, we used the same program, packages, functions, and α
560 threshold as in Experiments 1 and 2. The Full model involved: rating ~ frequency + contingency
561 + adjusted_duration + all the interactions + contingency_order + (1 + frequency + contingency
562 | participant). Participants had a random intercept effect and contingencies and frequency were
563 the random slope effects; and as a covariate we included the contingency stage order. The same
564 contrasts were used, and the same data-driven approach was used as in Experiments 1 and 2.
565 Given that our main hypothesis was related to the effect of adjusting the total D trial time (i.e.,
566 inversely varying duration) and its effect on the frequency effect, the model comparison
567 approach was oriented to test a Reduced model without the ‘adjusted by duration’ factor against
568 the Full model. In order to have the ‘frequency adjusted by duration’ as a complete design factor,
569 we duplicated the 0 frequency condition data, so adjusted and non-adjusted at 0 frequency were
570 the same. Because repeating the same condition may bias the analysis by undermining the
571 assumptions of independent observations and variability, we performed a sensitivity analysis
572 with the zero frequency conditions removed. The pattern of results was similar with both

599 Model comparison approach: To explore the effect in more detail and determine whether
600 matching the total D duration was a relevant explanatory factor, we compared the Full model
601 (deviance = 5641.6) against the Reduced model without the adjusted-by-duration factor
602 (deviance = 5641.9), we found a nonsignificant difference in likelihood ratio test, χ²(4) = 0.29, p
603 > 0.05. This suggests that adjusting by duration did not increase the goodness of fit. In addition,
604 using the BIC and AIC, we compared all possible alternative models, including the Null model
606 was the one that includes frequency, contingency, and their interaction, with a BIC = 5725.7 and
607 an AIC = 5665.9; where the Full model (which included adjusted by duration) had larger BIC =
Benefitting from trial spacing
609 S3). This suggests that frequency, rather than duration, explains the differences in ratings across
610 conditions. We reported a similar effect for frequency over duration for A, B, and C trials in our
611 previous work (Murphy et al., 2021).
612 In summary, participant’s contingency judgments increased with more co-absent trials.
613 Even when we inversely varied overall D trial duration with respect to D trial frequency,
614 participants were similarly influenced by the frequency and not the duration. With this third
615 experiment, we showed that it is possible to enhance the perceived association between two
616 stimuli without the explicit pairing of the stimuli (A trials), just by adding trials with the mutual
617 absence of the target events in the training context (trial markers). In addition, this result
618 complements previous findings (Murphy et al., 2021) in which we found that learning the
619 objective contingency can be altered by increasing the frequencies of A, B, or C events, that is,
620 trial events with actual stimuli contained within them, even while proportionately decreasing the
621 durations of A, B, or C trials. In those studies, we found there was a benefit for perceiving a
622 contingency from increasing frequency even with a proportionally shorter overall duration of A,
623 B, or C trials. Here, we found a similar effect for the D trials, in Experiment 3 although we did
624 not investigate whether we could actually shorten (as opposed to holding constant) the overall
625 training session length and still observe a benefit. This result is surprising given a general
626 experimental assumption in psychology that the effectiveness of a learning trial is influenced
627 both by experience with that trial and duration of exposure (e.g., Lattal, 1999; Pashler, Rohrer,
628 Cepeda, & Carpender, 2007).

Meta-analysis
630 A summary comparison of the data pooled from Experiments 1 and 3 (80 participants and
631 1440 ratings) was conducted. It supports the conclusion that frequency and a frequency-based
632 metric of contingency provides a better fit than one involving duration. The first metric, ∆p was

638 occurred, here we took the natural logarithm of the rates ratio [i.e., ln(λ /λ )] between the rate

General Discussion
663 These experiments explored the effect of presenting trials without stimuli on learning an
664 association between two absent target stimuli. We demonstrated the surprising result that
665 frequency of repeated absent event trials is more predictive of performance than overall duration
666 of those trials. Experiment 1 found an effect of D trial (co-absent stimuli) frequency, but not D
667 trial duration, on judgments of a single type of contingency (zero contingency: no correlation
668 between the two stimuli). Increasing D-trial frequency enhanced the perceived relation between
669 the two stimuli. This result is consistent with an account for contingency learning in which both
670 the presentation of the two target stimuli and their absence increases their perceived association
671 (Allan, 1980). The result is also consistent with an increase in response criterion as defined in
672 signal detection theory (SDT), however SDT discriminability does not describe correctly our
674 of D trial duration nor the introduction of a 3-min delay (retention interval) between learning and
675 judgments resulted in any change in the expression of the learned relationship. Experiment 2
676 extended the findings to positive and negative baseline contingencies, where the trial frequency
677 effect was replicated. Experiment 3 provided a control for overall D trial duration that corrected
678 for increases in D trial frequency potentially having a corresponding effect on overall duration.
679 Here, the D trial frequency effect was found to be independent of changes in overall D trial
680 duration. The consistent result of the three experiments is that increasing the frequency of co-
681 absent stimuli (D trials) enhances the perceived association between the two stimuli.
Benefitting from trial spacing
682 The enhanced perceived association produced by D trials may be understood as an
683 increase in contingency discriminability (d’). Applying SDT to contingency judgments results
684 (Allan, Hannah, Crump, & Siegel, 2008; Perales et al., 2005; Siegel et al., 2009), participants are
685 assumed to use experience with the trial types to detect positive or negative contingencies. In the
686 case of negative contingencies, increasing the D-trial frequency should have little effect on the
687 proportion of hits [hit / (hit + miss)], but the proportion of false alarms [false alarm / (false alarm
689 A2). The effect of this would be to decrease d’ as the number of co-absent trials increases.
690 Furthermore, in positive contingencies, the proportion of hits should increase and the proportion
691 of false alarms should remain stable, which would lead to an increase in d’ as the number of co-
692 absent trials increase. In summary, and contrary to our results, SDT predicts a decrease in d’ as a
693 function of the number of D trials for negative contingencies (see also Mercier & Parr, 1996).
696 A1) owing to an increase in the proportion of false alarms.
697 Memory theory also explains aspects of the present results. Testing memory for single
698 items, Hintzman (1970) demonstrated that frequency of an item was more relevant for memory
699 performance than the duration of exposure to that item. Those experiments varied frequency and
700 duration of target item exposure and found that total-time affected neither recall nor recognition
701 memory performance, but the frequency of presentation did (see also Hintzman, 2010). In our
702 case, the frequency effect applied to negative, zero and positive baseline contingencies, but was
703 most robust with negative baseline contingencies. Finally, we found that increasing the
704 frequency and reducing the duration of co-absent stimulus trials (maintaining the same overall
Benefitting from trial spacing
705 duration) did not attenuate the effect of D trial frequency. Next, we describe four different
706 accounts for how more or longer absent events, so-called D trials, have been hypothesized to
707 influence contingency ratings: i) contingency sensitivity, ii) testing effect, iii) reduced
708 associative interference by the context, and iv) reduced encoding interference.
709 Contingency Sensitivity. The first account of the trial spacing effect is that the mutual
710 absence of the two stimuli (D trials) is information supportive of the two stimuli being related, as
711 indicated by ∆p. This account may be referred as the process model of ∆p (Cheng, 1997; White,
712 2004). In this framework, learning involves four types of trials and it is the difference in the
713 proportions of the trials in which one event occurs conditional on the other (A/[A+B]) and the
714 proportion of the trials in which one event occurs conditional on the absence of the other
715 (C/[C+D]). Increasing the D trials has the effect of reducing the latter proportion, thereby
716 increasing the objective contingency (e.g., Allan, 1980; Msefti et al., 2005).
717 Testing Effect. The second account is the testing effect which is a boost in test
718 performance as a result of retrieval from LTM on a prior test (Karpicke, & Roediger, 2008). This
719 explanation assumes that ‘irrelevant’ D trial experience (at least partially) clears STM of task-
720 relevant information (i.e., A, B, or C trial) so that on the next relevant trial previously acquired
721 relevant information is retrieved from LTM as opposed to its already being in STM as a result of
722 a recent prior trial. From this perspective, each D trial provide a mask for STM and forces
723 retrieval from LTM on the subsequent trial, which in turn boosts later retrieval from LTM of A-,
724 B-, and C-trial information on later A-, B-, and C-trials, respectively (Aust, Haaf, & Stahl, 2019).
725 This retrieval practice mechanism is the presumed basis of the Testing Effect (e.g., Roediger &
726 Butler, 2011) and may explain our enhanced effect, although the effect does not differentiate
727 between frequency and duration and so does not anticipate our frequency-superiority effect.
Benefitting from trial spacing
728 Associative Interference by the Context. A third account of the trial spacing effect
729 suggests that during each A trial people learn associations between the two presented stimuli,
730 and on B and C trials the stimuli are associated with the trial context, where the trial context is
731 the set of stimuli unique to the experimental situation (e.g., the rectangular frames in the present
732 research). This context becomes associated with both B and C events, and ultimately
733 presentation of the context alone may retrieve memories of the individual stimuli. One
734 consequence of these context associations is that representations of the two stimuli (S1 and S2)
735 in each trial may be retrieved by the context on A trials and interfere with further learning of the
736 target association (Bouton, 1993; Miller & Escobar, 2002). However, to the extent that the
737 context is extinguished during D trials, these associations might weaken and consequently
738 interfere less with A-trial learning. Therefore, increasing the frequency or duration of D trials
739 would be expected to reduce the effect of interference arising from context learning.
740 Reduced Encoding Interference. A fourth account is that including ‘empty’ D events in
741 each training condition increases the opportunity to further process the information from the
742 preceding A, B or C trial before the next one of these trials begins, thereby providing more
743 available cognitive resources and allowing better processing of the content of each trial (Waugh
744 & Norman, 1965). Our rapidly presented stimuli are presumably processed in STM which has
745 limited capacity (Cowan, 2008). Thus, the faster a continuing stream of information enters STM,
746 the less time is available to process each new stimulus event. This is apt to decrease attentional
747 control and hence increase proactive interference (Engle, 2002). The view here is that slowing
748 down the input of information allows participants more time to consolidate the content of each
749 successive trial into LTM (McGaugh, 1966).
Benefitting from trial spacing
750 The trial spacing effect
751 The testing effect and the reduced encoding interference accounts of the trial spacing
752 effect both anticipate that the impacts of A, B, and C trials will be boosted by more D trials, here
753 treated as low cognitive load periods. This means that with more D trials, baseline positive
754 contingencies should have been rated as more positive as was observed, but baseline negative
755 contingencies should have been rated as more negative (see Mercier & Parr, 1996) which is
756 contrary to what we observed. The contingency sensitivity and interference by the training
757 context accounts both fare better in that, regardless of the baseline contingency, increasing the
758 frequency of D trials increases the objective contingency as is evident from the equation ∆p =
759 (A/[A+B]) – (C/[C+D]) and provides more time for extinction of the training context,
760 respectively. However, with the number of C trials fixed across conditions as it was in each of
761 the present experiments, according to the contingency account, variation in the frequency of D
762 trials would be expected to have a similar positive effect on both positive and negative baseline
763 contingencies. Our results revealed a somewhat larger effect with the negative contingencies,
764 supported by the interaction between frequency and contingency in Experiment 2 and 3 (i.e.,
765 increasing the number of D trials increased ratings marginally more when the baseline
766 contingency was negative than when it was positive). Hence, the superiority of the contingency
767 sensitivity account over the other accounts with respect to the present data is qualified. Turning
768 to interference by the context, context-S1 and context-S2 associations might be expected to
769 interfere more with memories of A trials (i.e., S1-S2) than B or C trials. Thus, more D trials (i.e.,
770 more extinction of the context) would be expected in increase contingency ratings with both
771 positive and negative contingencies, as was observed. One might think that extinction would also
772 be enhanced by longer D trials, but considerable prior research has found extinction to depend
Benefitting from trial spacing
773 more on number of extinction trials than the duration of the extinction trials (Harris & Andrews,
774 2017). Consequently, based on the present data alone, the benefit of more D trials seemingly
775 arises from greater opportunity for extinction of relevant associations to the context.
776 Probabilities versus rates
777 It was surprising to us that we did not find an effect of duration on judgments of
778 association given that duration is well known to play a fundamental role in learning (Balsam &
779 Gallistel, 2009; Miller & Barnet, 1993). We briefly summarize three families of learning models
780 which treat time in different ways (for a more detailed review of the first two, see Bonardi,
781 Cheung, Mondragón, & Tam, 2016). First, there are time-accumulation models (e.g., Gallistel &
782 Gibbon, 2000; Gibbon & Balsam, 1981), in which events are accumulated in a period of times
783 (i.e., rates). Second, there are trial-based models (e.g., Rescorla & Wagner, 1972) which do not
784 explicitly code the duration of events; this appears problematic given the often-reported
785 relevance of temporal information as a learning factor in both humans and animals (e.g., Buriticá
786 & Alcalá, 2019; Nasser & Delamater, 2016). However, a number of attempts to integrate timing
787 into the classic trial-based models have been suggested (e.g., Delamater, Desouza, Rivkin, &
788 Derman, 2014; Donahoe, Burgos, & Palmer, 1993; Gershman, 2015; Ghirlanda, Lind, & Enquist,
789 2020; Luzardo, Alonso, & Mondragon, 2017). Third, there are behavioural timing models (e.g.,
790 Killeen & Fetterman, 1988; Machado, 1997), in which an agent’s internal states (behavioural
791 states) serve as events that are associated with moments in the environment at a particular time.
792 Our results support a trial-based approach of learning where trial duration has no clear effect and
793 the critical factor is how many times an event is presented. The difference between multiple trials
794 and a long duration is the repeated change of the state of the cues, from off to on or on to off
795 which may itself support learning. There is evidence that transitions are more informative than
Benefitting from trial spacing
796 steady states (Hintzman, 1970), and that transitions are themselves cues for learning (Murphy,
797 Mondragon & Murphy, 2009).
798 Animal Literature
799 Comparisons between human contingency learning and animal conditioning have been
800 previously suggested to reflect a similar underlying learning process (Baker & Mackintosh,
801 1977; Baker & Mackintosh, 1979; Miller, 1982; Shanks, 1995). While animal behaviour does
802 map onto contingency (Rescorla, 1967; Murphy, & Baker, 2004), there is evidence that supports
803 duration (time) instead of frequency during the acquisition process (e.g., Balsam et al., 2010;
804 Escobar et al., 2002; Gallistel & Papachristos, 2020; Harris & Bouton, 2020; Harris et al., 2015;
805 Urcelay et al., 2009). However, during extinction, the presentation of the CS without the US, CS
806 frequency seems to be more relevant for predicting decreases in conditioned responding (Harris
807 & Andrew, 2017; Chan & Harris, 2019). Some of this research has involved absent events being
808 defined by extended exposure to the constellation of stimuli provided by the context or chamber
809 in which the animals were housed. With the right/left alternation of stimuli and use of frames, we
810 endeavoured to make our trials more discrete and enhance the salience of the D trials to
811 encourage context relevance for learning.
812 Limitations
813 An important point concerning D trials, consistent with Murphy et al.’s (2021) findings
814 concerning A, B, and C trials, is that we found enhanced association ratings even when the
815 increased frequency of D trials was accompanied by a proportionately shorter duration of the D
816 trials. It remains unclear whether this effect would also occur in paradigms that are not built on
817 an explicit frequency basis, as was the case in the present streaming task (Allan et al., 2008). For
818 instance, as previously mentioned, the ∆p formulation has been criticised because of the view
Benefitting from trial spacing
819 that counting of non-occurring events may be problematic given that it is not obvious how
820 participants count the number of times something has not happened (see Gallistel, Craig, &
821 Shahan, 2014), other than by laboratory strategies such as we used here. As an adapted example
822 taken from Gallistel et al. (2014), it is difficult to imagine how many absences of earthquakes in
823 Mexico City have occurred since 2017, but we can perceive the duration of that absence. Other
824 contingency analyses based on information theory exist in which, instead of counting events,
825 participants use the entropy of the distribution of the intervals between cues and outcomes
826 (Ward, Gallistel, & Balsam, 2013). In the present work, trials were explicitly discrete with
827 different sequential topology and every trial was marked, which may have favoured a counting
828 strategy over a strategy of accumulating event durations (rates). In this regard, the present
829 experiments are consistent with much of experimental psychology which often uses a trial-based
830 strategy to assess human performance. Our results contradict a general hypothesis that treats
831 longer stimulus exposure as an increased opportunity to process a stimulus and a decreased
832 opportunity for interference from competing trials. At least with contingency learning, increasing
833 trial duration was less effective than providing more frequent, shorter trial bursts.
834 One might ask whether similar results would have been observed with trials of more
835 conventional duration as opposed to the rapid streaming procedure. Obviously, the present data
836 does not answer that question, although the streaming-trial procedure did diminish the likelihood
837 that our effects are based on counting. However, in one experiment in the Murphy et al. (2021)
838 paper, increasing all trial durations by a factor of three did not alter the greater effect of
839 frequency than duration on A, B, or C trials.
Benefitting from trial spacing
840 Implications
841 One of the most robust phenomena in the learning literature is the trial spacing effect:
842 greater spacing of training trials results in superior performance on test trials (Vlach, &
843 Sandhofer, 2021). In applied situations such as educational and psychotherapeutic settings, one
844 challenge to the spacing of training trials is that spacing training ordinarily increases the total
845 time needed for training. The present findings suggest that frequency of D trials rather than D
846 trial duration is critical for an enhanced perception of association. If we believe that there is a
847 fundamental similarity between trial spacing and co-absent events, this would suggest that the
848 benefit of trial spacing is not due to time per se between training trials, but the number of co-
849 absent events that agent’s perceive between training trials. Hence, more intertrial events (i.e., D
850 trials) can be added without an extra cost in training time by making these events shorter.
851 However, this generalization should be entertained with caution. Given that trial spacing in many
852 other situations is seemingly time dependent and our findings suggest that duration does not
853 plays a critical role, trial spacing and number of co-absent events may act through fundamentally
854 different underlying processes. If this were the case, generalizing our findings to other
855 preparations would be premature.
856 Conclusions
857 Our results support the view that humans use the mutual absence of stimuli (D trials) to
858 guide their judgments of association (i.e., contingency). Furthermore, it is possible to enhance
859 perceived contingencies between two stimuli by increasing the frequency (but not the duration)
860 of D trials, even when these trials have a short duration, a frequency-superiority effect. The
861 results support accounts of the benefit of co-absence events based on (a) participants tracking the
862 Δp contingency, and (b) reduced associative interference with information concerning A trials by
Benefitting from trial spacing
863 the context. These findings have potential applications for boosting learning without additional
864 explicit pairing of stimuli or lengthening of training session.
865 Context
866 One of the most ubiquitous phenomena in Psychology is the trial spacing effect; spaced
867 training trials result in better learning and retention. However, the cost of spacing training trials
868 is that training sessions must be longer or there have to be more training sessions. In contingency
869 learning sessions, trials with no cues or outcomes (D trials), are similar to standard intertrial
870 intervals (ITIs). Different theories have been proposed to explain why human and non-human
871 animals learn better with longer intervals between trials. Although the very term 'intertrial
872 interval' focuses on the duration of the interval, typically the duration of the interval is
873 confounded with seemingly irrelevant events that occur within the ITIs. In the present research,
874 we dissociated ITI duration from inter trial frequency (the ITF), and found that frequency of D
875 trials rather than duration of D trials is what enhances perceived association, at least in
876 contingency learning. Thus, stronger associative learning can be obtained by increasing D trials
877 while making the D trials proportionally shorter.
