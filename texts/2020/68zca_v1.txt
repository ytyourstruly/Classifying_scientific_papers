0.- ABSTRACT
Previous research has sought to explain the rise of right-wing populist leaders in
terms of the evolutionary framework of dominance and prestige. In this framework,
dominance is defined as high social rank acquired via coercion and fear, and prestige is
defined as high social rank acquired via competence and admiration. Previous studies
have shown that right-wing populist leaders are rated as more dominant than non-populist
leaders, and right-wing populist / dominant leaders are favoured in times of economic
uncertainty and intergroup conflict. In this paper we explore and critique this application of
dominance-prestige to politics. First, we argue that the dominance-prestige framework,
originally developed to explain inter-personal relationships within small-scale societies
characterised by face-to-face interaction, does not straightforwardly extend to large-scale
democratic societies which have frequent anonymous interaction and complex ingroup-
outgroup dynamics. Second, we show that economic uncertainty and intergroup conflict
predict not only preference for dominant leaders, but also prestigious leaders. Third, we
show that perceptions of leaders as dominant or prestigious are not fixed, and depend on
the political ideology of the perceiver: people view leaders who share their ideology as
prestigious, and who oppose their ideology as dominant, whether that ideology is liberal
or conservative. Fourth, we show that political ideology is a stronger predictor than
economic uncertainty of preference for Donald Trump vs Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US
Presidential Election, contradicting previous findings that link Trump’s success to
economic uncertainty. We conclude by suggesting that, if economic uncertainty does not
directly affect preferences for right-wing populist leaders, other features of their discourse
such as higher emotionality might explain their success.

1.- INTRODUCTION
The last two decades has seen the rise of several right-wing populist leaders in
democratic countries (Tartar, 2017) such as Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen, Viktor
Órban, Matteo Salvini, Nigel Farage, Narendra Modi, Jair Bolsonaro and Geert
Wilders. According to Mudde and Kaltwasser (2017), populists share a political
discourse that divides society into two antagonistic groups: “pure” people vs the
“corrupt” political, economic, cultural and media elite or establishment. They often
criticise representative liberal democracy and argue that politics should be a direct
expression of the will of the people (e.g., via referenda). Populism is not a complete
ideology in itself, unlike socialism or fascism, but it attaches to other ideologies on the
right or the left (Muddle and Kaltwasser, 2017).
The dual evolutionary model of social hierarchy (Cheng & Tracy, 2014; Cheng,
Tracy, Foulsham, Kingstone, & Henrich, 2013; Henrich & Gil-White, 2001; Jiménez,
Á.& Mesoudi, In preparation; Redhead, Cheng, & O’Gorman, 2018a) has recently
been used to understand the rise of such right-wing populist leaders (Kakkar &
Sivanathan, 2017; McAdams, 2017). This model distinguishes between dominance
and prestige as two independent strategies that people use to acquire high social rank
and influence (Henrich & Gil-White, 2001). The dominance strategy entails the use of
force and coercion against others. Its success depends on the capacity to defeat
and/or induce fear in other individuals (Redhead, Cheng, & O’Gorman, 2018b).
Consequently, people tend to dislike dominant individuals (Brand & Mesoudi, 2019;
Cheng et al., 2013) and avoid proximity to them (Henrich & Gil-White, 2001). In
contrast, the prestige strategy entails the display of competence within valued domains
and/or pro-in-group behaviours. Its success depends on the capacity to induce
admiration and voluntary deference in others because prestigious individuals are
perceived as having instrumental value to accomplish one’s own goals (Leary,
Jongman-Sereno, & Diebels, 2014), such as socially learning valuable
knowledge/skills (Henrich & Gil-White, 2001; Jiménez & Mesoudi, 2019) or being
provided with tangible private (Pinker, 1998, p. 499) and public goods (Price & Van
Vugt, 2014). This explains why people generally like and prefer prestigious individuals
as both leaders and social companions (Cheng et al., 2013; Kruger & Fitzgerald, 2011;
Laustsen & Bor, 2017; Petersen & Laustsen, 2019).
Kakkar and Sivanathan (2017) equated right-wing populist leaders with
dominant political leaders. They argue that certain environmental contexts, in
particular economic uncertainty, might reverse the preference for prestigious
individuals over dominant individuals, at least when choosing between different
political leaders. According to these authors, economic uncertainty induces in people
a sense of lack of personal control, prompting them to find ways to compensate for
that deficit. One of these compensatory strategies is to support dominant political
leaders (Hogg & Adelman, 2013), who are perceived as able to defend the interests
of the in-group even at the expense of the well-being of out-groups (Halevy, Chou,
Cohen, & Livingston, 2012).
Consequently, Kakkar and Sivanathan (2017) attribute the rise of right-wing
populist leaders to the rise in economic uncertainty after the 2008 global financial crisis
(see also Funke, Schularick, & Trebesch, 2016; Funke & Trebesch, 2018). First,
Kakkar and Sivanathan found that, during the 2016 US Presidential campaign,
participants rated the right-wing populist leader Donald Trump significantly higher in
dominance and lower in prestige than the opposing candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Supporting the link to economic uncertainty, Kakkar and Sivanathan further showed
that (i) individual voters’ preference for Donald Trump before the election was
significantly predicted by an aggregate zip-code-based measure of economic
uncertainty composed of housing vacancy rate, poverty rate and unemployment rate,
and (ii) at a country level, using data from the World Values Survey from 2004-2016
(Inglehart et al. 2018) with 138,323 respondents from 69 countries, preference for
dominant leaders in general (a preference for “a strong leader who does not have to
bother with parliament and elections”) was significantly predicted by the change of
unemployment from one year to the next within that country according to the World
Bank.
Theories and findings such as those of Kakkar and Sivanathan (2017) are
valuable in integrating across disciplines (psychology, economics, politics and
anthropology) and providing novel explanations for socially and politically important
trends. However, precisely because of this importance, such claims and evidence
should be carefully evaluated and scrutinised. In this article, we critically evaluate the
above theory and evidence linking right wing populist leaders to dominance via
economic uncertainty. We first discuss the limitations of the current applications of the
dual evolutionary model of social hierarchy to modern politics and the rise of right-wing
populism, arguing for a greater role of political ideology. Second, we formulate a
number of hypotheses derived from the limitations we identify. Third, we test these
hypotheses using data from the WVS as well as the data collected by Kakkar and
Sivanathan (2017) to analyse the perceptions of and preferences for Donald Trump
and Hillary Clinton. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of the broader
literature on prestige-dominance, political psychology and populism.
1.1.- The dual evolutionary model of social hierarchy as applied to politics
Although originally conceived as an explanation for social rank hierarchies
within small, face-to-face groups, the prestige-dominance distinction has also been
applied to the political arena in large-scale societies, as described above for the 2016
US Presidential Election (Kakkar & Sivanathan, 2017; McAdams, 2017; Witkower,
2017). In these applications, Donald Trump is depicted as dominant because of his
more aggressive vocabulary, threats against political rivals (e.g., “lock her up”), non-
verbal displays of dominance (e.g., occupying more space and extending his arms)
(Witkower, 2017) and the display of emotional and personality traits associated with
dominance (Cheng, Tracy, & Henrich, 2010) such as high neuroticism, low
agreeableness and hubristic pride (McAdams, 2017; Nai, Martínez I Coma, & Maier,
2019). Conversely, Hillary Clinton is depicted as prestigious because of her greater
political experience and expertise (e.g., having previously been Secretary of State) as
well as her more frequent demonstrations of knowledge and non-verbal displays
associated with the prestige strategy (e.g., smiling) during the Presidential debates
(Witkower, 2017).
However, the application of the dual evolutionary model of social hierarchy to
modern politics and the rise of right-wing populist leaders is not without difficulties. The
model was initially developed to explain the acquisition of high social rank and social
influence within small groups (e.g., hunter-gatherer bands or sports teams) in which
members interact face-to-face and personally know each other. In contrast, the
acquisition of political power in modern society occurs within large societies (e.g., the
population of the USA exceeds 325 million people) in which members only interact
with and know a small proportion of other members. Consequently, the acquisition and
maintenance of political power and political influence within the modern political
sphere are more complex than within the small groups to which the model was
originally applied.
First, the key distinction between the dominance and prestige strategies in the
dual evolutionary model is that the social influence attained through dominance is
imposed upon others, while the social influence attained through prestige is voluntarily
given by others (de Waal-Andrews, Gregg, & Lammers, 2015; Henrich & Gil-White,
2001). However, democratic procedures like the presidential elections that led to the
victory of Donald Trump are especially tuned to the prestige strategy given that political
power is voluntarily given to the party or coalition of parties that have the greatest
freely-conferred support within a society1. Given the fact that Donald Trump attained
the US Presidency through democratic elections, not through a coup d’état, labelling
his strategy to power “dominance” is questionable.
Second, the dominance and prestige strategies in the original model were
assumed to be displayed towards other members of the in-group, such as other
members of a small-scale society like the !Kung or the Yanomamo (Henrich & Gil-
White, 2001), sport teams (Cheng et al., 2010) and other community groups (Brand &
Mesoudi, 2019). In modern politics, however, the use of both strategies are often
directed towards out-groups, such as when political leaders of one country pursue a
military attack or trade war against another country (potentially a dominance strategy)
or when leaders make reforms in their own country to gain admiration and be emulated
by the international political community (potentially a prestige strategy). However, it is
not clear that the concepts of prestige and dominance straightforwardly translate to
this inter-group context. For example, a dominant action by a political leader directed
towards an out-group (e.g., bombing another country) might lead to the acquisition of
1 In modern democracies, the winners of elections are not always the ones that have the greatest support in
absolute terms. For instance, Hillary Clinton had more votes (48.5%) than Donald Trump (46.4%) in the US
Presidential elections of 2016. Nevertheless, Donald Trump became the President of the US. This is due to the
specific system within a country to turn votes into seats.
prestige among in-group members (e.g., by the demonstration of commitment to
protect the in-group from external threats). When facing intergroup conflict, research
has found that people increase their preferences for male leaders who have traits
associated with the use of the dominance strategy such as facial masculinity, muscle
strength and height (Laustsen & Petersen, 2017; Little, Burriss, Jones, & Roberts,
2007; Petersen & Laustsen, 2019), features that people presumably perceive as
facilitating the use of aggression against outgroups during intergroup conflict
(Laustsen & Petersen, 2017). For instance, Little et al. (2007) found that people prefer
hypothetical election candidates with more physically dominant faces during war time
and less physically dominant faces during peace time. However, this and other studies
have not tested whether inter-group conflict simultaneously increases people’s
preferences for prestigious political leaders. It is plausible that prestigious leaders are
desirable in inter-group conflict because they are more knowledgeable about
international relations, or more skilled negotiators and, therefore, achieve the best
deals possible for their in-group preventing much of the damage of a long-lasting inter-
group conflict.
Furthermore, although members of one’s country might often be perceived as
the ‘in-group’, the existence of different ideologies within a country often leads to
conflicts, and groups with opposing ideologies within the same country become
perceived as out-groups. This has consequences for the perceptions of dominance
and prestige of political leaders and political decisions, as the same decisions might
be seen differently by people within the same country but belonging to different
ideological groups. For instance, the Catalonian Independence Referendum (1st
October 2017) carried out by the pro-independence Catalonia regional government
despite being declared illegal by the Constitutional Court of Spain was considered a
coup d’état (i.e., an act of dominance) by people who defend the territorial integrity of
Spain (e.g., Wintour, 2017), but a democratic process capturing the will of the people
(i.e., a prestigious act) by defenders of the independence of Catalonia (e.g., Asamblea
Nacional Catalana, 2018). Conversely, the application of article 155 of the Spanish
Constitution by the Spanish Government, which resulted in the control of the
Catalonian regional power by the Spanish government, was considered a coup d’état
(i.e., an act of dominance) by people in favour of the independence of Catalonia, but
a reestablishment of democracy (i.e., a prestigious act) by defenders of the territorial
integrity of Spain (e.g., Burgen, 2017).
The same is applicable to the perceptions of liberal (e.g., Hillary Clinton) and
conservative (e.g., Donald Trump)2 political leaders as either dominant or prestigious.
Conservatives might feel that liberal politicians are imposing their views on society by
pushing the direction of cultural change towards liberal values. Similarly, liberals might
feel that conservative politicians are imposing their views on society by pushing the
direction of cultural change towards conservative values. As both conservatives and
liberals see political leaders of the opposing ideology as a threat to their personal
values, or seeking to coerce them into following alternative values, they might perceive
them as dominant. In contrast, political leaders of their own ideology are seen as
defending and trying to implement the values that those people view as correct and,
therefore, people might perceive these politicians as competent and confer prestige
on them. These perceptions of political leaders of their own ideology as prestigious
and political leaders of the opposing ideology as dominant might be exacerbated due

and Democrat and ‘conservative’ as synonymous of right-wing and Republican.
to the increasing political polarization experienced in the last two decades, at least in
the US (Lukianoff & Haidt, 2018, pp. 128-132).
Third, it is not clear why economic uncertainty would reverse the general
tendency of preferring prestigious leaders over dominant leaders as Kakkar and
Sivanathan (2017) propose. Although dominant leaders might benefit their in-group by
competing more aggressively over limited resources against out-groups, prestigious
individuals, who are assumed to be more competent, might take the right decisions to
bring the country out of an economic recession. Therefore, supporting a prestigious
leader might also be a way to compensate the lack of control while facing economic
uncertainty.
Furthermore, it is unclear why economic uncertainty would be a better predictor
of preference for dominant / right-wing populist leaders than political ideology, as has
been claimed (Kakkar & Sivanathan, 2017). Ideology is an alternative explanation for
the rise of right-wing populist leaders. This ideological explanation posits that the
political discourse and proposed policies of right-wing populist leaders are more
attractive for a part of the electorate than the political discourse and policies of well-
establish political leaders. This explanation is often described as a cultural or political
backlash against post-materialist political movements such as feminism and
environmentalism (R. F. Inglehart & Norris, 2016, 2017) and political correctness
(Campbell & Manning, 2018, pp. 151-161). Inglehart and Norris (2017) found support
for the ideological explanation in a study in which they tested whether ideology or
economic uncertainty better accounts for the recent rise of right-wing populism. They
used data from the European Social Survey (2002-2014) to predict voting preferences
for a right-wing populist party from several control (e.g., age, gender, education),
economic (e.g., unemployment, subjective economic uncertainty, living on social
benefits) and ideological (e.g., anti-immigration, right-wing self-identification, mistrust
in global governance) variables. They found mixed support for the economic
uncertainty explanation. For example, right-wing populists were supported more by
unemployed people but less by people receiving social welfare. In contrast, all the
ideological predictors (anti-immigration attitudes, mistrust in global and national
governance, authoritarian values and right-wing ideology) positively predicted support
for populist leaders, giving clear support for the ideological explanation. These results
highlight the importance of political values in predicting support for right-wing populist
leaders. Consequently, we suggest that political ideology actually plays a greater role
than economic uncertainty in explaining the rise in popularity of right-wing populist
leaders. Nevertheless, political ideology and economic uncertainty might interact.
Ideology might predict who decides to vote for a right-wing populist leader, but
economic uncertainty might have created a window of opportunity for right-wing
populists, with their discourse becoming attractive to a greater number of people after
the financial crisis.
In conclusion, there exist certain parallels between right-wing populist leaders
such as Donald Trump and the dominance strategy (e.g., use of aggressive
vocabulary against political rivals). However, there are limitations to this parallel.
Donald Trump and other right-wing populist leaders often use this strategy against
outgroups or political rivals. This differs from the dual evolutionary model of social
hierarchy in which the dominance strategy is directed towards in-group members. The
use of dominance against outgroups might serve to gain prestige within the ingroup,
blurring the original dominance-prestige distinction. Consequently, failing to take the
in-group/out-group distinction into account might lead to incorrect inferences such as
concluding that people prefer dominant political leaders under certain contexts (e.g.,
economic uncertainty) without considering how political ideologies influence
perceptions of dominance and prestige of political leaders (e.g., Kakkar & Sivanathan,
2017) or how dominance strategies against out-groups might confer prestige within in-
groups (Halevy et al., 2012).
1.2.- Hypotheses
specify the conditions under which dominant and prestigious leaders should be
preferred. Hypotheses H1-H3 predict preferences for dominant (H1a, H2a and H3a)
and prestigious (H1a, H2b and H3a) political leaders as a result of experiencing
economic uncertainty (H1), perceived lack of control (H2) and inter-group conflict (H3).
These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. Dominance and prestige have been
shown to be two independent strategies to acquire high social rank and social
influence through different means (Cheng & Tracy, 2014; Cheng et al., 2013).
Consequently, economic uncertainty, perceived lack of control and intergroup conflict
might predict preference for both dominant and prestigious political leaders.
Hypotheses H4-H6 derive from our argument that political ideologies influence
perceptions of political leaders as either dominant or prestigious and the greater
importance that we ascribe to political ideology over economic uncertainty in predicting
voting preferences. These hypotheses are tested in Studies 1 and 2 described below,
which extend and improve on the methods and analyses of previous studies (e.g.,
Kakkar and Sivanathan 2017) that partially address only some of the hypotheses.

Hypotheses H4-H5 refer to how people’s political ideology is related to the perceptions of political leaders as
dominant or prestigious (Study 2). Hypothesis H6 is related to whether political ideology is a better predictor of
voting decisions than economic uncertainty or not.
3 Because the scale used to measure political ideology ranges from conservative (1) to liberal (7), this hypothesis
could also be framed as “conservative ideology is negatively related to perceptions of conservative political
leaders as dominant and positively related to perceptions of liberal leaders as dominant.
4 Because the scale used to measure political ideology ranges from conservative (1) to liberal (7), this hypothesis
could also be framed as “conservative ideology is negatively related to perceptions of liberal political leaders as
prestigious and positively related to perceptions of conservative leaders as prestigious.
2.- STUDY 1
2.1. Introduction
The aim of this study is to test whether economic uncertainty (H1a & H1b),
perceived general lack of control (H2a & H2b) and intergroup conflict (H3a & H3b)
positively predict preferences for dominant and prestigious leaders respectively. We
use data from the longitudinal World Values Survey (henceforth WVS; R. Inglehart et
al., 2018) for the period 2010-2016. H1a and H2a have been previously tested with
this dataset but with a longer timeframe (2004-2016) by Kakkar and Sivanathan
(2017), we are using the data from 2010 to 2016 because only the data from this period
contain all the variables of our interest. Hypotheses H1b, H2b, H3a and H3b (related
to prestige, and intergroup conflict) have not previously been addressed.
Kakkar and Sivanathan used a 4-point Likert item that asked respondents their
opinion of “having a strong leader who does not bother with parliament or elections”
(1=very good, 4=very bad, reverse coded) as a measure of preference for a dominant
leader. For perceived general lack of control, they used a 10-point Likert item, which
asked respondents to indicate how much freedom of choice and control they have
over the way their lives turn out (1=no choice at all, 10 = a great deal of choice, reverse
coded). They also used five control variables from the WVS (subjective social class,
gender, age, political ideology and income category). However, they did not use any
of the economic uncertainty variables included in the WVS. Instead, as their measure
of economic uncertainty, they used the change in unemployment in a country from one
year to the next, which was extracted from the Word Development Indicators (WDI)
database from the World Bank. They found support for our hypotheses H1a and H2a
predicted preference for a dominant leader. However, the adjusted R2 is very low (Adj
R2=0.002) and there is no difference in the adjusted R2 between the model including
only the control variables and the models that also included economic uncertainty
alone or together with perceived general lack of control. This might be the
consequence of using the same value of economic uncertainty (i.e., change in
unemployment) for all the respondents from the same country within a year, which
totally eliminates the variation in economic uncertainty between individuals in the same
country. To improve on their analysis, we use individual-level variables extracted from
the WVS to measure economic uncertainty. Moreover, we adopt a model comparison
approach to compare the strength of economic uncertainty, perceived general lack of
control and inter-group conflict in predicting preferences for both dominant and
prestigious leaders.
2.2. Methods
We used the same item as Kakkar and Sivanathan to measure the outcome
variable preference for a dominant leader. Our second outcome variable, preference
for a prestigious leader, was measured with a 4-point Likert item (1=very good, 4=very
bad) in which respondents gave their opinion about the way of governing: “having
experts, not government, make decisions according to what they think is best for the
country” (1=very good, 4 very bad, reverse coded). We chose this item because it is
consistent with Henrich and Gil-White’s prestige definition, which centres on
knowledge and skill as key aspects of leadership.
For the predictor variable economic uncertainty we used five items. Two of
those items asked respondents to indicate how worried they were about the possibility
of losing or not finding a job (EcUnJOB) and about not being able to give their children
a good education (EcUnEDUCATION) (1=very much, 4= not at all, reverse coded).
The remaining three items asked respondents to indicate how often in the last 12
months they or their family have gone without enough food to eat (EcUnFOOD),
without medicine or medical treatments they needed (EcUnMEDICINE), and without a
cash income (EcUnCASH) (1=often, 4=never, reverse coded). Intergroup conflict was
measured with three 4-point Likert items indicating how often respondents are worried
about a war involving their country (InConINTWAR), a civil war (InConCIVILWAR) or
a terrorist attack (InConTERRORISM) (1=very much, 4=not at all, reverse coded).
Each item for both the economic uncertainty variable and the intergroup conflict
variable were used as separate predictors to preserve their meaning. This also
entailed to treat each Likert item as ordinal rather than averaging it and treating it as
continuous. Perceived lack of control was measured with the same item as Kakkar
and Sivanathan used (see Section 2.1.). As control variables we used the same
variables as Kakkar and Sivanathan: age, gender, income category (10-point Likert
scale from lowest group to highest group within respondents’ country), subjective
social class (5-point Likert scale, 1=upper class, 5=lower class, reverse coded) and
political ideology (10-point Likert item from left to right).
After excluding respondents who did not provide information from one or more
of these variables, the dataset contained 52325 respondents (26209 females, 26116
males) aged 16-99 (M=41.27, SD=15.95) from 54 different countries.
Because both outcome variables (preference for a dominant leader and
preference for a prestigious leader) are ordered categorical variables and respondents
lived in different countries, we used ordinal mixed effects logistic regression models to
analyse the data (Bürkner & Vuorre, 2019) with intercepts varying by country of
respondents. As the predictor variables of interest (i.e., the items used as proxies for
economic uncertainty, lack of control and intergroup conflict) were ordered categorical
variables, we modelled their relationship with the outcome variable as monotonic
effects (Bürkner & Charpentier, 2018) with the package brms (Bürkner, 2017). As most
variables were ordered, instead of continuous, we did not centre or standardize the
variables.
2.3.- Results
2.3.1.- Which variables predict preference for a dominant leader?
To analyse the relationship between the predictors of interest and the
preference for a dominant political leader we ran several Bayesian regression models
with default flat priors in brms and compared their model fit using leave-one-out cross
2 for regression coefficients and LOOIC values. Similarly to Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) and Watanabe-Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC), a lower LOOIC
indicates better model fit. First, we ran a null model (LOOIC=132040.6, SE=212.0),
with only the intercepts as predictors. The Variance Ratio (a Bayesian equivalent to
the Intraclass Correlation) in this null model was 0.06, meaning that the 6% of the
variance in preferences for dominant leaders is explained by the clustering of
respondents within countries. This is a relatively small value but important enough to
justify the use of multilevel modelling to attain accurate estimates. This model was
compared to a control model (LOOIC=131955.3, SE=212.6), which included all the
control variables. As the model fit of the control model was better than the fit of the null
model, we used the control model as a base for constructing and comparing the model
fit of subsequent models.

To test H1a, which predicted that economic uncertainty is positively related to
preferences for a dominant leader, we ran a model that included the 5 items for
economic uncertainty and the control variables (LOOIC= 131509.0, SE=215.5).
Supporting H1a, the economic uncertainty model had a better fit than the control model
(LOOIC=131955.3, SE=212.6). Four items (EcUnJOB: B=0.05, SE=0.01, 89% CI
[0.04, 0.06]; EcUnEDUCATION: B=0.04, SE=0.01, 89% CI[0.02, 0.06]; EcUnFOOD:
B=0.15, SE=0.02, 89% CI [0.12, 0.18; EcUnMEDICINE: B=0.06, SE=0.01, 89%
CI[0.04,0.07]) were, as expected, positively related to preference for a dominant
leader, while one item (EcUnCASH, B=-0.05, SE=0.01, 89% CI [-0.07, -0.04]) was,
contrary to expectations, negatively related to preference for a dominant leader.
To test H2a, which predicted that perceived lack of control is positively related
to preferences for a dominant leader, we ran a model that included perceived lack of
control and the control variables (LOOIC=131940.8, SE=212.8). This model had a
better fit than the control model (LOOIC=131955.3, SE=212.6). However, the fit of this
model was worse than the fit of the economic uncertainty model (LOOIC= 131509.0,
SE=215.5), which indicates that perceived lack of control was less important in
predicting preference for a dominant leader than economic uncertainty. The addition
of perceived lack of control to the economic uncertainty model did not improve the
latter’s model fit (LOOIC=131509.8, SE=215.5) and the credible interval for perceived
general lack of control crossed zero (B=0.01, SE=0.01, 89% CI[-0.01, 0.01] indicating
an unreliable effect of perceived lack of control on preferences for a dominant leader.
To test H3a, which predicted a positive relationship between intergroup conflict
and preference for a dominant leader, we ran a model that included the three
intergroup conflict items and the control variables (LOOIC=131669.3, SE=215.1).
Supporting H3a, the intergroup conflict model had a better fit than the control model
(LOOIC=131955.3, SE=212.6). Two of the intergroup conflict items (InConINTWAR,
B=0.07, SE-0.01, CI 89% [0.05, 0.09]; InConCIVILWAR: B=0.12, SE=0.01, 89% CI
[0.10, 0.14]) were, as expected, positively related to preference for a dominance
leader, while one item (InConTERRORISM, B=-0.06, SE=0.01, 89% CI [-0.08, -0.04])
was, contrary to expectations, negatively related. However, the fit of these models was
worse than the fit of the economic uncertainty model (LOOIC= 131509.0, SE=215.5),
which indicates that intergroup conflict had less importance than economic uncertainty
in predicting preference for a dominant leader.
Lastly, we ran a full model including all the variables. This model had the best
fit of all models (LOOIC=131335.1, SE=217.0). This indicates that, although economic
uncertainty is a stronger predictor than intergroup conflict, intergroup conflict is still an
important predictor of preference for a dominant leader. In the full model, three of the
economic uncertainty variables were positively associated with preference for a
dominant leader (EcUnJOB: B=0.05, SE=0.01, 89% CI [0.03, 0.06]; EcUnFOOD:
B=0.15, SE=0.02, 89% CI [0.12, 0.17]; EcUnMEDICINE: B=0.06, SE=0.01, 89% CI
[0.04, 0.08]), while two of the economic uncertainty variables were negatively related
(EcUnEDUCATION: B=-0.02, SE=0.01, 89% CI [-0.03, -0.01; EcUnCASH: B=-0.04,
SE=0.01, 89% CI [-0.06, -0.02]); two of the intergroup conflict variables were positively
related to preference for a dominant leader (InConINTWAR: B=0.06, SE=0.01, 89%
CI [0.04, 0.08]; InConCIVILWAR: B=0.11, SE=0.01, 89% CI [0.09, 0.13]), while one
was negatively related (InConTERRORISM: B=-0.05, SE=0.01, 89% CI [-0.07, -0.03]).
Perceived lack of control had an unreliable effect on preference for a dominant leader
as its credible interval crossed zero (B=0.00, SE=0.00, 89% CI [-0.00, 0.01]).
2.3.2.- Which variables predict preference for a prestigious leader?
Here we ran the same models as for preference for a dominant leader but with
(LOOIC=131903.6, SE=214.2) had a Variance Ratio of 0.06, justifying the use of
multilevel modelling. Again, this null model had worse fit than the control model
(LOOIC=131641.5, SE=215.7). Consequently, we used the control model as a base
for constructing and comparing the model fit of the subsequent models.

Supporting H1b, the economic uncertainty model (LOOIC=131600.2,
SE=216.2) had a better fit than the control model (LOOIC=131641.5, SE=215.7). Four
items were, as expected, positively related to preference for a prestigious leader
(EcUnJOB: B=0.05, SE=0.01, 89% CI [ 0.04, 0.07]; EcUnEDUCATION: B=0.04,

related.
Contrary to H2b, the lack of control model (LOOIC=131864, SE=214.7) had
worse fit than the control model (LOOIC=131641.5, SE=215.7). The inclusion of
perceived lack of control to the economic uncertainty model hardly improved its model
fit (LOOIC=131600.2).
Contrary to H3b, the intergroup conflict model (LOOIC=131704.8, SE=215.8)
had worse fit than the control model (LOOIC=131641.5, SE=215.7).
The full model including all the variables (LOOIC=131541.0, SE=216.6) had the
best fit of all the models. In the full model, three of the economic uncertainty items
were positively related to preference for a prestigious leader (EcUnJOB: B=0.05,

negatively related (EcUnCASH: B=-0.04, SE=0.01, 89% CI [-0.06, -0.01]) and another
item had an unreliable effect (EcUnEDUCATION: B=-0.02, SE=0.01, 89% CI [-0.04,
0.01]); two of the intergroup conflict items were positively related to preference for a
prestigious leader (InConINTWAR: B=0.06, SE=0.01, 89% CI [0.03, 0.08];
InConCIVILWAR: B=0.11, SE=0.01, 89% CI [0.08, 0.13]), while one item was
negatively related (InConTERRORISM: B=-0.05, SE=0.01, 89% CI [-0.08, -0.03].
Perceived lack of control had an unreliable effect of preference for a prestigious leader
(B=-0.01, SE=0.00, 89% CI [-0.01, 0.00).
2.4.- Discussion
In Study 1, we tested whether economic uncertainty, perceived lack of control
and intergroup conflict positively predict preference for dominant and prestigious
leaders. Previous research has focused on how these variables predict preference for
a dominant leader but, to the best of our knowledge, no research has tested how these
variables predict preference for a prestigious leader. Moreover, previous studies with
data from the WVS (Kakkar and Sivanathan 2017) used group-level measures of the
predictor variables, whereas we used individual-level measures, providing a more fine-
grained analysis.
Similarly to Kakkar and Sivanathan (2017), we found that some of our
measures of economic uncertainty predicted preference for a dominant leader. In our
study, however, the same measures of economic uncertainty also predicted
preference for a prestigious leader. The fact that economic uncertainty is related to
preferences for both types of leaders casts doubt on previous claims of the specificity
of the link between economic uncertainty and preference for dominant leaders. Our
results suggest that economic uncertainty might simply increase preference for
leadership in general, instead of for dominant leadership in particular.
Alternatively, the relationship between economic uncertainty and preference for
both dominant and prestigious leaders might be mediated or moderated by
respondents’ traits or states. Here, we examined the relationship between one of these
individual variables, perceived general lack of control, and preference for dominant
and prestigious leaders. Perceived general lack of control has been proposed to be
positively related to preference for a dominant leader and to be the psychological
mechanism by which facing economic uncertainty makes an individual more likely to
prefer a dominant leader (Kakkar & Sivanathan, 2017). We therefore proposed that
perceived lack of control would also be positively related to preference for prestigious
leaders. However, we did not find support for any of these predictions as perceived
lack of control had an unreliable effect on predicting preference for both dominant and
prestigious leaders. Consequently, perceived lack of control does not seem to be the
mechanism that explains the higher preference for both dominant and prestigious
leaders when facing economic uncertainty.
Similarly to previous studies (Laustsen & Petersen, 2017; Little et al., 2007), we
found that some of our measures of intergroup conflict predicted preference for a
dominant leader. Although the fit of the intergroup conflict model for predicting
preference for a prestigious leader was worse than the fit of the control model, two
intergroup conflict items were positively related to preference for a prestigious leader
in the full model, which had the best fit of all. This again casts doubt of the specificity
of the relationship between intergroup conflict and preference for a dominant leader.
As we suggest above, dominant behaviours directed against out-groups might serve
to gain prestige within the in-group (Halevy et al., 2012). This explains why people
might prefer an authoritarian over a democratic government when political repression
is exercised against out-groups considered enemies of the in-group (e.g., political
dissidents in Stalin’s USSR). Although further research is necessary to confirm this,
when respondents are asked about their preferences for dominant and prestigious
leaders, it is likely that respondents are imagining that the political authoritarianism
and the expertise would be used in favour of the in-group and/or against out-groups.
Compared to previous studies, our study has the advantage of comparing
preferences for different types of leadership (dominance vs prestige) when studying
the effects of specific social contexts such as economic uncertainty or inter-group
conflict on preferences for one type of leader. Another advantage is the simultaneous
use of different measures of economic uncertainty and intergroup conflict. As the
results suggest, not all measures of these variables are positively related to
preferences for dominant and prestigious leaders. It seems that being worried about
not having or finding a job, and not having had enough food and medicine in the last
12 months are stronger predictors on preferences for dominant and prestigious
leaders than being worried about access to education and not having enough income.
Similarly, open inter-group conflict (inter-country or civil war) positively predict
preference for dominant and prestigious leaders, while more unidirectional violence
(terrorism) is negatively related to preference for both types of leaders. We are not
sure why these different economic uncertainty and inter-group conflict variables are
related to preferences for both types of leaders in different directions. However, the
results make clear that selecting some of these variables might bias the conclusions
of studies investigating the relationship between particular economic and intergroup
contexts and preferences for different types of leaders. Consequently, we recommend
using multiple proxies for economic uncertainty and intergroup conflict in future
studies.
Study 1 has the limitation of using measures of dominant (“strong leader who
does not bother with parliament or elections”) and prestigious (“experts, not
government, [who] make decisions according to what they think is best for the
country”) leaders that describe dictators and technocrats respectively. Dictatorship
and technocracy are not incompatible forms of ruling a country. For example,
technocrats occupied ministries and had special relevance in Franco’s dictatorship in
the 1960s in Spain. Moreover, these measures (dictator/technocrat) are not totally
comparable to the measures of dominance and prestige commonly used to study the
dual evolutionary model of social hierarchy such as the scale developed by Cheng et
al. (2010). This problem was addressed in Study 2.
3.- STUDY 2
3.1.- Introduction
In this study, we first analyse how political ideology influences perceptions of
Kakkar and Sivanathan (2018), we use self-ratings of political ideology and ratings of
the perceived dominance and prestige of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton collected
during the campaigns for the 2016 US Presidential Elections. American politics
provides a particularly clear in-group vs out-group within-country comparison, with only
two major political parties (Democrats and Republicans) represented by single
candidates (in 2016, Clinton and Trump respectively) that are divided on many political
and social issues. In line with H4, we expect to find that liberal ideology is positively
related to perceptions of Trump as dominant and negatively related to perceptions of
Clinton as dominant. In line with H5, we expect to find that liberal ideology is positively
related to perceptions of Clinton as prestigious and negatively related to perceptions
of Trump as prestigious. Second, we compare the strength of political ideology and
economic uncertainty in predicting preferences for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.
Following H6, we expect to find that political ideology is a stronger predictor of voting
decision than economic uncertainty.
While H4 and H5 are unexplored in previous research, H6 has been explicitly
addressed by Kakkar and Sivanathan (2017). In a pretest to their Study 1, they asked
120 Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) participants to rate the prestige (agreement with
statements such as “I think compared to Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump is a kind of
leader who is respected and admired by other members”) and dominance (agreement
with statements such as “I think compared to Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton is a kind
of leader who might be feared by some members”) of both candidates using an
adapted shorter version of a validated scale of prestige and dominance (Cheng et al.,
2010). Agreement was rated on a Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much).
Participants also rated their own political ideology on a 7-point Likert scale from 1
(conservative/republican) to 7 (liberal/democrat), but the authors did not use this for
their analysis. The data was collected during the day of the third presidential debate
(20 October 2016). The results showed that the ratings of dominance were significantly
higher for Trump (M=5.5, SD=1.5) than for Clinton (M=4.7, SD=1.8), while the ratings
of prestige were higher for Clinton (M=4.7, SD=1.7) than for Trump (M=3.54,
SD=1.87), leading to Kakkar and Sivanathan equating Donald Trump with a dominant
leader.
On the same day, they asked 750 AMT participants about their intention to vote
for Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton or neither, as well as their political ideology using the
scale described above. They measured economic uncertainty using an aggregated
measure of the rates of unemployment, house vacancy and poverty within the ZIP
code of each participant, extracted from the Distress Community Index (Economic
Innovation Group, 2016). A multinomial regression with economic uncertainty, political
ideology and several control variables showed that economic uncertainty was
positively related to preference for Trump over Clinton. As the coefficient of economic
uncertainty was larger than the coefficient for political ideology they concluded that
“economic uncertainty predicted a preference for Donald Trump over and above (…)
political partisanship” (p. 6736). However, their coefficients were not standardized and,
therefore, their conclusion might be misleading. In fact, the difference in proportion of
variance explained by their models with (Adjusted R2 = 0.227) and without economic
uncertainty (Adjusted R2 = 0.222) is only 0.5%, which diminishes the importance of
economic uncertainty in predicting voting intention for Trump. In our Study 2, we use
the data from Kakkar and Sivanathan. Like those authors, we conducted multinomial
regressions. We adopted a model comparison approach to make more reliable
comparisons between the strength of economic uncertainty and political ideology,
rather than comparing unstandardised coefficients. As we did not find a way to run
multinomial Bayesian regression using ordered categorical predictors, we ran
frequentist models using AIC instead of LOOIC for the model comparisons and treated
ordered categorical variables as if they were continuous. A difference of at least two
AICs is considered to constitute a reliable difference between models in their fit to the
data. We assume that models with AICs that differ by less than two do not differ in
their ability to explain the data. All the models were run in Stata 16 (Stata Corp, 2019).
3.2.- Methods
For testing H4 and H5, we used the data from the sample of 120 participants in
Kakkar and Sivanathan (2017). For testing H6, we used the data from the sample of
750 participants in Kakkar and Sivanathan (2017). We also tested H6 using the actual
results of the US Presidential Elections of 2016. To this end, we conducted binomial
regressions in which Donald Trump’s victory within each state was predicted by the
level of economic uncertainty within the state and the percentage of votes obtained by
the Republicans in previous Presidential Elections (2012) as a proxy for political
ideology.
3.3.- Results
As prestige and dominance have been conceptualized as two separate
constructs (See Section 1.2) and the results of previous studies have shown that
prestige and dominance barely correlate (Brand & Mesoudi, 2019; Cheng et al., 2013;
Cheng et al., 2010; Kakkar, Gobel, & Sivanathan, Submitted; Monge-López & Álvarez-
Solas, 2017; Redhead, Cheng, Driver, Foulsham, & O'Gorman, 2018), we first
explored whether averaged ratings of prestige and dominance for each political
candidate were correlated. Contrary to previous studies, we found a moderate
negative correlation between the ratings of dominance and prestige for both
with 89% confidence intervals (grey area) and marginal histograms. Left: average dominance ratings and average
prestige ratings for Hillary Clinton. Right: average dominance ratings and average prestige ratings for Donald
Trump.
Supporting H4, we found that liberal ideology was positively related to ratings
of Trump as dominant (r=0.57) and negatively related to ratings of Clinton as dominant
(r=-0.45). Supporting H5, we found that liberal ideology was positively related to
ratings of Clinton as prestigious (r=0.44) and negatively related to ratings of Trump as
and political ideology of participants on a scale from 1 (conservative/Republican) to 7 (liberal/Democrat) with 89 %
Confidence Intervals (grey areas) and marginal histograms. Left: Clinton. Right: Trump.
To test H6, that political ideology is a stronger predictor of voting decisions than
economic uncertainty, we carried out a number of multinomial logistic regression
models (Finch, Bolin, & Kelley, 2014, pp. 131-133) with voting for neither Trump nor
(AIC=1541.65) with and without intercepts varying by State. The fit of the single-level
null model (AIC = 1541.978) was better than the fit of the multilevel null model (AIC =
1544.296). Consequently, multilevel modelling was not necessary here. All the
subsequent models are single-level models.
Second, we compared the fit of the null model with a control model, which
included age, gender and income as predictors (AIC=1518.949). Given its better fit,
we used the control model as a base for the following models. Third, we compared the
control model with a model that also included separately the three economic
uncertainty variables (poverty rate, unemployment rate, and housing vacancy rate).
The model fit of this economic uncertainty model (AIC = 1516.061) was slightly better
than the control model. However, a model with the control variables and political
ideology as predictors had considerably better fit (AIC = 1283.126) than the economic
uncertainty model. Lastly, a full model was computed, which had the best fit of all
models (AIC=1220.082). These results support H6, i.e., political ideology is a stronger
predictor of voting decision than economic uncertainty. In the full model, liberal
ideology positively predicted preference for Clinton (b=0.62, SE=0.07, 89% CI [0.51,
0.73]) and negatively predicted preference for Trump (b=-0.60, SE=0.08, 89% CI [-
0.73, -0.47). Among the economic uncertainty variables, the only one that supports a
greater preference for Trump (B = 7.29, SE = 3.39, 89 % CI [1.87, 12.70] than for
Clinton (B = 0.52, SE = 2.90, CI [-4.10, 5.16] when facing economic uncertainty is
housing vacancy rate. Poverty rate is negatively related to both preferences for Clinton
(B= -2.42, SE=1.31, CI 89% [-4.52, -0.32]) and Trump (B = -0.96, SE = 1.57, 89% CI
[-3.47, 1.55]. However, the CI for Trump crosses zero indicating that the negative
relationship is not reliable. Unemployment rate is also negatively related to
preferences for both Clinton (-1.06, SE =1.44, 89% CI [-3.37, 1.25]) and Trump (B = -
1.90, SE = 1.78, 89% CI [-4.76, 0.94]). For both candidates, this negative relationship
is not reliable as both CIs cross zero.
Four alternative statistical procedures were conducted to confirm these results
(see Appendix 1). In all these, we found that political ideology was a stronger predictor
of voting decision than economic uncertainty.

Lastly, we tested H6 by comparing how well economic uncertainty and political
ideology predicted the actual victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 Presidential
with the economic uncertainty variables at the level of the State (AIC=67.30), a model
with political ideology measured with the percentage of votes for Republicans in the
elections of 2012 (AIC=19.37) and a full model that included both economic
uncertainty and political ideology (AIC=20.52). Although the economic uncertainty
model improved the fit of the null model, both the political ideology model and the full
model had a better fit to the data. In the political ideology model, the percentage of
votes for Republicans in 2012 positively predicted the victory of Donald Trump in a
State (b=0.81, SE=0.38, 89% CI [0.19, 1.44]). Three alternative statistical procedures
were conducted to confirm these results (see Appendix 2). In all these, we found that
political ideology was a stronger predictor of voting decision than economic
uncertainty.

3.4.- Discussion
In Study 2, we first examined how political ideology influences ratings of
prestige and dominance of political leaders, using Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton
as stimuli. Second, we compared the strength of political orientation and economic
uncertainty in predicting preference for Trump or Clinton.
Contrary to previous studies that found that ratings of dominance and prestige
for the same individuals are uncorrelated, the ratings of dominance and prestige for
both Trump and Clinton were negatively correlated. This might be due to the polarized
attitudes towards both candidates in the US at the time of collecting the data.
Supporting this, we found that ratings of both dominance and prestige were influenced
by political ideology. As predicted by H4 and H5, liberal ideology was positively
correlated with ratings of Trump as dominant and Clinton as prestigious, and
negatively correlated with ratings of Hillary as dominant and Trump as prestigious.
This highlights the importance of exploring the relationship between individual
variables such as political ideology with dominance and prestige before concluding
that a politician is either dominant or prestigious. Kakkar and Sivanathan (2017)
concluded that Trump was a dominant leader and Clinton a prestigious leader because
ANOVAs comparing the ratings of dominance and prestige of both candidates yielded
p-values smaller than 0.05. However, as the variation in the ratings was related to
political ideology the inferences about the preferences for dominant or prestigious
political leaders in this context is misleading. Consequently, future studies should pay
careful attention to potential systematic variation in the perceptions of dominance and
prestige of the stimuli to avoid potential misleading inferences (see Mileva, Jones,
Russell, & Little, 2016, p. for another example of variation of perceptions of dominance
and prestige related to participants' characteristics). This is especially important when
studying political issues, as the lack of political diversity in social science disciplines
such as psychology, which is heavily skewed towards the left (Langbert, Quain, &
Klein, 2016), might lead to less questioning of research methods that yield results in
agreement with researchers’ own political views (Duarte et al., 2015, Martin, 2016), as
well as biased results if psychology undergraduates are used as participants.
Although the results of Study 2 show that perceptions of dominance and
prestige of both candidates are associated with participants’ political ideologies, this
does not mean that Clinton and Trump did not differ in their use of the dominance and
prestige strategies during the presidential debates. Indeed, Witkower (2017)
demonstrated that Clinton showed more demonstrations of knowledge and non-verbal
displays associated with the prestige strategy such as smiling than Trump, while
Trump made more verbal attacks and showed more non-verbal displays associated
with the dominance strategy (e.g., occupying more space and extending his arms)
than Clinton. As argued earlier, the use of the dominance strategy against out-groups
(which for Republicans would be Democrats) might lead to higher prestige among
members of the in-group. Experimental evidence, however, is necessary to test this
prediction.
Supporting H6, our results also contradict Kakkar and Sivanathan’s conclusion
that economic uncertainty is a stronger predictor of voting decision for Trump than
political ideology. This is because we conducted model comparisons taking in and out
both predictors , which we considered more appropriate for comparing the relative
strength of economic uncertainty and political ideology than comparing
unstandardized coefficients. Political ideology was also a stronger predictor than
economic uncertainty in predicting preference for Donald Trump when we used the
data of the actual 2016 US Elections.
A limitation of our study, however, is that the data does not include any measure
of whether the popularity of Donald Trump in the 2016 elections was motivated by a
cultural backlash against post-materialist values and political correctness as
participants were not asked about these issues. Furthermore, when people decide to
vote for a specific candidate in the elections it is also possible that they move towards
the candidate’s ideology5, which would explain why political ideology is such a strong
predictor of voting decision. Supporting this, the results of a longitudinal study show
that people tended to vote for the candidates of the same party in the US Presidential
Elections of 2012 and 2016 but that from one to the other there was a slight but
important change in party identification in favour of the Republican party (Mutz,
2018b). The same study also found that personal economic hardship including
subjective judgement of the economic situation did not predict voting for Trump.
However, increases in Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), which is related to
preference for group-based dominance, positively predicted voting for Trump. The
results of Mutz’s study are congruent with Inglehart and Norris’ cultural backlash
hypothesis and, as in our study, they diminish the importance of economic uncertainty
in predicting preference for Trump over Clinton (but see debate about the correct way
to analyse and interpret the data; Morgan, 2018a, 2018b; Mutz, 2018a).
4. - GENERAL DISCUSSION
In this article, we first reviewed how the dual evolutionary model of social
hierarchy has been used to explain the rise in popularity and electoral victories of right-
wing populist leaders such as Donald Trump. Second, we highlighted the limitations
5 People can also vote against a candidate or political party, instead of in favour of a candidate/party. In this
sense, some people who did not like Donald Trump voted for him because they dislike more Hillary Clinton
and/or the Democrats. Some people who did not like Hillary Clinton voted for her because they dislike more
Donald Trump and/or the Republicans.
of applying this model to large-scale democratic societies without clearly distinguishing
between in-groups and out-groups. Third, we showed that both economic uncertainty
and intergroup conflict predict preference for both dominant and prestigious leaders
using data from the WVS. Consequently, it does not seem that either economic
uncertainty or intergroup conflict have a unique link with increased preferences for
dominant leaders, as previous research has suggested (Kakkar & Sivanathan, 2017;
Laustsen & Petersen, 2017; Little et al., 2007). Third, we showed that perceptions of
political leaders as either dominant or prestigious are not universal, but depend on
people’s political ideologies. Conservatives perceive conservative political leaders as
prestigious and liberal political leaders as dominant, while liberals perceive
conservative political leaders as dominant and liberal political leaders as prestigious.
This highlights the importance of distinguishing between in-groups and out-groups
within societies when reaching conclusions about preferences for dominant or
prestigious leaders. Fourth, we showed that political ideology is a stronger predictor
of preference for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton than economic uncertainty,
contradicting previous conclusions attributing greater importance to the economy than
ideology in explaining Donald Trump’s victory in 2016 (see Kakkar & Sivanathan,
2017).
Although previous work has equated right-wing populist leaders to dominant
leaders (e.g., Trump) and well-established (liberal) politicians (e.g., Clinton) to
prestigious leaders (Kakkar & Sivanathan, 2017), Study 2 clearly shows that people
perceive the dominance and prestige of political leaders differently depending on their
own ideological similarity to those political leaders. Furthermore, as economic
uncertainty does not seem to affect people’s voting decision directly, we suggest
looking at the political discourse of right-wing populist leaders and how it interacts with
the discourse of other political actors to explain their rise in electoral popularity.
Previous research has shown that particular features of information such as being
simple (Heath & Heath, 2008), concrete (Heath & Heath, 2008), emotional (Eriksson
& Coultas, 2014; Heath, Bell, & Sternberg, 2001; Heath & Heath, 2008; Stubbersfield,
Flynn, & Tehrani, 2017) or negative (Bebbington, MacLeod, Ellison, & Fay, 2017)
increases its chances of being transmitted accurately. As the right-wing populist
discourse seems to contain these features in a greater proportion (e.g., higher
emotional content; Breeze, 2018; Wirz, 2018) than the political discourse of traditional
politicians, we suggest that this might explain the rise in electoral popularity of right-
wing populist leaders. Nevertheless, the political discourse of part of the left (e.g., the
emotional discourse of Greta Thunberg at the UN; PBS NewsHour, 2019) and against
right-wing populist leaders (e.g., the emotional reaction after the election of Donald
Trump as President of the US; Campbell & Manning, 2018, pp. viii-xix) sometimes
presents the same content characteristics (i.e., simple, concrete, emotional and
negative). Consequently, we suggest that the study of the transmissibility of the right-
wing populist discourse and the discourse against right-wing populism should always
take into account the political ideology of participants and the interaction between
ideological groups.
In conclusion, while there have been prominent claims linking the rise of right-
wing populist leaders, via economic uncertainty, to the dominance strategy of social
rank acquisition and leadership, in this paper we have highlighted several limitations
of this thesis, alongside re-analyses and novel analyses to support our arguments. We
hope to have contributed to continuing interdisciplinary efforts to improve our
understanding of these major social and political trends that increasingly characterise
our current times.
