The Swiss Corona Stress Study, second pandemic wave - v2020-12-16
Abstract
The results of the third survey of the Swiss Corona Stress Study refer to
the period from November 11-19, 2020, during which 11,612 people from all
over Switzerland participated. Stress levels have increased significantly
compared to the first survey during lockdown in April 2020. While the
proportion of people reporting maximum stress levels was around 11%
during the April lockdown, it rose to 20% in the second pandemic wave in
November. The increase in stress was accompanied by an increase in
depressive symptoms. The main drivers of psychological stress and
depressive symptoms included burden due to a Covid-19-related change in
work, school, or education, Covid-19-related financial losses, and fears
about the future. These stressors have increased significantly, compared to
the time of the April lockdown. Further factors were the fear that someone
in the closest circle would become seriously ill or die from COVID-19, as
well as the burden of social restrictions and burden from an increase in
conflicts at home. While the proportion of respondents with moderately
severe or severe (PHQ-9 ≥15) depressive symptoms was 3% before the
pandemic, 9% during the April lockdown, and 12% during May, it increased
to 18% in November. The risk for moderately severe or severe depressive
symptoms was associated with age (with younger people showing the
highest risk) and was increased in people experiencing financial losses
due to the pandemic. In addition, people from the French-speaking part of
Switzerland, which was most affected by the pandemic during the second
wave, were at higher risk than people from the rest of Switzerland.
The Swiss Corona Stress Study, second pandemic wave - v2020-12-16
Introduction
Governments across the globe responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with restrictions
to people’s daily lives unprecedented in modern democratic societies during peacetime.
Self-isolation, quarantines, shutdowns of educational institutions, recreational facilities
and businesses had dramatic consequences for economies and are likely to impact
mental health of the population in the short- and long-term. During the summer of 2020
in the northern hemisphere governments were able to relax the anti-COVID-19
measures, but face-masks have become probably the most publicly visible symbol of
the continuing pandemic crisis. In the northern hemisphere COVID-19 case numbers
were increasing in autumn 2020, in many countries even surpassing the case numbers
and death toll seen in spring 2020; at the same time the successful search for vaccines
raised hopes for many since several countries have started vaccination programmes.
These phases of the COVID-19 pandemic have felt like a roller-coaster ride to many
people. In spring 2020 we set up the Swiss Corona Stress Study online survey to gain a
better understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. We
collected data anonymously during the first confinement between the 6th and the 8th of
April 2020 (survey 1), capturing a range of demographic aspects as well as perceived
stress, depression and anxiety levels. We repeated the survey with adaptations twice in
​ ​
the partial lifting of measures (partial deconfinement) (survey 2) and during the second
upsurge of the pandemic from the 11th until the 19th of November 2020 (survey 3).
Each survey collected data from over 10,000 participants.
Limited knowledge of the health impact of the pandemic and of the counter measures
makes finding the appropriate level of countermeasures a very difficult task. The impact
of the pandemic differs considerably between occupational groups and social strata of
the society. Some people have been unable to continue their careers, while others have
The Swiss Corona Stress Study, second pandemic wave - v2020-12-16
been overwhelmed with work and many switched to work from home for an
unprecedented length of time. An approximation of the consequences of COVID-19 and
its subsequent ramifications on our daily lives can be drawn from stress research.
Stress can be conceptualized as being confronted with a challenging situation that
requires some kind of adaptation [1]. With the imminent threat of getting infected, the
​ ​​
problems arising from the governmental restrictions and the uncertainty about how and
when people will be able to return to their normal routine, this situation is challenging for
many. Humans are generally well-equipped to deal with challenges as our stress
system is highly adaptive, and during phases of stress, anxiety and worries are normal
reactions. However, since stress is a well-known risk factor for mental disorders,
vulnerable individuals may be at increased risk to develop stress-related mental health
problems in the current situation [2]. A position paper published in Lancet Psychiatry on
​​ ​
April 15, 2020 explored psychological, social and neuroscientific consequences of the
COVID-19 to inform immediate priorities and long-term strategies for public health and
research. The position paper was based on surveys of the United Kingdom population.
It emphasizes the immediate priority to collect data on the mental health effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups [3]. Until solid
​​ ​​
data are available, we can only speculate about the impact of COVID-19 on mental
health. It is also possible that the occurrence of a common health crisis might trigger
protective factors with regard to mental well-being. For example, in the wake of past
national disasters that posed a possible threat to physical integrity (such as September
11, 2001) suicide rates have declined [4]. It was hypothesized that this effect might have
​​ ​​
been driven by increased social cohesion and stronger support from friends and families
[4], [5]. It is also possible that the governmental restrictions during this crisis may entail
​​
relieving aspects, at least for some individuals. The generation of knowledge about the
mental health consequences and the identification of risk and resilience factors is of
utmost importance to inform about needs during the current and subsequent outbreaks
of COVID-19 or any future outbreak of this sort.
The Swiss Corona Stress Study, second pandemic wave - v2020-12-16
This study, the “Swiss Corona Stress Study”, investigates how the Swiss population
adapts to the COVID-19 outbreak and the confinement measures in Switzerland; for an
analysis of data collected during surveys 1 and 2 see de Quervain et al. [6]. In a
​ ​
companion study, "The Iranian Corona Stress Study", data was collected from
participants in Iran between May 1st and May 25th, 2020 [7]. These studies set out to
​ ​
identify risk- and resilience factors, in particular behaviors amenable to change. Stress
research has a long history and various evidence-based interventions to counter stress
have been proposed [5], [8], [9]. However, since the COVID-19 pandemic is
​​ ​​
unprecedented, we lack evidence about whether the existing interventions are effective
in the context of a pandemic lockdown. In a first stage of data analysis published earlier
[6] we focused on investigating how subjective stress levels are affected during the time
of confinement (survey 1), identifying important factors related to changes in stress
levels, including potential resilience factors, and investigating the prevalence of
moderately severe to severe depressive symptoms before the COVID-19 pandemic and
during confinement. In a second stage of data analysis, we focused on the same
analysis as in stage 1, but for the time of partial deconfinement (survey 2), and
additionally compared the two waves and investigated potential risk and resilience
factors with regard to the development of depressive symptoms.
We found notable similarities between the Iranian and the Swiss Covid Stress Studies:
The prevalence of moderately severe to severe depressive symptoms (Patient Health
Questionnaire 9, PHQ-9 >=15) increased about three-fold in both studies during the first
pandemic wave. In both studies 30-40% of the participants reported increased stress
levels, while about a quarter of the participants strikingly reported a decrease in stress
levels. We also found similar risk and resilience factors are at play, with older age being
a resilience factor and prior psychiatric disorders a risk factor.
Here, we mainly focus on the comparison between the data tof surveys 1 and 3,
1). Due to the nature of the data collection, this is by definition not a representative
The Swiss Corona Stress Study, second pandemic wave - v2020-12-16
survey. However, the population of respondents represents a broad spectrum of the
Swiss population in terms of sociodemographic characteristics, and survey 3 does not
differ in these characteristics from our previous surveys.
Methods
Study design and participants
We conducted an anonymized survey investigating the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic and the countermeasures on mental well-being in Switzerland to follow-up on
our first Swiss Corona Study conducted in April (survey 1) and May to June 2020
(survey 2) [6]. For survey 3 we collected data in November 2020. Participants from all
​ ​
regions of Switzerland were recruited through referrals to the study by a media release
of the University of Basel, local newspapers, radio interviews and social media. For data
analysis presented here all participants who completed the survey between November
11 and November 19 and had given informed consent were included if they had not
taken part in our previous surveys, lived in Switzerland and were at least 14 years old.
11,612 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. No study protocol approval by the local
Ethics committee was necessary, as the survey was anonymized. All participants gave
prior written informed consent for participation. Participants did not receive any
monetary compensation. However, they received recommendations for stress reduction
on the basis of the information given in the survey.
Procedure and outcomes
The procedure was identical to the procedure of our first two Swiss Corona Stress
​ ​
The Swiss Corona Stress Study, second pandemic wave - v2020-12-16
where they could choose one of three possible national languages, German, French or
Italian. If participants were interested to take part in the survey, they were directed to
the questionnaire. The first page of the survey contained study information and informed
consent. Only after agreement to the informed consent, the survey started and normally
could be completed within 15 minutes. The software SoSci Survey was used for online
assessment [10]. Only the day of participation was recorded in SoSci Survey, while
​ ​
IP-addresses and timestamps were not recorded.
In the first part of the survey we collected sociodemographic and further relevant data
including gender, age, nationality, country of residence, living situation, family status,
religiousness, burden of childcare, highest educational level, profession, relevant
pre-existing physical or psychiatric conditions, coronavirus diagnostic status,
acceptance of taken federal measures, fears related to the coronavirus, burdens arising
from the federal measures, changes in consumption of food / gaming / drugs / sleeping
pills and tranquilizers, changed habits, frequency of information seeking about news on
the corona crisis, changes in circadian rhythm and eating routines, level of physical
activity and meditation. Afterwards, the following outcomes of interest were assessed:
stress level and anxiety level in February, i.e. before the COVID-19 pandemic; during
lockdown in the first wave in April 2020; in September 2020 before the second
COVID-19 pandemic wave and during the two weeks immediately before the survey in
November. Stress and anxiety levels were assessed using 6-point Likert scales ranging
from 0 (not at all) to 5 (extremely strong). Depressive scores were assessed by the
“Patient Health Questionnaire 9” – PHQ-9, for the beginning of September and the two
weeks prior to the survey. PHQ-9 is a 9-question self-rating questionnaire to screen for
the presence and severity of depression. We used German, French and Italian
translations of the PHQ-9 (see [11] for English version).
​ ​
In addition, for participants who opted in, the survey continued with a
Obsessive−Compulsive Inventory−Revised (OCI-R) questionnaire using the German
version published by Gönner et al. [12], and the French and Italian translations thereof.
​ ​

At the end of the survey, participants received automated recommendations for stress
reduction on the basis of the information given in the survey, such as performing
physical activities or mindfulness exercises. All questions needed to be answered in
order to complete the survey.
Statistical analyses
Comparison of outcomes and burdens between Surveys
We compared outcomes (stress, depression and anxiety) between surveys by means of
Wilcoxon tests. Differences exceeding a Wilcoxon effect size |r| ≥ 0.1 were considered
as significant and reported. The comparison of burdens / reliefs between surveys was
conducted using both Wilcoxon and chi-square tests to identify changes in extreme
categories. Differences exceeding a Wilcoxon effect size |r| ≥ 0.1 or a Cramer’s V ≥ 0.1
(overall) were interpreted.
Identification of factors related to moderately severe and severe depressive
symptoms (PHQ-9≥15) during the second pandemic
​ ​
A logistic regression model was built between socio-demographic factors and the
categorization of depressive symptoms into moderately severe and severe (PHQ-9
score ≥15) and other (PHQ-9 score <15). Participants reporting gender different from
male / female were excluded from this analysis as well as participants reporting
unspecific household, yielding a total of N=11’393 participants. A first logistic regression
model was built considering age, gender, education (university / not university), religious
belief (believer/not believer), residency (countryside, city, agglomeration), history of
prior psychiatric disorder and canton (German, French or Italian speaking). Only main
effects showing significant statistical association and at least one post-hoc pairwise
comparison reaching Cohen’s D effect size > |0.2| (square root of log(OR)*3/pi) were
interpreted. The effect of financial consequences (loss vs. unchanged/more) was
evaluated next within this model. A second logistic regression analysis was performed
The Swiss Corona Stress Study, second pandemic wave - v2020-12-16
considering profession (students/pupils/in training, job seeking, retired, in invalidity,
house-wife/husband, workers in a sector financially impacted by the crisis, other
workers), rather than age. Likewise, the effect of financial consequences (loss vs.
unchanged/more) was next evaluated within this model. We finally conducted an
analysis within workers, irrespective of their sector of activity, accounting for age,
financial reserve and the other socio-demographic variables previously considered.
Statistical significance of main effects was assessed by likelihood ratio test between the
full model and a model discarding the variable of interest and subsequent evaluation of
Nagelkerke’s R2. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons between levels of each factor were
performed using least-square means method as implemented in the R package
lsmeans. Marginal effects within a given model were obtained using the ggeffect
function implemented in the R package ggeffect. All confidence intervals are reported at
95% threshold.
Burdens linked to age and PHQ-9 scores during the second pandemic wave
Spearman’s correlations were derived between each burden related variable and age
(continuous value) and PHQ-9 score. Burden factors were reported provided both
correlation coefficients |r| were equal to or exceeded 0.1.
Comparisons of socio-demographic factors associated with moderately
severe/severe depressive symptoms before the first pandemic and during the
second pandemic
In order to evaluate the change in association of socio-demographic factors (age,
gender, canton, prior psychiatric disorder) with elevated PHQ-9 score from the time
before the first pandemic to the time during the second pandemic wave the following
analyses were conducted. Firstly, we tested for evidence of multiplicative interactions
between each variable and ‘time point’ using logit regression. In case of significant
interactions, estimates of log odds per interaction term were obtained using least square
means. Secondly, we tested for evidence of additive interactions (assessing differences
The Swiss Corona Stress Study, second pandemic wave - v2020-12-16
in prevalences between groups, across time points) using binomial linear regression.
These latter analyses were conducted using the R package blm. Predicted percentages
per interaction term were obtained using the R predict function, under a binomial
regression model considering only the interaction term of interest. A similar approach
was conducted considering models including profession instead of age.
Stress and depressive symptoms of survey 3: relation to socio-demographic
variables, changeable behaviors, burdens, and reliefs
We applied linear models in combination with ANOVAs for nominal variables, Pearson
correlations for interval variables and Spearman’s rank correlations for ordinal variables.
For a first overview, the statistical models consisted of one dependent variable (one of
the main outcome variables) and one independent variable. In the case of linear
models, the strength of the relationships was obtained by extracting the correlation
value r from each corresponding linear model (i.e. normalized regression coefficient).
We only report relationships with at least a small effect size (|r| ≥ 0.1).
Role of funding source
The study was funded by the University of Basel. All authors had full access to all the
data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
None of the authors had any conflict of interest.

Results
Overview of survey 3 and demographics
11,612 participants were included in our analysis. The age of the participants ranged
from 14-85 (median age 38 years, mean age 39.3 years, sd 13.4). Overall, 25.5% of the
participants were male, 73.8% female; 58.4% had no children; 46.2% have a university
degree, 4.4% a doctorate, 20.8% completed an apprenticeship. 5.5% of the participants
are either going to school or are in training, 10.8% study at university and 68.6% are
currently working, 3.6% are seeking a job, 4.4 % receive a pension, 1.6% receive
disabled persons benefits.
In terms of socio-demographic characteristics, no major difference (Cramer’s V < 0.1)

Stress: comparison between survey 3 and 1
Participants from survey 3 reported higher stress levels during the second pandemic
wave as compared to stress levels reported by participants from survey 1, during the
first pandemic wave (mean survey 1 = 2.4 ; mean survey 3 = 2.8; Wilcoxon r = 0.11).
We notably observed a higher proportion of participants reporting ‘very strong’ levels of

In terms of changes in stress levels (stress level in November minus stress level in
September), a majority of participants reported higher stress levels (46.8%) or
unchanged stress levels (41.2%), while only 12.0% reported a decrease in stress.
Hence, this differs from the pattern observed during the first pandemic, where 26.0% of

Anxiety: comparison between survey 3 and 1
Levels of anxiety reported by participants from survey 3 during the second pandemic
were of comparable magnitude as levels of anxiety reported in survey 1 during the first
pandemic wave (mean survey 1: 2.0 ; mean survey 3: 2.0).
Depressive symptoms: comparison between survey 3 and 1
Participants from survey 3 reported higher depressive symptoms as compared to
participants from survey 1, both before (mean survey 1 February: 4.6, mean survey 3
September: 6.4, Wilcoxon r = 0.13) and during the pandemic wave (mean survey 1
April: 6.5; mean survey 3 November: 8.2, Wilcoxon r = 0.11). Hence, levels of
depressive symptoms in September, before the second pandemic wave, were of
comparable magnitude as those observed during the lockdown and levels of depressive
symptoms in November, during the second pandemic wave, exceeded those observed
during April lockdown.
Burdens/reliefs: comparison between survey 3 and 1
Participants from survey 3 reported lower confidence of surviving the crisis well as
compared to participants from survey 1 (Wilcoxon r = - 0.14) while higher burden due to
thoughts about the future (Wilcoxon r = 0.10), and financial consequences (Wilcoxon r =
0.11) were observed. Among pupils/students/trainees, we observed over-representation
of participants reporting ‘very strong’ burden due to change in school/study/training
(survey 1: 16.4% ; survey 3: 29.8%, overall Cramer’s V = 0.19); likewise, among
workers, a higher proportion of participants from survey 3 reported ‘very strong’ burden
for the change in the work situation (survey 1: 10.5% ; survey 3: 17.8% ; overall
​ ​
strong’ burden of increased conflicts at home (survey 1: 1.3%; survey 3: 4.4% overall
Cramer’s V = 0.12).
The Swiss Corona Stress Study, second pandemic wave - v2020-12-16
In contrast, participants from survey 3 reported lower burden of taking care of children
(Wilcoxon r = -0.11) as compared to survey 1.
Moderately severe and severe depressive symptoms (PHQ-9
≥15): Prevalence across surveys
Beyond the increase in average PHQ-9 scores during the second pandemic wave, we
also observed a significant increase in the proportion of participants reporting clinically
relevant depressive symptoms levels with 18.4% of participants showing scores within
the ‘moderately severe’ and ‘severe’ categories (PHQ-9 ≥ 15) as compared to 9.1% of
participants during the first pandemic wave (Cramer’s V = 0.13).
Overall, the percentage of participants with clinically relevant PHQ-9 scores thus
increased from an estimated 3.4% before the first pandemic wave to 18.4% during the
second pandemic wave.
Moderately severe and severe depressive symptoms
(PHQ-9≥15): Relation to socio-demographic factors in Survey 3
Given the high prevalence of participants showing clinically relevant depressive
symptoms during the second pandemic, we examined the association of high PHQ-9
(≥15) with socio-demographic factors, namely gender, age group, household (living
alone, not alone), religious belief (believer, not believer), residency (city, agglomeration,
countryside), education (university, not university), report of prior psychiatric disorder,
and Swiss canton (German speaking, Italian speaking, or French speaking) (see
Methods). Profession and age group being highly overlapping, professional status was
not considered in this first analysis.
Using logit regression, we observed significant overall effects of prior psychiatric
disorder (Nagelkerke R2 = 6.9%, p = 1.1e-107) and age group (Nagelkerke R2 = 3.4%,
p = 5.5e-48) on the prevalence of PHQ-9≥15 depressive symptoms. Specifically,
participants reporting prior psychiatric disorder showed an increased rate of moderately

severe and severe depressive symptoms during the pandemic (OR = 3.20
​ ​ ​ ​
also decreased with increasing age, with an estimated marginal prevalence of 27.3%
[CI:25-29.6%] in individuals less than 25 years old and 5.1% [CI:3.5-7.3%] in individuals
​ ​
magnitude (Nagelkerke R2 < 1%, p = 1.2e-11) of Swiss canton. Notably, post-hoc
pairwise comparisons showed higher rates of participants reporting moderately severe
and severe depressive symptoms within french speaking cantons as compared to
german speaking (OR = 1.49 [CI:1.30-1.70]) and italian speaking cantons (OR = 1.44
​ ​ ​ ​
more than 250 subjects participated revealed a positive correlation between the
proportion of moderately severe and severe depressive symptoms and the mean
incidence over a 2 week period as reported by the Federal Office of Public Health
​ ​
We next considered a model accounting for loss in financial reserve during the
pandemic (less vs. more-unchanged). The effect of financial reserve was significant
(Nagelkerke R2 = 3.6%, p = 4.7e-55) with participants reporting loss in financial reserve
at higher risk than other individuals (OR = 2.28 [CI: 2.06-2.52]). When accounting for
financial reserve, the effects of the factors previously identified remained significant
(age: p = 2.6e-43; prior psychiatric risk: p = 2.9e-98; canton: p = 5.8e-10).
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
We also considered a logit regression model considering professional status
(students/pupils/in training, seeking for a job, in invalidity, workers in a sector financially
impacted by the crisis, other workers, housewives/husbands, retired) rather than age.
As expected from the previously identified age effect, we observed a significant effect of
profession on the prevalence of moderately severe to severe depression (Nagelkerke
R2 = 3.2% , p = 4e-44), with higher prevalence on participants who are studying or are
at school while retired participants showed lower prevalence than all other groups
​ ​
searching for a job (OR: 2.16 [CI:1.53-3.0] p = 5.5e-10), in invalidity (OR: 2.05 [CI:
The Swiss Corona Stress Study, second pandemic wave - v2020-12-16
1.27-3.30], p = 2e-04), or working in a sector financially impacted by the crisis (OR: 1.70
​ ​ ​ ​ ​
while additionally accounting for financial reserve, the difference between workers in a
sector impacted by the crisis and other workers vanished (OR: 1.35 [CI: 0.99-1.85] p >
​ ​
0.05). To further evaluate the effect of age on higher depressive symptoms, we
conducted an additional analysis on workers participants, irrespective of activity sector,
aged between 18 and 64 years old (n=7’792), accounting for financial reserve. This
revealed a significant effect of age (Nagelkerke R2 = 1.1%, p = 1.3e-09) with younger
workers [18-24] showing increased prevalence as compared to older ones [45-64]
​ ​ ​ ​
Overall, these results suggest that age, financial loss due to the pandemic, and to a
smaller extent canton, are each independently associated with the prevalence of
moderately severe to severe depressive scores during the second pandemic wave. In
addition, higher prevalence is observed among workers financially impacted by the
crisis as compared to other workers.
Burdens linked to depressive symptoms scores and age during
the second pandemic wave
Given that higher depressive symptoms scores were reported in younger individuals, we
examined which burdens showed simultaneous association with both age and PHQ-9
scores (Spearman’s |r| ≥ 0.1). Younger individuals reported higher burdens for living
alone at the moment (age r = -0.16), increased conflicts at home (age r = -0.11), switch
to digital media / teaching (age r = -0.14), home office (age r = -0.26), restrictions in
social life (r = -0.13) and cancellation of major events due to restrictions (r = -0.11). We
also observed higher values among younger individuals for the fear that someone close

In addition, significant negative correlation was observed between age of participants
and changes in daily rhythm, including change in working hours (r = -0.18), regularity of

meals (r = -0.19) and change in sleeping times (r = -0.20). Greater changes in daily
rhythm were also associated with higher PHQ-9 scores (change in working hours: r =

Moderately severe and severe depressive symptoms
(PHQ-9≥15): Comparison of socio-demographic factors before the
first pandemic wave and during the second pandemic wave
We compared the association of main socio-demographic factors (age, gender, prior
psychiatric disorder and canton) with the prevalence of high PHQ-9 scores (≥15) over
time, namely between reports from survey 1 before the first pandemic wave (February
2020) and reports from survey 3 during the second pandemic wave (November 2020).
For each factor, we tested for differential association between socio-demographic
characteristics and elevated PHQ-9 scores between the two time points (before the first
pandemic wave, during the second pandemic wave), either in terms of relative risk or in
terms of differences in prevalences.
Using a logit regression model, testing for multiplicative interaction between time point
and each factor, we identified significant interactions for prior psychiatric disorders (p =
​ ​
4.6e-14) and canton (p = 7.3e-04). Specifically, we observed that during the second
pandemic wave, the relative risk of elevated PHQ-9 score between participants
reporting existence of prior psychiatric disorder versus those not reporting any,
​ ​
suggests that even if history of prior psychiatric disorder is strongly associated with
elevated prevalence of PHQ-9 score ≥ 15 during the second pandemic wave, the
prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms is significantly increased as well in
participants not reporting any prior psychiatric disorder. Notably, in subjects not
reporting any prior psychiatric disorder, we observe during the second pandemic wave a
prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms (13%; CI: 12.1-13.9%) higher than the

disorder before the first pandemic wave (10%; CI: 8.5-11.6%); this difference is driven
​ ​
(OR) was identified.
We also compared differences in prevalences between socio-demographic factors over
time. Using a binomial linear regression model, we identified significant interactions of
time point with canton (FR minus IT: difference between November and February: 6.2%
CI: [4.2-8.2]%, p = 1.4e-9; FR minus GER: difference between November and February:
​ ​ ​
between age group and time points with notably increased differences between lower
age groups (14-24 and 25-34) and older age groups (45-54 and more) from February
​ ​ ​
Significant additive interaction was also observed between prior psychiatric disorder and
time points, with increased difference in prevalence between participants with or without
psychiatric disorder history from February to November (difference with prior psychiatric
disorder vs. others: 10.7% CI: 8.5-12.9%).
We performed a similar analysis considering profession rather than age. Using linear
binomial regression we identified significant interaction between profession and time
point. Notably, we observed a significant increase of the difference in prevalences
between students and - workers (7.6% CI: 5.3-9.8%, p = 4.6e-11) -
house-wives/husbands (9.8% CI: 6.7-12.9%, p = 3.4e-10) - retired (15.9% CI:
​ ​ ​
between workers or housewives/husbands and retired participants also significantly
increased from February to November (workers minus retired: 8.3% CI: 7.4-9.2%, p =
​ ​ ​
10-C). Finally, job seekers and participants in invalidity showed increased difference as
compared to retired participants from February to November (job seekers minus retired :
11.5% CI: 5.7-17.3%, p = 1.1e-04; in invalidity vs. retired: 11.5% CI: 1.2-21.8%, p =
​ ​
0.03), while no such difference was observed with other categories (p > 0.05). Yet in our
​ ​
The Swiss Corona Stress Study, second pandemic wave - v2020-12-16
studies these two groups (job seekers, in invalidity) include only a small number of
participants.
Overall, these results suggest that the differences in prevalence of moderately severe
and severe depressive symptoms, within age groups or professions, cantons, and
participants with or without prior disorder, significantly increased during the second
pandemic wave as compared to the time before the first pandemic wave.
Stress and depressive symptoms of survey 3: relation to
socio-demographic variables, changeable behaviors, burdens,

Obsessive compulsive symptoms of survey 3
34.7% reported more obsessive compulsive symptoms as compared to before the
pandemic (question ranged from 0 to 5). Within the 34.7% reporting increased
obsessive compulsive symptoms, the average increase was 2.2 (sd = 1.3). Participants
reporting more obsessive symptoms as compared to before the pandemic had
significantly more depressive symptoms (mean = 11.34, sd = 6.67) than participants

reporting an unchanged level of obsessive compulsive symptoms (mean = 6.50, sd =

Summary of results and conclusion
During the second pandemic wave in November 2020 stress has increased significantly
compared to the first wave. While the proportion of people reporting maximum stress
was around 11% during the April lockdown, it rose to 20% during the second wave in
November. The increase in stress was accompanied by an increase in depressive
symptoms.
The main drivers of psychological stress and depressive symptoms included exposure
to a Covid-19-related change in work, school, or education. Other factors included
stress from Covid-19-related financial losses and fears about the future. These
stressors have increased significantly, compared to the time of the April lockdown.
Further factors were the fear that someone in the closest circle would become seriously
ill or die from COVID-19, as well as the burden of social restrictions and stress from an
increase in conflict at home.
While the proportion of respondents with major depressive symptoms was 3% before
the pandemic (retrospective rating in survey 1), 9% during the April lockdown (survey
1), and 12% during the May (survey 2) lockdown period, it increased to 18% in
November (survey 3).
Particularly hard hit, were:
- Young people: the prevalence of moderately severe or severe (PHQ-9 ≥ 15)
depressive symptoms was 29% among 14-24 year olds, 21% among 25-34 year olds,
17% among 35-44 year olds, 14% among 45-54- year olds, 13% among 55-64 year
olds, and 6% among 65+ year olds.
The Swiss Corona Stress Study, second pandemic wave - v2020-12-16
- Individuals who worked in a business sector that was financially impacted due to
federal/cantonal measures (e.g., restaurant, culture, tourism). In addition, persons for
whom financial reserves have decreased were twice as likely to experience severe
depressive symptoms (28%) than persons with unchanged or increased reserves
(14%).
- Individuals from the French-speaking part of Switzerland were more affected, with a
frequency of severe depressive symptoms of 22%, than individuals from the
German-speaking part with 17%, or the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, with 16%.
In addition, we found a correlation between the strength of the second wave (incidence
of new infections) and the frequency of major depressive symptoms in the cantons.
As in previous surveys, we found that individuals who were physically active have, on
average, slightly lower levels of stress and depressive symptoms. The stress-reducing
effect of exercise is known from previous intervention studies.
Implications
Because young people are particularly vulnerable to the mental health effects of the
pandemic, schools should take this into account by being flexible with the curriculum.
The current data also show that Covid-19-related financial losses are a significant
psychological stressor. Compensating for these losses is thus important for mental
health.
