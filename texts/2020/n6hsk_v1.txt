Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses
Md Mahbub Hossain*,1 Abida Sultana,2 Qiping Fan,1 Ping Ma,1 Neetu Purohit3
ABSTRACT
Objective: Dating violence (DV) is a psychosocial problem which impacts the health and
wellbeing of affected individuals. Many studies have reported a high prevalence and various
determinants of DV; however, there is a gap of consolidated evidence on this problem. This
umbrella review aimed to synthesize the current evidence on the prevalence and determinants of
DV from systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
Methods: We systematically searched ten major databases and additional sources to retrieve
systematic reviews or meta-analyses reporting prevalence or determinants of DV, published as
peer-reviewed journal articles in English language till October 13, 2019. We extracted and
synthesized the findings, reported the prevalence of DV, and categorized the determinants of DV
using the socioecological model.
Results: We found 16 eligible systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Most of these studies were
conducted in developed countries with a majority of adolescent and young adult participants.
Studies reported varying prevalence of physical, sexual, psychological/emotional, and
technology-assisted DV ranging from 0.1% to 57.5%, 0.1% to 64.6%, 4.2% to 97%, and 5.8% to
92%, respectively. The determinants of DV at different socioecological levels, including
individual behavior, substance abuse, psychiatric conditions, experiencing violence and
maltreatment; interpersonal factors like family and peer relationships; community and
neighborhood characteristics; patriarchy, culture, and socioeconomic equalities were reported.
Conclusions: These findings suggest a high burden of DV among young populations, who are
vulnerable to various socioecological determinants of DV. Future research should examine how
these factors influence DV and multi-level interventions should be adopted to address the same.

Introduction
Dating violence (DV) is a psychosocial problem affecting the health and wellbeing of many
people around the world. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined DV as a
type of intimate partner violence occurring between two people in a close relationship (Center
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2019). Moreover, the United States (US) Department
of Justice defined DV as violence committed by an individual who is in a social relationship of a
romantic or intimate nature with the victim (The US Department of Justice, n.d.). Similar
definitions across different disciplines have conceptualized DV as interpersonal violence
including different acts of physical, sexual, or psychological aggression among dating or
unmarried romantic partners, who are involved in the mate-selection process (Jouriles, Garrido,
Rosenfield, & McDonald, 2009). Physical forms of DV include use of physical forces to cause
any form of harms to the target person in a dating relationship whereas sexual DV include
physical force to compel a person to engage in a sexual act, or engaging in sexual act in an
abusive manner, or involving the victim in a sexual act without willingness or ability to
understand the nature of the act (Breiding, Basile, Smith, Black, & Mahendra, 2015).
Furthermore, psychological or emotional DV involves acts, threats of acts, or coercive tactics,
which may include humiliation, control, isolation, or deliberate actions which may affect the
mental state of the victim (Breiding et al., 2015; WHO, 2012).
Different studies have revealed a varying prevalence of DV in different populations. A review of
studies conducted in the US has found estimates for dating violence perpetration ranging from
26% to 46% for physical violence and 3% to 12% for sexual violence (Hickman, Jaycox, &
Aronoff, 2004). Furthermore, a 10-year (1999–2009) National Teen DV Trend Study found
approximately 1 in 10 female adolescents (9.9% to 10.3%) and 1 in 8 male adolescents (9.1% to
Hossain et al. (2020) Prevalence and Determinants of Dating Violence
11.8%) reported experiencing physical DV in the past year (Howard, Debnam, & Wang, 2013;
Howard, Debnam, Wang, & Gilchrist, n.d.). Moreover, studies from other countries have shown
a high burden of DV. A study evaluated DV in samples from the UK and Spain found the
prevalence of DV victimization and perpetration as 23% and 30%, respectively (Viejo, Monks,
Sánchez, & Ortega-Ruiz, 2016). Another study conducted in Canada found more than 45% of the
study participants reported physical DV (Pedersen & Thomas, 1992). A high prevalence of DV
may have a wide range of negative health consequences. Victims of DV may have physical
trauma and a higher risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (Teitelman, Ratcliffe,
Dichter, & Sullivan, 2008), which may incur high socioeconomic burden. More importantly, DV
profoundly impacts the psychosocial processes and mental health of the victims (Temple et al.,
2016). Studies have shown high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities including depression,
anxiety, substance abuse, stress disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder among the victims of
DV (Burton, Halpern-Felsher, Rehm, Rankin, & Humphreys, 2016; Duerksen & Woodin, 2019;
Y. Park, Mulford, & Blachman-Demner, 2018). The long-term psychosocial outcomes of DV
may include fear to new relationship, difficulties in establishing meaningful communication,
social isolation, loneliness, and increased risks of subsequent DV victimization and perpetration
(Duerksen & Woodin, 2019; Y. Park et al., 2018).
To address the epidemiological and psychosocial challenges related to DV, it is essential to
understand the magnitude of the condition across different population groups. It may help in
identifying the high-risk groups and adopt preventive and therapeutic measures to alleviate the
burden of DV. Moreover, intrapersonal characteristics, interpersonal relationship dynamics, and
sociodemographic factors measures play a critical role in determining the burden of DV in any
given population (Foshee et al., 2008). Therefore, it is necessary to examine the determinants of
Hossain et al. (2020) Prevalence and Determinants of Dating Violence
DV to better understand the underlying factors associated with the burden of DV across diverse
population groups. Several reviews exist which reported either the prevalence or factors
associated with DV, but there is no review of the systematic reviews and meta-analyses offering
consolidated evidence on prevalence and determinants of DV. Considering there are about 11
systematic reviews published each day, there is a critical need for synthesizing evidence from
existing reviews and meta-research to advance knowledge and practice (Aromataris et al., 2015).
This umbrella review aims to synthesize the current evidence on the global prevalence and
determinants of DV from systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which may inform future
scientific, therapeutic, and policy discourses in DV.
Methods
Searching the Literature
To conduct this umbrella review, we used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Liberati et al., 2009) and the Joanna Briggs Institute
(JBI) methodology for umbrella reviews (Aromataris et al., 2015). We searched MEDLINE,
EMBASE, PubMed, Academic Search Ultimate, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Violence and Abuse
Abstracts, Health Source Nursing/Academic Edition, Health Policy Reference Center, and the
Cochrane Library to retrieve potential studies relevant to the objective of this umbrella review.
To identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses on prevalence and correlates of DV, use used
following search syntax: (“date violence” OR “date abuse” OR “date aggression” OR “dating
violence” OR “dating abuse” OR “dating aggression” OR “courtship violence” OR “courtship
abuse” OR “premarital abuse” OR “premarital violence” OR “premarital aggression”) AND
(prevalence OR incidence OR statistics OR epidemiology OR predictors OR correlates OR
determinants OR "risk factors" OR "associated factors" OR "factors associated" OR factors)
Hossain et al. (2020) Prevalence and Determinants of Dating Violence
AND ("systematic review" OR "meta-analysis" OR "pooled estimate" OR "pooled prevalence"
OR "pooled effect"). The keywords were used to search titles, abstracts, subject headings (like
MeSH), and general search terms. No language restriction was applied during database
searching. All the databases were searched since the inception of the respective databases. The
first search was conducted on August 27, 2019 and same search process was repeated on October
13, 2019, for the last time. In addition to database searching, we retrieved additional articles
through hand-searching violence and psychiatry-related journals and communicating with
subject-matter experts. Moreover, we used the “cited by” function in Google Scholar to check
the eligibility of the citing articles of the primarily screened articles. All the retrieved citations
were uploaded to RefWorks and Rayyan software for citation management and systematic
evaluation processes. After removing the duplicates, two authors independently evaluated the
titles and abstracts of the citations as per the selection criteria of our review. A third author was
consulted after the primary screening to confirm the eligibility of the included articles, resolve
the conflicts in the selection process, and reach a consensus about the finally recruited articles.
Selection Criteria
In this umbrella review, we included an article if it: a) was a systematically conducted literature
review or research synthesis using qualitative (meta-synthesis) or quantitative (meta-analysis)
approaches, b) primarily focused on any type of DV among partners in a dating or romantic
relationship, c) synthesized either the prevalence or correlates of DV from the primary studies in
respective reviews, d) included full-text in English, e) published as a journal article.
We excluded an article if it: a) was not a systematically conducted review (for example, non-
systematic literature reviews, overviews, primary articles, opinions, letters, editorials were
excluded), b) did not primarily focus on any form of DV in dating relationships (for example,
Hossain et al. (2020) Prevalence and Determinants of Dating Violence
reviews focusing on domestic or any other violence, or articles presenting dating violence with
other types of violence together were excluded), c) did not report either prevalence (including
incidence or proportion in a given population, if reported) or determinants (also can be termed as
correlates or associated factors in different methods and study designs) of DV synthesized from
primary articles, d) did not have the full-text in English, e) was not a journal article (for example,
dissertations, policy briefs, reports, book chapters were excluded).
Evaluation of the Methodological Quality of the Recruited Studies
Critical appraisal of the methodological quality of the recruited reviews is an essential process of
conducting an umbrella review (Aromataris et al., 2015). In this review, we evaluated the quality
of the systematic reviews and meta-analyses using the JBI critical appraisal checklist for
systematic reviews and research synthesis checklist. This checklist facilitates distinguishing the
quality of studies and decision-making about the recruitment of the articles. Moreover, this
checklist has ten items; each item can receive one point and the overall quality score of a study
can range from zero to ten. In this umbrella review, studies receiving zero to four, five to seven,
and eight to ten were categorized as low, medium, and high-quality studies, respectively.

Data Extraction and Synthesis
A codebook for extracting quantitative and qualitative data was prepared using the JBI data
extraction tool for systematic reviews and research synthesis (Munn, Tufanaru, & Aromataris,
2014). Details on the authors, year of publication, characteristics of the review studies, origin and
types of the primary studies in each review, sample size and characteristics of the study
population, and key findings on prevalence, determinants, correlates, or associated factors of DV
were extracted by two authors and reviewed by a third author. The extracted data were
narratively synthesized to present the characteristics of the review studies and the findings
meeting the objective of this study. Prevalence data were presented as pooled estimates from
meta-analysis, as reported in narrative reviews. Moreover, determinants, correlates or factors
associated with DV were extracted and evaluated using socioecological model of McLeroy and
colleagues (Mcleroy, Bibeau, Steckler, & Glanz, 1988). Using this approach, different variables
associated with DV were categorized as individual, interpersonal, community, social, and
systems-level determinants of DV. Qualitative or narrative findings were presented as they were
reported in the respective reviews, whereas quantitative data were presented with the range of
rates within 95% confidence interval (CI), wherever reported.
Results
We found 1119 citations from database searching and 416 citations from additional sources,
totaling 1535 citations. After removing the duplicates, screening the titles/abstracts, and
evaluating the full texts, we found 16 articles that met our criteria (Caridade, Braga, & Borrajo,

of the studies were published since 2017. The number of primary studies within those reviews
ranged from 13 to 113, and the sample sizes ranged from 24 to 85,198. While most participants
across all the studies were adolescents, four reviews (Spencer et al., 2019; Taquette & Maia
Monteiro, 2019; Wincentak et al., 2017; Zych et al., 2019) exclusively recruited primary studies
with adolescent participants, whereas remaining reviews recruited studies comprising
adolescents, young adults, and participants of other age groups. Most primary studies in all the
reviews were conducted in the US and Canada; however, four reviews included primary studies
conducted in different states of the US only (Duval et al., 2018; Johnson et al., 2017, 2015;
Spencer et al., 2019). Very few primary studies were reported from low- and middle-income
countries.

For example, among 87 studies included in a meta-analysis by He’bert and colleagues, only two
primary studies were from India and El Salvador (Hébert et al., 2019). Most of the studies (n =
11) (Duval et al., 2018; Garthe et al., 2017; Hébert et al., 2019; Johnson et al., 2017; S. Park &
Kim, 2018, 2019; Rothman et al., 2012; Spencer et al., 2019; Stonard et al., 2014; Wincentak et
al., 2017; Zych et al., 2019) included in this umbrella review had high quality whereas remaining
(n = 5) (Caridade et al., 2019; Johnson et al., 2015; Joly & Connolly, 2016; Rubio-Garay et al.,
2017; Taquette & Maia Monteiro, 2019) studies had medium quality as per the JBI quality
appraisal checklist (Appendix 1).
Prevalence of DV
Physical DV. Studies have reported a varying prevalence of physical DV. Stonard and
colleagues reported the prevalence ranging from 5% to 30% and 10% to 30% for physical DV
perpetration and victimization, respectively (Stonard et al., 2014). Another systematic review by
Rubio-Garay and colleagues reported the rates of physical DV perpetration and victimization,
ranging from 3.8% to 41.9% and 0.4% to 57.5%, respectively (Rubio-Garay et al., 2017). Two
meta-analyses reported the pooled prevalence of Physical DV (Joly & Connolly, 2016;
Wincentak et al., 2017). In the meta-analysis by Joly and colleagues, 34% (95% CI: 24%-45%)
participants experienced physical DV, whereas 45% (95% CI: 31%-61%) participants
perpetrated physical violence in their dating relationships (Joly & Connolly, 2016). Another
meta-analysis of 96 studies found the overall prevalence of reported physical DV was 20% (95%
CI: 17%-23%) (Wincentak et al., 2017).
Sexual DV. A meta-analysis by Wincentak and colleagues found the prevalence of sexual DV as
9% (95% CI: 5%-14%) (Wincentak et al., 2017). Moreover, Duval and colleagues reported
43.3% of men claimed to perpetrate sexual DV, whereas 50.4% of women reported being a
Hossain et al. (2020) Prevalence and Determinants of Dating Violence
victim of sexual DV (Duval et al., 2018). Stonard and colleagues found the rates of sexual DV
perpetration and victimization ranging from 5% to 20% and 5% to 30% respectively (Stonard et
al., 2014). Furthermore, Rubio-Garay and colleagues reported 1.2% to 58.8% of participants
perpetrated sexual DV whereas 0.1% to 64.6% reported being victims of sexual DV (Rubio-
Garay et al., 2017).
Psychological and Emotional DV. Studies have also evaluated the prevalence of psychological
and emotional DV (Rubio-Garay et al., 2017; Stonard et al., 2014). Stonard and colleagues found
35% to 55% of participants reported psychological or emotional DV victimization whereas 20%
to 70% reported perpetration of such violence (Stonard et al., 2014). Another review by Rubio-
Garay and colleagues revealed the prevalence of psychological DV victimization and
perpetration ranging from 8.5% to 95.5% and 4.2% to 97% respectively (Rubio-Garay et al.,
2017).
Other Forms of DV. In addition to the above-mentioned typologies, DV is also reported to
happen in digital platforms. Stonard and colleagues found the prevalence of technology-assisted
DV perpetration ranged from 12% to 54% whereas victimization ranged from 12% to 56%
among the study participants (Stonard et al., 2014). DV in the digital era was also evaluated by
Caridade and colleagues who found the prevalence of cyber dating abuse perpetration ranging
from 8.1% to 93.7% and victimization ranging from 5.8% to 92% (Caridade et al., 2019).
Determinants of DV
Individual-level determinants. Several determinants of DV were reported across studies that
may influence the perpetration or victimization of DV among the individuals. Personality and
behavioral attributes like low esteem (Taquette & Maia Monteiro, 2019), bullying (Caridade et
Hossain et al. (2020) Prevalence and Determinants of Dating Violence
al., 2019; Zych et al., 2019), narcissism vulnerability (Caridade et al., 2019), grandiosity
(Caridade et al., 2019), and controlling behavior (Spencer et al., 2019) were found to be
associated with DV. Moreover, alcoholism and other forms of substance abuse were associated
with DV (Caridade et al., 2019; Duval et al., 2018; Johnson et al., 2017, 2015; Joly & Connolly,
2016; Rothman et al., 2012; Spencer et al., 2019; Taquette & Maia Monteiro, 2019). For
example, a meta-analysis by Rothman and colleagues reported higher odds ratio (OR) of DV
perpetration for heavy episodic drinking (OR 1.47, 95%CI: 1.17-1.85), problematic use (OR
2.33, 95%CI: 1.94-2.8), and frequency/quantity of drinking (OR 1.23, 95%CI: 1.16-1.31)
(Rothman et al., 2012). Furthermore, psychiatric disorders like depression, suicidal ideation, and
posttraumatic stress disorder were associated with DV perpetration and victimization (Caridade
et al., 2019; Joly & Connolly, 2016; Spencer et al., 2019; Taquette & Maia Monteiro, 2019). In
addition, poor educational attainment (S. Park & Kim, 2018), high-risk sexual behavior
(Caridade et al., 2019; Duval et al., 2018; Spencer et al., 2019; Taquette & Maia Monteiro,
2019), and belonging to vulnerable groups like teenage mothers (Joly & Connolly, 2016) were
associated with DV. Also, previous exposure to any forms of violence, including childhood
abuse or domestic violence, was associated with DV perpetration and victimization (Caridade et
al., 2019; Duval et al., 2018; S. Park & Kim, 2018, 2019; Spencer et al., 2019; Zych et al., 2019).
For example, a meta-analysis by Park and Kim revealed that participants who experienced
violence earlier were more likely to perpetrate or become the victims of DV (S. Park & Kim,
2019). While most of the determinants were reported as risk factors for DV, individual
characteristics like self-control (Hébert et al., 2019) and conflict resolution skills (Spencer et al.,
2019) have been reported as protective factors against DV.
Hossain et al. (2020) Prevalence and Determinants of Dating Violence
Interpersonal determinants. Interpersonal relationships and interactions have been considered as
critical elements in DV studies. The characteristics of the peers and the quality of interactions
with them are found as major determinants of DV (Duval et al., 2018; Garthe et al., 2017; Hébert
et al., 2019; Joly & Connolly, 2016; S. Park & Kim, 2018, 2019; Spencer et al., 2019; Zych et
al., 2019). For example, a meta-analysis by Garthe and colleagues reported peers’ aggressive or
antisocial behavior (r = .20), peer DV (r = .30), and being victimized by peers (r = .22) were
significantly associated with DV perpetration and victimization (Garthe et al., 2017). Moreover,
family structure and relationships were associated with DV among children, adolescents, and
young adults (Joly & Connolly, 2016; S. Park & Kim, 2018; Spencer et al., 2019; Taquette &
Maia Monteiro, 2019). For example, the meta-analysis by Park and Kim found that several
family factors predicted DV, among which “witnessing parental violence” was the strongest risk
factor of DV victimization (S. Park & Kim, 2018). In contrast, parent support (Hébert et al.,
2019) and relationship quality with parents (Spencer et al., 2019) were protective factors against
DV.
Community-level level determinants. Studies found that community and neighborhood
characteristics often influence DV perpetration and victimization (Johnson et al., 2015; Joly &
Connolly, 2016; Wincentak et al., 2017). Johnson and colleagues found neighborhood disorder,
disorganization, demographic and structural challenges, and residence characteristics were
associated with DV perpetration but not with victimization (Johnson et al., 2015). A meta-
analysis Joly and colleagues (Joly & Connolly, 2016) reported negative neighborhood experience
was associated with DV whereas samples from disadvantaged neighborhoods had higher
physical DV is a meta-analysis conducted by Wincentak and colleagues (Wincentak et al., 2017).
Hossain et al. (2020) Prevalence and Determinants of Dating Violence
Social and systems-level determinants. Several social and systems-level determinants of DV
were reported across studies. Social norms like patriarchal social structure (Taquette & Maia
Monteiro, 2019) and legitimacy of DV by boys (Caridade et al., 2019) were associated with DV.
Moreover, social structures, institutions, and practices were associated with power imbalance and
vulnerability to DV (Johnson et al., 2015; Joly & Connolly, 2016; Taquette & Maia Monteiro,
2019; Wincentak et al., 2017). For example, moderator analyses in the meta-analysis by
Wincentak and colleagues found samples with socioeconomically disadvantaged and cultural
minority girls had higher rates of physical DV (Wincentak et al., 2017). Moreover, Joly and
colleagues found participants in the juvenile justice system were more vulnerable to DV (Joly &
Connolly, 2016). Furthermore, Taquette and colleagues reported social and systems-level
determinants like culture, racism, sexism, and poverty were associated with DV perpetration and
victimization (Taquette & Maia Monteiro, 2019).
Discussion
This umbrella review evaluated the current evidence on the prevalence and determinants of DV
from published systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The findings suggest a high burden of
different forms of DV perpetration and victimization across different population groups. In
addition, the determinants of DV at different levels of the socioecological model inform how
individual, interpersonal, community, social and systems-level factors may influence DV among
the study participants. These findings offer several critical insights about DV, which are essential
for future research, policy development, and practice.
Hossain et al. (2020) Prevalence and Determinants of Dating Violence
First, the reported prevalence of DV may provide a sub-optimal picture of the actual burden. A
possible reason for this may be under-reporting due to stigma and other psychosocial barriers
perceived by the affected individuals (Foshee et al., 2008; Hickman et al., 2004; Temple et al.,
2016). Healthcare professionals, social workers, legal service providers, and other stakeholders
in health and social care should provide support and create an enabling environment that helps
the victims to report the cases of DV (Hickman et al., 2004; Y. Park et al., 2018). Another reason
may be attributable to the definitions and constructs of DV across studies published from
different disciplines. Differences in operational definitions of DV and methods to measure the
same may contribute to heterogeneity in estimating the problems and factors associated with DV
(Stonard et al., 2014). Future scientific discourses should standardize the definitions and
methods, which may facilitate more accurate estimations of the prevalence and determinants of
DV.
Second, most of the study participants in the primary studies of the included reviews were
adolescents and young adults. A high prevalence of DV among this young population illustrates
profound mental health implications. Moreover, DV was found to be associated with behavioral
abnormalities, alcoholism and substance abuse, and several psychiatric comorbidities (Burton et
al., 2016; Duerksen & Woodin, 2019; Y. Park et al., 2018; Taquette & Maia Monteiro, 2019).
This may create a complex scenario of psychiatric multimorbidity among individuals who
perpetrate or experience DV. Identifying such cases and addressing the same with multipronged
mental health services can be difficult. Mental health researchers and practitioners may consider
future research and collaborative actions to better understand such psychosocial complexities
associated with DV, which may help in understanding and managing such problems.
Hossain et al. (2020) Prevalence and Determinants of Dating Violence
Third, most primary studies in this review were conducted in the US, Canada, and countries with
similar socioeconomic contexts. A lack of published studies from resource-constrained countries
indicates substantial gaps in the research activities or publications in this domain. This appears to
be paradoxical as many low- and middle-income countries have a high burden of child marriage
and gender-based violence. It is difficult to say whether the concept of dating violence is not yet
established in those contexts, or the dominant paradigm of violence research is concentrated on
gender-based violence in those countries. However, very few studies from developing countries
have shown a similar burden of DV in those contexts highlighting prospects for future research.
Moreover, with demographic and epidemiological transitions in those countries, many people are
having increased life expectancy and getting married at a later age, which is contributing to a
reduction in child marriage in many countries (Das Gupta et al., 2014). Therefore, a larger
proportion of the adolescent and young adult population who are unmarried, may get involved in
dating relationships. Given the existence of the determinants of DV revealed in this review, those
individuals may experience DV in their dating relationships, which is essential to be measured,
prevented, and treated, whenever it occurs.
Fourth, the emergence of technology-assisted or cyber DV in recent years is a major mental
health concern. With the rapidly increasing number of people using gadgets and having access to
the internet may contribute to the growing burden of such violence among people who share the
psycho-epidemiological characteristics of DV perpetration or victimization. The similarities and
differences of such cases with other forms of DV may help in understanding the phenomenology
of DV in the era of digital technologies and address the same. Moreover, higher access to
technologies also offers unique opportunities to use such platforms for delivering interventions
promoting awareness and preventing DV (Draucker et al., 2019; O’Brien, Sauber, Kearney,
Hossain et al. (2020) Prevalence and Determinants of Dating Violence
Venaglia, & Lemay, 2019), which should be evaluated before large-scale adoption of such
approaches.
Lastly, different determinants of DV at multiple levels of the socioecological model inform the
complexities among the levels and how they affect DV among the individuals. Risk factors
identified at the individual level can help in improving the existing guidelines and approaches to
diagnose or predict the potential cases of DV. Moreover, individual characteristics may be
helpful in designing more personalized care for DV-affected people. Also, interpersonal factors
like peer and family relationships highlight the role of dyadic interactions on the psychosocial
wellbeing of the individuals. It is essential to consider critical factors like deviant peers or
negative family relationships in DV research and practice to alleviate the burden of DV. In
addition, community-level characteristics like neighborhood problems may necessitate a multi-
sectoral and participatory approach involving community members, planners, social workers,
development organizations, and other stakeholders to identify the prevalent causes of DV in the
community settings. Furthermore, social and systems-level determinants inform the macro-
environmental attributes of DV, which should be addressed in a collective manner. For example,
educational institutions are part of the social system, which may play critical roles in delivering
interventions preventing DV (Carlos et al., 2017). Such opportunities should be explored, and
future interventions should incorporate behavior change constructs considering diverse social
and institutional factors, which may increase awareness about DV and prevent the same at the
population-level. Nevertheless, social challenges including racism, sexism, impaired health
rights in juvenile justice systems, and structural inequalities should be carefully examined and
addressed at policy level to prevent the DV epidemic, as those issues continue to affect the
mental state of people.
Hossain et al. (2020) Prevalence and Determinants of Dating Violence
This review has several limitations, which should be acknowledged. Although we searched
major databases, but there may be additional literature which we could not evaluate in this
review. Another limitation can be the publication bias. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
with insignificant findings may not have been published, which remain beyond the scope of our
review. Moreover, we included studies that explicitly focused on DV. Studies focusing on
domestic or gender-based or intimate partner violence were excluded from this review. Those
studies may have included DV-related information, which may have provided different insights
into this area. Furthermore, we categorized the determinants using the socioecological model. In
this process, one determinant may have appeared at multiple levels. For example, previous
experience of violence was reported at the individual level, whereas violence at peer or family
relationships was reported at the interpersonal level. Such overarching and interconnected factors
should be deeply investigated in case of DV to address the problems. Lastly, we did not compare
individual primary studies and kept the scope of our review within the reviews and meta-
analyses. An in-depth and different organization of individual studies may have considered the
in-between studies offering different understanding than an umbrella review approach. However,
we conducted this review using state-of-the-art guidelines, and each step of the review process
was conducted by more than two authors to minimize biases. Future research should address our
limitations and advance the evidence base on DV.
Conclusion
This umbrella review synthesized the current evidence on the prevalence and determinants of
DV from systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This evidence provides an overall understanding
of DV among the study populations. A high prevalence and various socioecological determinants
Hossain et al. (2020) Prevalence and Determinants of Dating Violence
of DV may inform the development and implementation of policies and interventions to address
DV across populations. Also, the research gaps found in the existing literature may inform
prospective measures to advance the existing knowledge base. The collective insights of this
umbrella review should be used to promote better research and evidence-based approaches
preventing DV among people who are or will be in dating relationships.
Critical findings of this umbrella review:
1. This review identified 16 eligible systematic reviews and meta-analyses reporting the
prevalence and determinant of DV.
2. In the included reviews, most of the primary studies were conducted in developed
countries, and the majority of the participants were adolescents and young adults
3. Studies reported varying prevalence of physical, sexual, psychological/emotional, and
technology-assisted DV ranging from 0.1% to 57.5%, 0.1% to 64.6%, 4.2% to 97%, and
5.8% to 92%, respectively.
4. The socioecological determinants of DV included individual behavior, substance abuse,
psychiatric conditions, experiencing violence and maltreatment; interpersonal factors like
family and peer relationships; community and neighborhood characteristics; patriarchy,
culture, and socioeconomic equalities.

Implications on Practice, Research, and Policy
To the best of our knowledge, this umbrella review is the first one to examine the consolidated
evidence on the prevalence and determinants of DV. This review found a high prevalence and
diverse socioecological determinants of DV, which may have following implications for
practice, research, and policy:
1. Evidence synthesized in this review provide insights on the severity and determinants of
DV, which inform how different populations at-risk should be targeted for evidence-
based preventive measures.
2. An understanding of socioecological determinants may allow the development and
implementation of interventions improving behavioral and psychiatric conditions of the
individuals, and enhancing the nature and quality of family and peer relationships
3. Policies and programs should be adopted to improve the neighborhood characteristics,
address cultural disparities, and alleviate social inequalities, which may contribute to a
long-term prevention of DV in a given population.
4. The gaps in the existing literature and limitations of this review necessitate future studies
and evidence synthesis to better understand DV and associated factors in diverse
population group to strengthen the evidence base and inform better policies and practices.
