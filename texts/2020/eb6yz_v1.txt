48 Abstract
49 An underlying concern about the COVID-19 pandemic is that the mental health of children
50 will decline. The present study aimed to investigate whether a single school-based
51 intervention, including self-monitoring and psychoeducation for COVID-19, effectively
52 achieved its aim to promote children’s mental health. The study was conducted in a junior
53 high school. We assigned the third grade as the intervention group, second grade as the
54 announcement group, and first grade, the control group. We hypothesized that the
55 intervention group would experience improved mental health and reduced fear of COVID-19,
56 when compared to the announcement and control groups. Interaction effects were observed
57 only for depression, indicating a significant intervention effect in the intervention group.
58 These findings suggest that a single school-based intervention that includes self-monitoring
59 and psychoeducation for COVID-19 can help to improve children’s mental health. It is
60 suggested that school-based interventions that intend to raise children's awareness of COVID-
61 19 promote healthy development and adaptation within the school.

65 Health
66 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 is a pandemic. As of
67 December 14, 2020, there were 70,461,926 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1,599,704
68 deaths including children, worldwide (WHO, 2020). The spread of infections has restricted
69 our behavioral patterns and usual functioning. Moreover, these restrictions have hampered
70 children's school life, depriving them of learning and communication with friends and
71 teachers. Despite situational limitations, teachers have made massive efforts to conduct
72 online lessons and prepared to reopen schools. Although the number of infected people
73 decreased in Japan and most schools reopened, the fear of infection still demanded the
74 practice of social distancing, using personal protective equipment and avoiding the “Three
75 Cs” : 1. Closed spaces with insufficient ventilation, 2. Crowded conditions with people, 3.
76 Conversations in short distance (Prime Minister’s Office of Japan & Ministry of Health,
77 Labour and Welfare, 2020).
78 Although these restrictions helped mitigate the spread of this disease, people
79 continued to experience fear, uncertainty, and physical distress. The infection is an invisible
80 threat like chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high‐yield explosives, and causes
81 various stresses adding to the fear of infection (Shigemura et al., 2020). Review has reported
82 that longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies,
IMPACT OF SINGLE SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTION 6
83 inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma cause negative psychological effects,
84 including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger (Brooks et al., 2020). These
85 stresses cause characteristic responses in children different from that in adult presentations,
86 for example trauma expression in play and restless behavior at school (Roccella, 2020),
87 which vary in their degree of severity. Furthermore, children and adolescents who experience
88 disasters may suffer from greater stress and trauma because they are psychologically,
89 physically, and educationally more vulnerable than adults (Peek, 2008; Roussos et al., 2005).
90 Therefore, it is necessary to educate children under the pandemic to prevent their mental
91 health from deteriorating.
92 The school system is increasingly being used as a locus to promote prevention efforts
93 for mental health improvement, the underlying assumption being that adopting evidence-
94 based programs will result in positive outcomes (Flaspohler et al., 2012). There is strong
95 evidence that mental health promotion programs in schools lead to positive mental health and
96 educational outcomes (Tennant et al., 2007; Weare & Nind, 2011). School-based intervention
97 is cost-effective in that it can provide a school time for the prevention to a large number of
98 students (Griffin & Botvin, 2010; Caulkins et al., 2002). These benefits have been estimated
99 to exceed costs in most intervention aspects (Throuvala et al., 2019). Schools need to
100 improve the mental health of children by helping them build resilience and minimize the risk
101 of long-lasting trauma (Capurso et al., 2020). Importantly, it is highly effective to provide
IMPACT OF SINGLE SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTION 7
102 psychological care concerning COVID-19 for children in a school system.
103 For school-based interventions, it is desirable to provide psychoeducation on the stress
104 of the infection. Children may benefit from supportive interventions, such as
105 psychoeducation or cognitive-behavioral techniques designed to promote wellness and
106 enhance coping (Pfefferbaum & North, 2020). Psychoeducation can help individuals
107 understand their own physical and emotional reactions and identify when to seek additional
108 support (Marques et al., 2020). Psychoeducation is an evidence-based approach to enhance
109 children’s insight to reduce stigma and worries regarding infection (Halder, 2020). School-
110 based psychoeducation will have a positive impact on children, enabling them to deal
111 effectively with various stresses caused by diseases.
112 The present study aimed to investigate whether the single school-based
113 intervention effectively achieved its aims of promoting children’s mental health and
114 reducing the fear of COVID-19. We hypothesized that the intervention group would
115 improve mental health and reduce the fear of COVID-19 compared to the other
116 groups. Consequently, we sought to find whether including psychoeducation for
117 COVID-19 would be impactful (or highly effective) as this program imparted
118 knowledge (or increased awareness) about the infection and ways to deal with stress.
119 Method
120 Participants
IMPACT OF SINGLE SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTION 8
121 Participants were students from the first grade to third grade, all from a junior high school
122 in Japan. The first grade consisted of 38 boys and 40 girls; the second grade, 50 boys and 35
123 girls and the third grade, 38 boys and 40 girls.
124 Procedure
125 Participants were divided into three groups for each grade: the first grade was the control group;
126 the second grade, the announcement group; and the third grade, the intervention group. The
127 intervention was performed on July 21, 2020, in a junior high school in Japan. All students
128 completed outcome measures at baseline (Time 1) and endline (Time 2), before and after, nearly,
129 a month of summer vacation. At Time 1, on July 17, there were approximately 23,029 people
130 infected and 984 related deaths from COVID-19 in Japan; at Time 2, on August 25, there were
131 approximately 63,121 people infected and 1,196 related deaths from COVID-19 in Japan. The
132 intervention was conducted per class for third grade students as a lesson in the school
133 curriculum. On the same day, an announcement about COVID-19 was made for the entire
134 second grade at a term-end rally. First grade students did not receive the intervention at that
135 time. However, after this study, the first and second grade students received a program
136 equivalent to the intervention. This study was conducted in cooperation with the Board of
137 Education and the School Principal, and approved by the Ethics Committee of Iryo Sosei
138 University (# 20–02).

140 Intervention
141 The intervention program for third grade students consisted of 50-min session, delivered
142 as a whole-class intervention to limit disrupting the curriculum. The therapist was the first
143 author, who is a licensed clinical psychologist to administer psychological assessment and
144 cognitive behavioral therapy in school.
145 The intervention consisted of a 15-min self-monitoring session and a 35-min
146 psychoeducation session. In the self-monitoring session, the students learned about the effects
147 of stress on mental health and how to identify their thoughts, feelings, physical responses,
148 and actions under the COVID-19 pandemic. They wrote these psychological responses on a
149 paper and shared them with their classmates in as much detail as possible. During the
150 psychoeducation session, using teaching materials provided by the Japanese Red Cross
151 Society (Japanese Red Cross Society, 2020), the students learned about three different “faces
152 (sickness, stigma, fear)” of COVID-19, which have adversely affected our lives, and how to
153 cope with each of these.
154 An announcement for second grade students informed them that stress associated with
155 this pandemic affects mental health. This announcement was included in the 50-min lecture
156 on how to spend their summer vacation at school, which was made by the therapist in 15 out
157 of the 50 min.
158 Measures
IMPACT OF SINGLE SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTION 10
159 DSRS-C
160 The Birleson Depression Self-Rating Scale for Children (DSRS-C; Birleson, 1981)
161 was used to assess depressive symptoms. In this study, we used the Japanese version of the
162 DSRS-C, validated by Murata et al. (1996), with sufficient reliability. The DSRS-C consists
163 of 18 items for evaluating depression in children designed as a self-report questionnaire about
164 their state during the past week using a 3-point scale ranging from 0 (never) to 2 (always);
165 higher scores on the DSRS-C indicated more depressive symptoms. All items showed high
166 internal consistency at Time 1 (α =.852, ω = .852) and Time 2 (α = .870, ω = .862).
167 Fear of COVID-19 Scale
168 The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S; Ahorsu et al., 2020) was used to assess the
169 fear of COVID-19 among the students. In this study, we used the Japanese version of FCV-
170 19S (FCV-19S-J), validated by Masuyama et al. (2020), with sufficient reliability. The FCV-
171 19S-J consists of seven items. Participants responded to each item on a 4-point scale ranging
172 from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). A higher score indicated a greater fear of
173 COVID-19. In this study, the total score of all items was used in the analysis. All items
174 showed high internal consistency at Time 1 (α = .836, ω = .856) and Time 2 (α = .859, ω
175 = .884).
176 The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children-Trait
177 The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children-Trait (STAI-CH-T; Spielberger et al.,
IMPACT OF SINGLE SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTION 11
178 1973) questionnaire was used to assess trait anxiety. In this study, we used the Japanese
179 version of the STAI-CH-T, as its validity has previously been verified in children (Soga et al.,
180 1983). Trait anxiety is defined as an individual’s tendency to react in an anxious way,
181 regardless of the situation (Guinot et al., 2011; Jimeno et al., 2011). The STAI-CH-T scale
182 consists of 20 statements, and the participants responded to the STAI-CH-T statements using
183 a 3-point rating scale (1 = hardly ever to 3 = often); higher scores indicated greater trait
184 anxiety. All items showed high internal consistency at Time 1 (α = .914, ω = .917) and Time 2
185 (α = .916, ω = .919).
186 Data Analysis
187 We first studied whether there was any significant baseline difference among the
188 three groups, using a separate ANOVA for continuous variables. Next, we compared
189 differences in changes of outcome scores among the three groups, using repeated-measures
190 ANOVA (Time 1 vs. Time 2). The software used for the analyses was HAD (Shimizu, 2016).
191 Statistical significance was determined at p < .05.
192 Results
193 Preliminary analysis
194 Means, standard deviations, and range of scores for the variables at T1 and T2 are
196 differences in pre-intervention means across conditions on the FCV-19S-J, F(2,237) = 2.00, p
IMPACT OF SINGLE SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTION 12
197 = .137. There were, however, significant differences for DSRS-C, F(2,233) = 8.11, p = .000,
198 in the lower baseline scores for the control group than for the intervention and announcement
199 group, and for STAI-CH-T, F(2,232) = 4.19, p = .016, in the higher baseline scores for the
200 announcement group than for the controlled group.
202 Main analysis
204 repeated-measures ANOVA for DSRS-C indicated a significant main effect of group (F(2,228) =
205 6.375, p = .002), but not time (F(2,228) = 0.870, p = .352), and a significant group × time
206 interaction (F(2,228)=3.195, p = .043). The results of multiple comparisons demonstrated that the
207 students in the intervention group showed significantly fewer depressive symptoms than either
208 the announcement group or the control group between Time 1 and Time 2.
210 measures ANOVA for FCV-19S-J indicated a significant main effect of time (F(1,231) = 13.902,
211 p = .000), but not group (F(2,231) = 2.805, p = .063), and no significant group × time interaction
212 (F(2,231)=0.227, p = .797).
214 repeated-measures ANOVA for STAI-CH-T indicated a significant main effect of group
215 (F(2,216) = 5.081, p = .007), but not time (F(1,216) = .000, p = .991), and no significant group ×
216 time interaction (F(2,216)=0.014, p = .986).

217 Discussion
218 The present study aimed to investigate whether the single school-based intervention
219 effectively achieved its aims to promote children’s mental health and reduce the fear of
220 COVID-19. It was hypothesized that the intervention group would improve mental health and
221 experience reduced fear of COVID-19 compared to the announcement and control group. As
222 a result, the intervention was effective in preventing depression. Consistent with previous
223 studies of school-based intervention (Tennant et al., 2007; Weare & Nind, 2011), our
224 intervention at the school resulted in mental health promotion. We considered that self-
225 monitoring and psychoeducation allowed students to re-examine their mental state and
226 develop the confidence to attend school, based on their newly acquired knowledge of coping
227 with COVID-19, which led to desired results. The school-based intervention on COVID-19 is
228 particularly novel for interventions aimed at improving mental health. These results suggest
229 that a single school-based intervention for COVID-19 can have some short-term benefits
230 under real-school conditions.
231 The lack of a significant effect on trait anxiety, however, was inconsistent with our
232 hypotheses. This could be because this simple intervention was limited by time constraints, to
233 improve trait anxiety. Previous studies on interventions for trait anxiety with a higher number
234 of sessions showed its significant reduction (Muris et al., 2001; Muris et al., 2002; Pedro-
235 Carroll & Cowen, 1985). Therefore, it is expected that significant changes will be obtained
IMPACT OF SINGLE SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTION 14
236 by increasing the number of sessions.
237 In our study, a significant intervention effect on fear of COVID-19 was unobtained, even
238 though psychoeducation was expected to increase awareness of coping with the stress of
239 COVID-19. Contrarily, all groups showed a significant reduction in fear of COVID-19 after
240 approximately one month of summer vacation. In Japan, there were many restrictions on
241 attending school until May 2020, following which it became possible to go to school, as
242 before, by paying attention to infection prevention. Reasonably, it is assumed that as a result
243 of adapting to fear over time, rather than the efficacy of the intervention, there was no
244 significant observable effect of the intervention.
245 Limitations
246 This study had several limitations. First, we did not use randomization sampling, which is
247 useful to devise measurements so that variables, including age, are not different at the
248 baseline. Second, we measured only fear as COVID-19-related stress. It is necessary to
249 investigate the effects of interventions on specific stresses, such as refraining from being
250 outdoors and limiting physical distance to clarify COVID-19-related stress for children.
251 Third, this study examined the effect of a single intervention. Further research is needed to
252 understand how this effect can be strengthened and maintained at follow-up.
253 Conclusion
254 The present study aimed to investigate whether the single school-based intervention
IMPACT OF SINGLE SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTION 15
255 effectively achieved its aims of promoting children’s mental health and reducing fear of
256 COVID-19. As a result, the intervention proved effective in preventing depression, though
257 not for trait anxiety and fear of COVID-19. This study suggests that school-based
258 intervention on COVID-19 improves children’s health promotion by allowing them the
259 opportunity to re-examine their mental state and develop the confidence to live a regular
260 school life based on their awareness of COVID-19.
