RUNNING HEAD: Schizotypy & pattern separation/false memory
Abstract
Tendency to experience inaccurate beliefs alongside perceptual anomalies constitutes positive
schizotypal traits in the general population and shows continuity with the positive symptoms of
schizophrenia. It has been hypothesized that the positive symptomatology of schizophrenia, and by
extension, the odd beliefs and unusual perceptual experiences in the general population, are associated
with specific alterations in memory functions. Imbalance between memory generalization and episodic
memory specificity has been proposed on several counts; however, the direction of the imbalance is
currently unclear. Here, we evaluated the association between positive schizotypy, and memory
alterations related to hippocampal computations in a general population sample enriched for positive
schizotypy. We found that memory generalization is attenuated while memory specificity is elevated in
participants with more pronounced positive schizotypal traits. Our findings show that people who are
prone to irrational beliefs and unusual experiences also show measurable alterations in memory and
likely have difficulty grasping the global picture and rather be overpowered by fragments of information.

RUNNING HEAD: Schizotypy & pattern separation/false memory
1. Introduction
Schizotypal personality traits have been conceptualized to form a continuum with symptoms of
schizophrenia [1] which is evidenced by marked phenomenological and cognitive overlaps [1, 2] and
higher transition probability of people with more pronounced schizotypal traits into psychosis [3]. While
schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder with a prevalence rate of under 1% [4], schizotypal
traits represent a mild analogue of the symptoms of schizophrenia and form part of the natural variation
of personality traits in the general population [1, 3, 5]. Schizotypy comprises multiple dimensions, one
of which is positive schizotypy, that implies odd, delusion-like beliefs, and unusual, hallucination-like
experiences [1].
It has been suggested that the positive symptoms of schizophrenia are related to specific learning
and memory alterations [6] implying that people who are prone to irrational beliefs and unusual
perceptions may also demonstrate distinct alterations in memory functions. There is a discrepancy in the
literature, however, regarding how positive symptoms are related to such alterations in memory.
According to Tamminga and colleagues, the positive symptomatology of schizophrenia is linked to the
imbalance of hippocampal neural computations [7, 8]. The hippocampus is a medial temporal lobe
structure that is associated with episodic memory [9] and is assumed to play a leading role in memory
specificity and generalization [10]. Memories are likely to overlap with each other in content which
hinders the retrieval of unique memories. Storing specific details in the face of significant overlap
between memory representations is carried out by pattern separation, a neural computation in the
hippocampus. As a result of pattern separation, the neuronal activities of brain circuits become distinct
for two or more stimuli that share similar features [11, 12]. On the other hand, the unification of related
memory elements into an integrated unit is attributed to the neural computation of pattern completion.
Pattern completion relies on an autoassociative network in the hippocampus that fills in incomplete
incoming information based on previously stored representations [11]. It is, thus, theorized to play a role
in generalization [10, 12].
While it is assumed that the imbalance between neural computations related to episodic memory
is associated with positive symptoms, the direction of the imbalance is unclear. On the one hand,
increased memory generalization and deteriorated specificity were assumed to share a common ground
RUNNING HEAD: Schizotypy & pattern separation/false memory
with hallucinations and delusions [7, 8]. In terms of underlying neural mechanisms, this translates into
amplified pattern completion and attenuated pattern separation, as pattern completion is assumed to be
associated with memory generalization and pattern separation is assumed to be related to memory
specificity [10]. The findings of Das and colleagues [13], Martinelli and Shergill [14], as well as
Kraguljac and colleagues [15] supported this framework of impaired memory specificity in
schizophrenia. All studies found the behavioural manifestation of pattern separation to be weaker in
schizophrenia, however, no relationship between the positive symptoms and memory deficits was
revealed. The results are likely to be confounded by relatively small samples, the effect of antipsychotic
medications [16] and may reflect a generalized performance deficit rather than a function-specific
alteration [17].
While these studies highlight that impaired memory specificity may be related to the positive
symptoms of schizophrenia, the long-standing literature of the disorder that dates as far back as to the
1900’s suggests otherwise [18]. Schizophrenia has been described as a disorder of fragmentation with a
distorted sense of subjectivity [19] and by the loss of sense of continuity both to one’s self and perceptual
organization [20]. Relatedly, studies specifically assessing memory alterations have found that positive
symptoms correlated with an increased tendency to remember the local as opposed to the global features
of the stimuli [21, 22]. Such alterations are rather translatable into amplified memory specificity,
implying overactive pattern separation and impaired generalization, which would correspond to
attenuated pattern completion at the neural level.
1.1. Motivation and Aims
It is currently unclear how memory formation may be altered in relation to the positive
symptoms of schizophrenia and, by extension, in people who are prone to irrational or delusion-like
belief formation and unusual perceptual experiences. In particular, two opposing hypotheses emerged
from the literature. On the one hand, the work of Tamminga and colleagues [7, 8], as well as empirical
studies examining clinical samples [13–15] supported the hypothesis that memory specificity is
deteriorated, and generalization is enhanced in schizophrenia. On the other hand, countless accounts in
the long-standing literature on memory alterations in schizophrenia [21–24] and general phenomenology
RUNNING HEAD: Schizotypy & pattern separation/false memory
of the disorder [18, 19] argue that it is rather the process of generalization that is defective, and the
disorder leaves people incapacitated to integrate fragments into a whole implying amplified specificity.
Here, for the first time, we aimed to contrast these two competing hypotheses. To avoid
confounding by illness-related factors such as hospitalization and medication, we recruited a sample
from the general population. To achieve higher statistical power, we increased variability in the sample
by oversampling for positive schizotypy. We assessed memory specificity and generalization - as
behavioural indicators of pattern separation and completion, respectively - with a modified recognition
memory task, the well-established Mnemonic Similarity Task [MST; 25]. We fitted linear regression
models to evaluate the relationship between positive schizotypy and memory specificity vs.
generalization. We established the high reliability of our key measurements. Robustness of the
associations were tested by control analyses adjusting the models for age and gender, perceptual deficits,
negative, disorganized, and impulsive dimensions of schizotypy, and additional aspects of
psychopathology.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants
We have oversampled for high positive schizotypy to ensure sufficient variability, as our aim
was to specifically focus on the positive dimension. As part of the oversampling, 614 people filled out
an online form that included the positive and negative schizotypy subscales from the short Oxford-
Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences Questionnaire (O-LIFE; for details, see below) and a
question about the age of the respondent. The form selected participants based on the following criteria:
age between 18 and 35 years, achieve 7 out of 12 points or higher on the Unusual Experiences subscale
that assesses positive schizotypy, and 3 out of 12 points or lower on the Introvertive Anhedonia subscale
that assesses negative schizotypy (these cut-offs were based on previous large university student samples
[e.g. 26, 27].
191 people met the criteria and 23 of them volunteered to participate in the study. In addition, a
convenience sample of 64 participants were recruited through university courses and social media
advertisements. Some of the participants received course credit as a form of compensation. Further, 11
out of the total of 87 participants were excluded from the final analysis due to a self-reported history of
RUNNING HEAD: Schizotypy & pattern separation/false memory
neurological or psychiatric disorders, epilepsy, or traumatic brain injury. Five participants were
excluded because they were identified by Cook’s Distance as influential points distorting the results of
our regression models (see details in Results). Thus, the final sample comprised 71 participants (17
males, mean [SD] age: 24.0 [5.1] years, mean [SD] education: 16.1 [2.3] years).
Participants provided written informed consent. The authors assert that all procedures
contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional
committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008.
The study was approved by the United Ethical Review Committee for Research in Psychology, Hungary
(2016/032).
2.2. Questionnaires
Participants completed several self-administered psychometric instruments to quantify their
level of schizotypy and general mental well-being from a variety of perspectives. Overall, the
instruments had good reliability in the sample (α >= 0.7, except for negative and impulsive schizotypy;
completed the short version of the O-LIFE questionnaire [28] [Hungarian version: , 29] which measures
schizotypal personality traits. As sleep disturbances have been shown to be correlated with schizotypy
[30], participants completed the Athen Insomnia Scale (AIS) [31] [Hungarian version: , 32]. To obtain
information on psychopathological states, participants also filled questionnaires about momentary
psychotic-like experiences [33] and state anxiety [34] [Hungarian version: , 35]. Higher scores in all
questionnaires correspond to an indicator of pathological functioning, except for the General Health
Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) [36] [Hungarian version: , 37], where a higher score corresponds to better
mental health.
2.3. Mnemonic Similarity Task
simple decisions about pictures of everyday objects. Unbeknownst to participants, this was followed by
a recognition phase, where participants were asked to make memory judgements about pictures of
everyday objects that were either identical, visually similar, or completely different from the pictures
shown in the encoding phase (targets, lures, and foils, respectively). Following previous studies [see
RUNNING HEAD: Schizotypy & pattern separation/false memory
25], the discrimination performance between the studied old items and their visually similar lure pictures
(the ratio of “similar” responses given to the lure items) was used as an indicator of memory specificity
(widely known as the so-called Lure Discrimination Index; LDI), while false recognition of similar lure
pictures (the ratio of “old” responses given to the lures) was used as an index of memory generalization.
Both indices had good split-half reliability in the sample (0.80 and 0.78, respectively). For the detailed
description of the task, see Supplementary Materials and [25].

Note(s). Participants were presented 128 pictures of everyday objects in the encoding phase. In the recognition
phase, participants were shown 192 pictures of everyday objects, 64 of which were exact repetitions of objects
shown in the encoding phase (targets), 64 were new objects (foils) and 64 were perceptually similar items to ones
presented in the encoding phase of the task (lures). ISI = inter-stimulus interval
2.4. Perceptual Discrimination Task
To control for perceptual deficits, participants took part in a Perceptual Discrimination (PD) test
immediately after the completion of the MST. Participants judged whether 90 pairs of images were
identical to, different from, or similar to each other. Stimuli were colourful images of objects. Each trial
consisted of the subsequent presentations of two images and participants were asked to identify them
RUNNING HEAD: Schizotypy & pattern separation/false memory
correctly as “old”, “new”, or “similar” via button press. For the detailed description of the task, see
Supplementary Materials.
3. Results
We have carried out a series of linear regression analyses to examine the relationship between
behavioural indicators of pattern separation (lure discrimination index; LDI) and pattern completion
(false recognition of the lure stimuli) and positive schizotypy scores. The assumptions of
homoscedasticity and normally distributed residuals had been tested and met. Since data points with
large residuals or high leverage may distort the outcome and accuracy of a regression model, we have
excluded five participants based on the Cook’s distance. To assess the specificity of the relationships
between positive schizotypy and the LDI as well as the false recognition of lures, we have carried out
control analyses, where the model was extended with age and gender (entered simultaneously) or one
of the following variables: perceptual discrimination performance; negative, disorganised, or impulsive
schizotypy; insomnia; general mental health; momentary psychotic-like experiences; state anxiety. The
3.1. Lure Discrimination/False Recognition of Lures and Positive Schizotypy
Firstly, we investigated the relationship between the LDI as well as false recognition of lures
and positive schizotypy. If a higher score on the unusual experiences scale of the O-LIFE questionnaire
is to be associated with an attenuated LDI and a higher number of false recognition of lures, then our
results would lend support to the hypothesis of impaired memory specificity and enhanced
generalization. However, if higher positive schizotypy scores are to be associated with an amplified LDI
and lower false recognition of lures, then our results would be in line with the hypothesis of impaired
memory generalization and enhanced specificity. Critically, we found that positive schizotypy was
robustness and specificity of these associations.

3.2. Control Analyses: Age and Gender
We have examined whether the significant relationship between positive schizotypy and the
LDI and false recognition of lures prevails when age and gender are adjusted for. The rationale for
conducting this control analysis was that discrimination performance is known to be affected in the
RUNNING HEAD: Schizotypy & pattern separation/false memory
elderly [e.g. 25, 38]. Based on the results, the relationship with positive schizotypy was still robust (see
showed a significant relationship with the hippocampal computations that are of interest to us.
Attenuated mnemonic discrimination performance and enhanced false recognition of lures were more
likely to be observed in relatively older participants in our sample.
3.3. Control Analyses: Perceptual Discrimination
Further, we considered the possibility that deficits in perception and early visual information
processing may cascade to later stages of information processing. Thus, we have examined whether the
significant effects detected could be explained by elementary perceptual deficits [14]. For this purpose,
we have estimated the LDI and false recognition of lures on the PD test for each individual. Our results
showed a significant relationship between performance on the PD test and the O-LIFE Unusual
lure discrimination performance (β(SE) = 0.014 (0.006), p < 0.01, F(1,69)= 5.997, p < 0.01, Adjusted
= 0.067) and less false recognitions of lures (β(SE) = - 0.007 (0.002), p < 0.001, F(1,69)= 9.785, p <
0.001, Adjusted R
= 0.112) on the PD test. However, discrimination and false recognition of lures on
the MST were not significantly associated with PD test performance, and the effect of positive
schizotypy on performance on the MST remained significant after adjusting for the non-significant
that, although positive schizotypy is associated with altered perceptual discrimination performance, this
does not explain the observed alterations in memory specificity and generalization.

3.4. Control Analyses: Negative, Disorganized and Impulsive-Asocial Dimensions of Schizotypy
We considered three additional dimensions of schizotypy beyond positive schizotypy and
examined whether the relationship between putative behavioural indicators of hippocampal neural
computations and positive schizotypy is specific, or whether it can be extended to the negative,
disorganized, and impulsive-asocial dimensions of schizotypy. None of these O-LIFE dimensions had
a statistically significant relationship with LDI when added as second explanatory variables, and only
negative schizotypy had a statistically significant and positive effect on the false recognition of lures
the associations between positive schizotypy and lure discrimination as well as the false recognition of
lures did not change essentially, providing evidence for their robustness.

To further test for the robustness of the effect of positive schizotypy, we have constructed
regression models where we added insomnia, general mental health, momentary psychotic-like
experiences, and state anxiety, respectively, as additional explanatory variables alongside positive
schizotypy. Our results showed that none of them had a statistically significant effect on the LDI or the

4. Discussion
Positive schizotypy in the general population refers to a tendency of experiencing perceptual
aberrations and odd beliefs, and it seems to form a continuum with the positive symptoms of
schizophrenia such as hallucinations and delusions [1]. It has been established that these symptoms are
associated with specific memory alterations, however, two opposing hypotheses exist that outline the
nature of these alterations. Our aims in the current study were twofold. Firstly, as there is a considerable
phenomenological and cognitive overlap between schizophrenia and schizotypy [1], we tested whether
people with elevated positive schizotypal traits also demonstrate specific alterations in memory.
Importantly, by recruiting individuals from the general population, we minimized confounding by
illness-related factors such as medication or hospitalization, which was a potential limitation of previous
patient studies. Secondly, we aimed to evaluate the two contrasting hypotheses and test whether people
with more pronounced positive schizotypal traits were more prone to overgeneralise when remembering
or memorising rather the local than the global features of events.
Specifically, in line with previous work studying memory generalization and specificity at the
behavioural level, we adapted the MST [25] to measure the behavioural manifestation of specific
hippocampal neural computations. The LDI corresponded to the behavioural proxy of pattern separation
and provided an estimate of the ability to distinguish perceptually similar stimuli, thus, to discriminate
between overlapping memory representations. False recognition of lures corresponded to the
behavioural proxy of pattern completion and served as an estimate of the capability to generalize across
perceptually similar features. Over and above the effects of age and gender, perceptual discrimination,
other dimensions of schizotypy and associated psychopathology, positive schizotypy was consistently
associated with enhanced memory specificity and attenuated generalization. Thus, our results support
the hypothesis that has arisen from the long-established literature describing schizophrenia as a disorder
of fragmentation at several levels [18, 39].
4.1. Impaired Generalization
We found that the more pronounced positive schizotypal traits an individual possesses, the lower
their ability is to mnemonically generalize. This is in line with evidence suggesting that generalization
processes are compromised in schizophrenia [16, 40]. It has been argued that generalization and pattern
RUNNING HEAD: Schizotypy & pattern separation/false memory
completion are related concepts [10]. Relatedly, attenuated pattern completion can be conceptualized as
one possible mechanism underlying lower generalization performance.
According to influential models of autobiographical memory, episodic memories are formed by
a balanced interaction of encoded experience-near record of ongoing activity and the simultaneous need
to maintain a coherent and stable record of the self’s interaction with the world that extends beyond the
present moment [41, 42]. Extracting commonalities regarding one’s self from different experiences
which are robust and permanent presumably requires the ability to generalize. Relatedly, it has been
argued that a cohesive self develops out of an interaction between numerous ‘selves’ that are
experienced through a wide variety of different situations [43]. In line with the theory of weaker
generalization processes, people diagnosed with schizophrenia were also found to have a decreased self-
concept clarity [43]. This implies that patients show impairment in the generalization of common
features regarding the self from various events. Specifically, self-concept clarity was negatively
associated with positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Additionally, attenuated self-concept clarity has
also been found to co-occur with the positive, negative, and disorganized factors of schizotypy [44, 45].
Taken together, impairments in the ability to generalize across several domains in schizophrenia
and schizotypy strongly support our findings that the behavioural proxy of pattern completion is
negatively linked to the positive dimension of schizotypy, implying that higher positive schizotypal
traits are associated with a compromised ability to generalize.
4.2. Amplified Specificity
Higher positive schizotypy was associated with enhanced memory specificity in the present
study. This finding is in line not only with previous findings, but it may also highlight a core, unifying
and more central feature of schizophrenia. Bleuler [18] conceptualized schizophrenia as “a mind that is
torn asunder” by loosening associations [cited by 46]. He suggested that the fragmentation of thought,
emotion and volition should be viewed as the core psychological feature of the disorder [39]. While the
inherently subjective nature of fragmentation renders it challenging to measure, it manifests itself in
pervasive disturbances in mental processes, some of which are observable and quantifiable. Evidence
suggests that individuals with schizophrenia often struggle with multisensory integration [47, 48]. More
importantly, difficulties in information integration within a single cognitive domain such as memory
RUNNING HEAD: Schizotypy & pattern separation/false memory
have also been reported. During visual memory tests, patients exhibited a detail-oriented style of
processing and impaired ability to integrate the details into global features [23, 24]. These results
correspond to the theory that there is a local, as opposed to global, processing bias in schizophrenia [22].
Further, Ferman et al [21] used the global-local paradigm in relation to the different dimensions of the
disorder. Importantly, they found that in patients exhibiting positive symptoms, there was a propensity
towards local processing which, in turn, interfered with global processing. They argued that this
provided evidence for a heightened distractibility to feature detail in association with positive symptoms
of schizophrenia [21].
Our finding of amplified specificity in high positive schizotypy contrasts with previous studies
in patients with schizophrenia which reported impaired memory specificity [13–15]. We suggest that
this discrepancy might be resolved by considering the heterogeneity of schizophrenia: impaired memory
specificity might be a marker of accelerated brain ageing in schizophrenia [49, 50]. This would be in
line with the well-established finding of a positive correlation between impaired memory specificity/lure
discrimination/pattern separation and age [38, 51–53] [12, for overviews, see e.g. , 25]. On the other
hand, the positive symptom dimension might be related to increased memory specificity.
Overall, disruption in the integration of information and, in particular, shift towards detail-
oriented processing is evident from studies. Our results support some of the earliest phenomenological
descriptions of schizophrenia in the literature [18] and are also in line with studies investigating memory
alterations in the disorder in that we have found memory specificity to be enhanced in people with higher
positive schizotypy.
4.3. Strengths and limitations
The strengths of the study include the comparison of two well-articulated competing hypotheses,
the evaluation of alternative explanations through a series of control analyses, and the reliable
measurement of psychopathology and memory alterations. One may argue that our study is limited by
the sample size. However, it should be noted that in order to achieve higher statistical power, we
increased variability in the sample by oversampling for positive schizotypy, and we also established the
high reliability of our key measurements.

5. Conclusion
Deficits in memory, perception, attention, language production, or motor control have all been
detected in schizophrenia and, with lower effect sizes, in people showing high levels of schizotypal traits
[1, 2]. Memory dysfunction is considered to be a particularly pronounced symptom of schizophrenia
[54], as well as being one of the strongest predictors of illness outcome [55, 56], however, opposing
hypotheses emerged in the literature regarding whether patients are more biased toward
overgeneralization, or detail-oriented memories. Over and above contrasting the two frameworks, our
aim was to investigate whether people with higher positive schizotypal traits in the general population
would also show a specific bias in memory. Our results suggest that people who are prone to odd,
delusion-like beliefs, and unusual, hallucination-like experiences are also more likely to struggle to get
hold of the global picture. The fragmentation of memory representations has an important implication
on how we interpret the world around ourselves and how we synthesize information. Thus, people with
higher positive schizotypal traits may be more susceptible to experience unusual perceptions and come
to erroneous conclusions as they may be unable to look beyond the details and take the broad picture
into account. Future high-powered studies with patients should examine the relationship between
variation in symptoms and behavioural indicators of pattern separation and completion.
