ABSTRACT
How did rural areas become conservative electoral strongholds in the US and other advanced
capitalist economies? This paper argues that technological change transformed not only
agriculture but rural political preferences during the twentieth century. It studies a natural
experiment: the post-WWII introduction of improved groundwater pumps and center-pivot
irrigation, which enabled farmers to irrigate otherwise arid land in the Great Plains. These
innovations mainly benefited counties overlying the Ogallala aquifer – a pattern we validate with
computer-vision estimates of technology diffusion using satellite imagery. Difference-in-
difference analyses exploiting this differential impact indicate that technological change played a
large role in the region’s long-term conservative electoral transformation. Additional tests,
including comparison of individual policy preferences inside/outside of the Ogallala aquifer,
support the hypothesis that this was due to increasingly capital-intensive agriculture and the
growing power of agribusiness interests which benefit from conservative economic policies. The
findings demonstrate how new technologies made new politics in rural America.

1. Introduction
Conservative parties thrive electorally in rural areas in the United States and other advanced
capitalist economies (Cramer 2016; Rodden 2019). Especially given the political over-
representation of rural areas, the countryside is a critical source of electoral support for right-
wing political parties. Yet this was not always the case historically (see e.g. Lipset 1950;
Luebbert 1987). In the case of the United States, rural voters were relatively centrist in their
politics and often supported left-wing politicians, like those belonging to the Populist party, in
the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.
What, then, explains the long-term transformation of rural areas into conservative electoral
strongholds? In an important debate stoked by Frank’s (2007) book – which asked “What’s the
Matter with Kansas?” – scholars have puzzled over the growing dominance of the conservative
Republican party in comparatively poor and rural states, a phenomenon that appears to contradict
canonical class-based theories of voting. Yet closer inspection of micro-level survey data
demonstrates that within these states, it is affluent individuals that are most conservative in their
voting patterns (see e.g. Bartels 2006; Gelman 2009).
Building on these debates, this paper explores the role of technological and economic change in
political change in rural areas. Long-term technological change transformed American
agriculture in the twentieth century with innovations ranging from the improvement of crop and
animal varieties, to the refinement of fertilizers and pesticides, to various forms of
mechanization, to the development of new methods for harnessing water for irrigation, especially
groundwater (Anderson 2009; Olmstead and Rhode 2001, 2008; Worster 1992). Due to
technological change, agricultural output quadrupled over the twentieth century in the US despite
an 80 percent decline in labor usage (Pardey and Alston 2021).
Long-term technological change made agriculture more productive but also more capital-
intensive, generating economies of scale which resulted in the winnowing of unproductive and
precarious family farms, and their replacement by highly productive, business-like farms as well
as the spatial agglomeration of agricultural industries – known jointly as agribusiness – which
benefit from conservative economic policies, including limited government regulation and pro-
business tax and spending policies. The growing economic and political power of agribusiness
interests in rural areas has, this paper argues, played an important role in the long-term
conservative transformation of rural political preferences and the increasing electoral success of
the Republican party in rural areas.
To test the argument, this paper exploits a historical natural experiment in the American Great
Plains: the post-war introduction of new irrigation technologies, which enabled farmers to
profitably irrigate otherwise arid land – but only in areas with access to groundwater (Edwards
and Smith 2018; Hornbeck and Keskin 2014; Splinter 1976). Without irrigation, the arid climate
of the Great Plains is suitable mainly for extensive agriculture (attempts at intensive farming
without controlled irrigation were partially responsible for the Dust Bowl which followed the
droughts of the 1930s). Though the Ogallala aquifer, one of the largest in the world, spans a large
part of the Great Plains, until the 1940s available technology made it uneconomical to pump and
distribute this groundwater on a large scale.
Following World War II, two innovations unleashed a process of technological change that
transformed the Great Plains. The first was the adaptation of petroleum engines to groundwater
extraction at scale through deep well pumps. The second was the invention of center-pivot
irrigation, a system for irrigating large circular fields from a central well with a rotating arm
affixed with sprinklers. Together, these innovations – “perhaps the most significant mechanical
innovation in agriculture since the replacement of draft animals by the tractor” (Splinter 1976, p.
90) – enabled the spread of irrigation and the emergence of highly productive, capital-intensive
farms operated by increasingly wealthy farmers as well as the spatial agglomeration of
downstream industries like animal feedlots and meatpacking plants. As a result, the Great Plains
turned into one of the most industrialized and productive agricultural regions in the world.
However, these technologies primarily benefited areas with access to groundwater, the main
source of which is the Ogallala aquifer. To validate this key source of variation in exposure to
technological change, we develop computer vision estimates of the diffusion of center-pivot
irrigation based on a convolutional neural network trained to detect the technology’s signature
circular cropping patterns in historical satellite imagery. This exercise motivates the difference-
in-differences identification strategy, which exploits time variation arising from the post-war
introduction of the new technologies together with cross-sectional variation in aquifer coverage
in a spatially matched sample of counties along the boundary of the Ogallala aquifer to
investigate whether counties more impacted by the technological shock also became more
conservative in their voting patterns over time.
Empirically, we use GIS to measure the share of county land overlying the Ogallala aquifer. We
link this information to county-level panel data on the Republican party’s share of the two-party
vote in presidential, senatorial, and gubernatorial elections between 1920 and 2000. Difference-
in-differences analyses – which in preferred specifications prune the sample of counties to
200km and 100km buffer zones along the boundary of the Ogallala aquifer in each state and also
control for state-time-period fixed effects – indicate that technological change played a large role
in the region’s long-term conservative electoral transformation. Decade-by-decade analyses
suggest that a positive association between aquifer coverage and conservative voting emerged
precisely when the new irrigation technologies were introduced and was not driven by
potentially confounding pre-trends.
Additional tests indicate that the conservative electoral shift was driven by the spread of capital-
intensive agriculture and the growing economic and political power of agribusiness interests.
After WWII, counties with greater aquifer coverage experienced a large relative increase in the
capital-intensity of agriculture as measured by the density and market value of farms. By
contrast, tests do not support alternative commonly posited explanations for rural conservatism,
such as intrinsic differences between rural and urban voters, religiosity or race-related political
polarization. The conservative shift began in the 1940s, well before the race-related realignment
of the 1960s in the US south. Counties with greater aquifer coverage experienced little
depopulation and a relative increase in urbanization, due to the emergence of small towns in
areas of intensive agriculture. Counties with greater aquifer coverage experienced little relative
change over time in religiosity as proxied by church membership.
Analysis of Cooperative Congressional Election Survey (CCES) data suggests that contemporary
mass policy preferences differ systematically between individuals residing in zip codes just
inside the Ogallala aquifer compared to those residing just outside, reflecting the long-term
political legacy of the post-war technological shock. Individuals living inside the boundaries of
the Ogallala aquifer, where capital-intensive agriculture and agribusiness-dependent local
political economies thrive, are today systematically more opposed to environmental and labor
regulation and to taxation and the welfare state. Attitudes also differ with regards to some
moral/cultural issues. These attitudinal spillovers may reflect feedback effects of the strategic
bundling of economic and social issues by political parties.
The findings contribute to two main areas of research. First, they contribute to research on the
origins of the urban-rural political divide, one of the defining features of politics in advanced
capitalist economies (Cramer 2016; Rodden 2019). Important work shows that urban-centered
technological dynamics like industrialization and the rise of the knowledge economy were
pivotal in the historical emergence of left-wing politics in cities (Rodden 2019). We show that
technological change in agriculture – a process that transformed politics in many other settings
(Boix 2015; Dasgupta 2018; Moore 1966) – played an equally important role in the emergence
of right-wing politics in the countryside, as precarious homesteads operated by yeoman farmers
(the base of left-wing agrarian movements of the past like the Populist party) gave way to a
sector dominated by capital-intensive farms and agricultural industries opposed to regulation and
taxation. Our findings in combination with past work demonstrate how spatial political
polarization has emerged as a result of technology-driven structural transformation in the
twentieth century. Though this paper does not identify the cumulative political effects of all the
agricultural innovations that have taken place in this time period, it leverages one particularly
large post-war technological shock to provide causally identified evidence on how new
technologies have made new politics in rural America
The findings also provide a new answer to longstanding debates in American politics about
“what’s the matter with Kansas” – i.e. why the party of the rich, the Republican party, thrives in
comparatively poor and rural states (Bartels 2006; Frank 2007; Gelman 2009; Hacker and
Pierson 2020; Walsh 2012). Frank’s explanation emphasizes the role of the “culture wars” in
distracting poor and rural voters from class-based conflict, echoing theoretical models in political
science which suggest that cross-cutting cleavages can weaken political support for redistribution
in democracies (see e.g. Iversen 2006; Lee and Roemer 2006). While not incompatible with
these explanations, this paper shows that much of the rise of rural conservatism can be traced to
economic self-interest conceptualized in terms of the industries geographically concentrated in
rural areas. Long-term technological change led to the emergence of agribusiness-dependent
rural political economies, many residents of which, especially land and business owners but also
the non-affluent, instrumentally support the Republican party. Indeed, new research finds that
local economic dependence on other regulation averse industries common in rural areas, like
fracking, is associated with conservatism (Cooper, Kim, and Urpelainen 2018; Sances and You
Forthcoming). In the paper, we detail how agribusiness exerts outsized political influence in rural
areas where it is a dominant industry, due to the “structural” dependence of rural communities on
the agribusiness economy (Przeworski and Wallerstein 1988), as well as the organized activism
of agribusiness interests. In this sense, the findings also contribute to the literature on business
power (Hacker et al. 2021).
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. It first describes the historical setting. It then
discusses the theoretical mechanisms linking technological change to the rise of rural
conservatism. It then presents the empirical strategy and results before concluding.
2. Technological and Political Change in the Great Plains
Agriculture in the Great Plains – a broad expanse of grassland spanning the American states of
Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota,
Montana, and North Dakota – dates to the Homestead Act of 1862, which encouraged migration
and agricultural development west of the Mississippi river with the promise of property rights to
160 acres of land to settlers who could offer proof of having settled and cultivated the land for
five years. By the 1890s, the Great Plains were extensively populated by settlers, turning what
had been a frontier region into a center of agriculture.
The conversion of arid prairie land into family farms – motivated by the widely held (but
incorrect) belief that “rain follows the plow” – had devastating long-run ecological consequences
(Libecap and Hansen 2002). The elimination of prairie grasses that held the soil in place
contributed to soil erosion, culminating in the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, a combination of
prolonged drought, dust storms, and soil erosion that devastated agricultural production (Cook,
Miller, and Seager 2009; Hornbeck 2012).
In the midst of collapsing demand and falling prices of the Great Depression, the Dust Bowl
contributed to mass outmigration, in spite of New Deal programs that sought to mitigate falling
prices and provide a safety net to farmers by paying them to cull livestock and reduce crop
acreage. Agriculture in the region began to recover in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The newly
created Soil Conservation Service (SCS) disseminated dryland agricultural practices, including
the conversion of cropland to pastureland and the dissemination of drought-resistant crops. Many
of the small family farms abandoned by debt-ridden small farmers were reclaimed by banks,
resulting in the consolidation of agricultural land into larger farms, alleviating some of the
coordination problems associated with adopting environmentally sustainable practices (Hansen
and Libecap 2004).
Yet, agriculture remained relatively unproductive and susceptible to droughts until the
introduction of two post-WWII inter-related improvements in irrigation technology. The first
was the adaptation of petroleum-powered engines to the task of extracting groundwater, resulting
in much cheaper costs of lifting large volumes of groundwater. The pre-existing technology for
extracting groundwater was the windmill pump, which was constrained in the depth and quantity
of water it could draw, generally limiting its use to water supply for the household and livestock.
While more powerful pumps existed, their operating costs were prohibitively expensive for
usage in agricultural irrigation (Opie 2000, p. 126). Petroleum-powered irrigation pumps, based
initially on the adaptation of automobile engines to deep well pumps, became widely available
after World War II, making it much cheaper and economical to extract groundwater on a scale
sufficient to irrigate crops, resulting in the spread of pump-based deep well groundwater
irrigation from the 1940s and 1950s onward.
The second, closely related innovation, necessitated by the first, was the invention of center-
pivot irrigation, a system for irrigation based on the sprinkler-based distribution of water from a
central well through rotating arms up to a half-mile in radius. Invented by Frank Zybach in the
1940s and patented in 1952, center-pivot irrigation spread rapidly from the 1950s onward,
resulting in the signature circular cropping patterns that dominate large parts of the Great Plains.
The combination of cheaper extraction of groundwater as well as an efficient method for
distributing water over a large area from a central source represented one of the most important
technological innovations in agricultural history, enabling farmers to irrigate from the Ogallala
aquifer, one of the largest in the world. This enabled farmers to cultivate lucrative but water-
intensive feed crops like corn and also contributed to the spatial agglomeration of downstream
agricultural industries like animal feedlots and meatpacking plants – transforming the Great
Plains into one of the most industrialized and productive agricultural regions of the world despite
the arid climate (Cunfer 2005; Opie 2000).
The technological revolution in the Great Plains coincided with a political revolution: the
growing dominance of the Republican party in elections in a region that had historically been
relatively centrist in its politics (in the sense of mirroring national trends) and where left-wing
politics sometimes thrived. During the period of national Republican party dominance in the
nineteenth century, farmers in the Great Plains also tended to support the Republican party,
especially because of its support for the westward expansion of the railroad network (Aldrich
1995). In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, left-wing politics found considerable
success in the Great Plains, first in the form of the Populist party – which promised to nationalize
the railways, eliminate the gold standard, and enact other redistributive policies intended to help
poor and indebted farmers. Congressional representatives, majorities in state legislatures, and/or
governors belonging to the Populist party were elected from five (Colorado, Kansas, South
Dakota, Nebraska, and Montana) Great Plains states (see e.g. Ostler 1993). Subsequently,
reflecting national trends, both major political parties registered electoral victories in Great
Plains states over time, including the Democratic party under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose
New Deal policies were popular among poor farmers.
Following World War II, however, the Great Plains states became increasingly pro-Republican
in their voting patterns, a trend that has proceeded unabated up to the present. Today, the region
is an outlier in the degree of its staunch support for the Republican party. Eight out of 10 Great
Plains states are “red” states – defined as states in which Republican presidential candidates have
won at least three of the five presidential elections over the 2000-16 period (Grumbach, Hacker,
and Pierson 2021) – a transformation that has led to debates among scholars and journalists
about the historical origins of this conservative electoral shift. One conjecture emphasizes the
“culture wars” which have purportedly distracted poor and rural voters from issues of
redistribution and won them over to the side of the Republican party due to their social
conservatism (Frank 2007). Others have pointed out, however, that in survey data household
income remains a robust predictor of Republican party voting (Bartels 2006), though red states
like Kansas are also characterized by an “intercept shift” or greater individual propensity to vote
for the Republican party at all income levels (Gelman 2009). Together, these stylized facts
challenge the “culture wars” hypothesis but also raise the question of where the aggregate long-
term shift in conservative voting originates.
Great Plains counties shaded according to the Republican party’s percentage of the two-party
vote in presidential elections between 1920 and 1940 in panel A and between 1980 and 2000 in
panel B. As the map illustrates, over this period, the Great Plains evolved from a mostly “purple”
(centrist) region into a consistently “red” (pro-Republican) region in elections.
3. How New Technologies Made New Politics
We develop a new explanation for the conservative transformation of rural political preferences
that emphasizes not the culture wars but the role of long-term technological change in
contributing to the emergence of capital-intensive agriculture and agribusiness, the growing
economic and political power of which has played an important role in the increasing
conservative electoral tilt of the region.
Until the post-war technological shock, homesteaders and farmers on the Great Plains were
typically poor and precarious, and struggled to make a living on marginal and arid lands suitable
mainly for dryland farming. Unsurprisingly, many of these small producers were the worst
victims of the Dust Bowl and Great Depression of the 1930s and important beneficiaries from
the system of agricultural safety nets implemented in exchange for production controls enacted
by the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) of 1933, which granted the federal government the
authority to “secure voluntary reduction of the acreage of basic crops….and to direct payments
for participation in acreage control programs” as well as to license, regulate, and tax agricultural
activities. In process of policy making politics, this legislation mobilized farmers into politics,
giving rise to the “farm lobby”, the influence of which historically spanned both major American
political parties (Finegold and Skocpol 1995; Hansen 1991; Sheingate 2003) , with both the
Democratic and Republican parties competing for the votes of farmers with bipartisan federal
farm bills laden with subsidies.
However, as new irrigation technologies made agriculture more productive in areas with access
to groundwater, they also brought sweeping changes to rural economic structure and political
preferences. In a process found in other rural areas of the US (McWilliams 1939; Pardey and
Alston 2021; Worster 1992), the increasing capital intensity of agriculture led to a winning of
small producers, who lacked the economies of scale needed to survive in an environment with
increasing costs of land, machinery, and inputs. In their place emerged increasingly capital-
intensive, mechanized, and productive farms, operated by upwardly mobile farmers in a new
form of business-like agriculture which came to be known as “agribusiness”.4 As one
contemporaneous study of the impact of new irrigation technologies in a rural Kansas county put
it: “Farming had become agribusiness…The average size farm of 1200 acres represented a
considerable capital outlay, and rising operating costs were all but eliminating the marginal
farmer in 1965. (Mays 1968, p. 36)” Over time, downstream industries reliant on water-intensive
agriculture like feedlots and meat-packing plants – characterized by high levels of industrial

concentration due to extensive vertical integration and interlocking relationships – also
agglomerated on the Great Plains. These transformations are documented by Opie (2000, p. 268):
“As irrigation brought prosperity to the High Plains, smaller farmers were pushed out of the
way…the shift from the family farm toward large-scale centralized agribusiness operations can
be compared to the demise of ‘ma-and-pa’ neighborhood grocery stores after World War Two as
supermarkets became commonplace.”
Unlike the small producers which comprised a core constituency of the New Deal interventionist
farm policies of the 1930s, dependency on intensive utilization of land, groundwater, and hired
labor pitted affluent farmers and agribusiness interests against regulation by government
agencies. For instance, from the 1960s onward, as groundwater levels fell, landowners in the
Great Plains lobbied to restrain government attempts to meter and regulate groundwater through
groundwater management districts (Bessire 2021; Bloomquist, Williams, and Bridger 2002; Opie
2000). More recently, toxic waste-producing agribusiness sites like animal feedlots, which can
produce as much waste and pollution as small-sized towns, have come into conflict with
government regulations under the Clean Air Act (enacted in 1963) and Clean Water Act (enacted
in 1972). Meatpacking plants, which from the 1960s onwards relocated from cities to small rural
towns both to move closer to the feedlot industry as well to cut labor costs, are large-scale
employers of labor and are well-known to oppose stringent labor regulation, such as higher
minimum wages, employer insurance obligations, workplace safety laws, and union-friendly
policies (Pachirat 2011).
As farmers became wealthier, they also became more opposed to taxation and redistribution,
consistent with canonical theories of class-based fiscal conflict (Meltzer and Richard 1981). By
the 1970s, according to agricultural censuses the average market value of farms across counties
in the Great Plains was over $1.5 million, up from around $200,000 in the 1930s in 2016 dollars
(as we will show, the increase in farm values was concentrated in irrigated counties overlying the
Ogallala aquifer). As farms have become lucrative assets, protection of assorted tax breaks,
exclusion from estate taxes, write-offs and deductions has become a major area of lobbying on
the part of industry associations like the Farm Bureau. Large-scale farms and agribusinesses have
also sought over time to reshape the farm subsidy system, seeking to delink subsidies from
production controls – the lynchpin of the New Deal-era farm policies – in favor of a “market-
oriented” regime linking subsidies to the quantity of a farm’s output, concentrating subsidies in
the largest farms (Dimitri, Effland, and Conklin 2005; Sheingate 2003).
In rural areas where agribusiness has become a dominant industry, the power of agribusiness is
“structural”, not unlike the power of the coal industry in former “company towns” or the oil and
gas industry in shale regions (Cooper, Kim, and Urpelainen 2018; Gaventa 1982; Przeworski and
Wallerstein 1988; Sances and You Forthcoming). Not just land and business owners but entire
rural communities depend upon the agribusiness economy. As a result, the post-war economic
boom that benefited counties overlying the Ogallala aquifer produced a sense of shared sectoral
interest that leads the non-affluent, like middle-class residents and workers, to internalize the
policy preferences of agribusiness. As Anderson (2018) puts it: “Water for irrigation and large-
scale animal feeding didn’t only grow crops and livestock, it gave life to the Great Plains
communities that depended on agriculture. Families and laborers shopped at local retailers and
deposited wages in local banks, keeping small towns alive, and irrigators paid the property taxes
that sustained local governments. Center pivot irrigation supported … a whole way of life that
would have literally dried up if the fields were less productive.”
Despite significant rural inequality, class-based conflict has been superseded by a sectoral rural
political identity, partly because the rural poor are far less organized than are land and business
owners. For instance, low-wage workers in Great Plains meatpacking factories are completely
un-unionized (Stull, Broadway, and Griffith 1995), due to right-to-work laws and other
challenges to labor organizing, including a largely migrant workforce. By contrast, agribusiness
interests are highly organized through industry associations like the Farm Bureau, which
influences rural public opinion by circulating mailers, organizing events, and endorsing
candidates in elections. Once an extension service, today the local branches of the Farm Bureau
are deeply conservative advocacy organizations. Moreover, government agencies, ranging from
groundwater management districts to the USDA, institutionalize the representation of land and
business owners in a variety of policymaking arenas but not other rural stakeholders, like
workers, further tipping the scales against their organization.
The role of technological change in the conservative transformation of rural political preferences
is documented in repeated rural community studies of Haskell County – overlying the Ogallala
aquifer in southwestern Kansas – conducted by sociologists over a 50-year period spanning the
pre- and post-technological shock eras. In the initial study, Bell (1942) found a community that
had been recently devastated by the Dust Bowl and Depression of the 1930s, and which suffered
from a boom-and-bust pattern of wheat harvests due to volatile precipitation. This generated, he
observed, a “gambler’s psychology” which affected the entire community: “Agriculture
dominates [the entire populace’s] existence and influences their attitudes in much the way that
mining does a village in which the whole population derives its living from the mine. (p. 55)”
Consistent with theories linking precarity to preferences for social insurance (Rawls 1999), a
consequence was widespread belief in the legitimate role of government intervention: “Everyone
interviewed, whether in favor of or opposed to the Government farm program was unanimous in
the opinion that, as one man said: ‘If it had not been for the Government program, none of us
would be here now. We simply could not have made it.’ (p. 66)”
When Mays (1968) revisited the county 25 years later, political attitudes had been transformed
by the introduction of groundwater irrigation. With growing prosperity came a shift from a
“gambler’s psychology” to a business-like belief in success linked to individual effort and
increasing opposition to government intervention: “The [Haskell County farm operator] believes
that he has won through to his present-day successes by virtue of his own efforts…if the
government will remove its many controls, he can grow abundantly all that the country needs
and receive good prices for his produce” (p. 112). These changes in attitudes extended beyond
the affluent farmer: “The population now accepts as their ideal-type the farmer-capitalist, or agri-
businessman, who has won out against great odds.” When sociologists revisited the county
another 30 years later in 1993, they noted the emergence of factory-style industries like animal
feedlots and meatpacking plants. They also documented the mass government skepticism that is
characteristic of contemporary rural consciousness (Cramer 2016): “When asked about the
problems facing their community, the two most frequently mentioned issues were increasing
taxation and the loss of local control to the state and federal governments. (Williams and
2006, respectively, illustrating the technological changes which have transformed not only the
landscape but the politics of the county.
As the conservative party on the economic dimension of political party competition in the United
States (Poole and Rosenthal 2000), the Republican party’s pro-business orientation made it the
electoral beneficiary of the spread of capital-intensive agriculture and the conservative
transformation of rural political preferences. By contrast, the Democratic party’s association with
pro-labor and environmental regulation as well as redistributive taxation have made it a
comparative threat to agribusiness interests. These differences in party platforms have existed for
at least a century but have hardened and polarized over time, especially since the Republican
party’s embrace of a hardline anti-regulation stance during the 1980s, as well as the spatial
polarization of the Republican and Democratic parties into rural- and urban-centered political
coalitions, respectively (Hacker and Pierson 2010; Rodden 2019).
areas more exposed to the post-war irrigation technology shock became more conservative (pro-
Republican) in their voting patterns over time. In terms of mechanisms, we hypothesize that this
was due to the increasing capital-intensity of agriculture and the growing economic and political
power of agribusiness interests with preferences for conservative economic policies, including
limited regulation as well pro-business tax and spending policies. These interests exert broader
influence on mass policy preferences through their “structural” and organizational power in
agribusiness-dependent rural political economies. We therefore also expect to observe
differences in mass attitudes concerning government taxation and regulation across areas more or
less exposed to the post-war technological shock.
4. Empirical Strategy
To test the impact of the technological change on the rise of conservative voting in the Great
Plains, this paper exploits the differential impact of the post-war irrigation technology shock
across counties with different degrees of overlap with the Ogallala aquifer, an approximately
174,000-square-mile body of groundwater that underlies parts of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska,
New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming. The differential impact of the
post-war technology shock is evidenced in a number of ways, for instance in large differences in
the capitalized market value of farmland with and without access to the Ogallala aquifer
(Hornbeck and Keskin 2014).
To validate this source of variation in exposure to technological change that underpins our
empirical strategy, we develop estimates of the diffusion of center-pivot irrigation, using tools
from the field of computer vision to detect the technology’s signature circular cropping patterns
in historical satellite imagery. A detailed discussion is provided in the Online Appendix. In brief,
we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to count the number of center-pivot irrigation
circles observable in Landsat satellite imagery across counties over time in the Great Plains.
CNNs are supervised learning algorithms which take images as input and as output make
predictions about image characteristics (for a primer see e.g. Torres and Cantú 2022), in our case
an estimate of the number of visible center-pivots.
We train a 15-layer CNN to take as input the pixel Landsat 5 satellite image of a Public
70 × 70
Land Survey System (PLSS) section – the 1 square mile unit of the grid that governs property
rights in the western United States – and as output estimate the number of center-pivot irrigation
systems visible in the image. To train the model, we use as “ground truth” labels a geo-coded
inventory of center-pivot irrigation systems that was compiled though hand counting of crop
circles in Landsat satellite imagery by a team of researchers for the state of Nebraska (Carlson
1989). We use this data to label the count of center-pivot irrigation systems in clipped satellite
images – from which we compute the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) – for all
PLSS sections in Nebraska between 1985 and 1987 (N With a CNN trained on this
≈ 220,000).
data, we count center-pivot irrigation systems visible in Landsat 5 satellite imagery in a massive
number of PLSS sections across all of the Great Plains states for every year between 1985 and
2000 (N 10 million), aggregating and normalizing by land area to get county-level estimates of
technology adoption (center-pivots per 1000 sq kilometers) with near-human accuracy ( of

heavily concentrated within the Ogallala aquifer boundary (a pattern we subject to formal
statistical tests later in the paper).
These patterns motivate the identification strategy, which exploits the timing of the post-war
irrigation technology shock together with cross-sectional variation in groundwater availability in
a spatially matched sample of counties along the boundary of the Ogallala aquifer in a
difference-in-differences framework. In the main specifications, the paper estimates OLS

period in a county with complete aquifer coverage relative to a county with no aquifer coverage,
comparing between counties located within the same state.
For robustness, we estimate the difference-in-differences regression equation above in a spatially
matched sample of counties along the boundary of the Ogallala aquifer. To implement the spatial
matching in a manner that preserves the within-state difference-in-differences design we: i)
identify the line segment of the Ogallala aquifer boundary intersecting each state; ii) compute the
geodesic distance of each county centroid in each state to the nearest point on the within-state
line segment; and iii) prune from the sample any counties beyond a given buffer (200 kilometers
or 100 kilometers) based on this distance metric. This ensures that all estimates are derived
strictly from over-time comparisons between spatially proximate counties along the border of the
Ogallala aquifer within the same state.
The spatial matching is motivated by Tobler’s Law First Law of Geography (“near things are
more related than distant things”). By limiting analysis to spatially proximate counties, we
mitigate concerns about potentially confounding non-parallel trends that may result from
comparing fundamentally dissimilar counties that are located far away from each other.
However, a concern that arises is spatial spillovers – exposure to the technological shock
potentially impacted the economies and electoral outcomes of nearby counties. To address this
concern, in some specifications we prune counties on the boundary itself, so that the sample is
restricted to “pure” treatment (completely within the aquifer) and control (completely outside of

depicts the relationship between aquifer coverage and conservative voting across counties within
200km of the Ogallala aquifer boundary in the pre-technological shock period, after partialing
out state fixed effects. For illustrative purposes, Kansas counties are represented with shaded
points. We highlight the point that corresponds to Haskell County with a red diamond. As the
scatter plot and fitted OLS regression line make clear, there was little association between
aquifer coverage and the Republican party’s share of the two-party presidential vote in the pre-
shock period 1920-1940. A county like Haskell, which lies completely within the boundaries of
the Ogallala aquifer, was no more conservative in its voting patterns than other counties in the
same state with less overlap with the Ogallala aquifer.
Panel B depicts the same relationship in the post-shock period 1980-2000. As the scatterplot and
fitted OLS regression line illustrate, counties with greater aquifer coverage experienced a greater
improvement in the Republican party’s electoral performance compared to counties with less
aquifer coverage. Haskell County, for instance, evolved into one of the most conservative
counties in Kansas. The scatter plot suggests that this pattern is not idiosyncratic to Haskell but is
systematic. Counties with greater aquifer coverage on average experienced a greater long-term
improvement in the Republican party’s electoral performance compared to counties in the same
state with less aquifer coverage, plausibly because they were more exposed to the post-war
irrigation technology shock that transformed the Great Plains.
The identifying assumption in the difference-in-differences analyses is the parallel trends
assumption, which in this case assumes that, counter-factually absent the post-war irrigation
technology shock, counties with greater overlap with the Ogallala aquifer would have followed
parallel electoral trends over time as compared to other spatially proximate counties within the
same state with less overlap. In an additional set of specifications, to study pre- and post-
technological shock time trends, this paper estimates regressions on a full county-year panel
election dataset which flexibly interact the aquifer coverage variable with decadal dummy
variables, while also controlling for state-year effects. If the parallel trends assumption is valid,
then there should have been no trend in the association between aquifer coverage and
conservative voting in the decades preceding the technological shock but a large and positive
relationship that emerged in the decades following the technological shock.
To account for correlation of errors within counties over time, as well as correlation of errors
across space in a given election, we estimate standard errors adjusted for two-way clustering
within counties and within state-periods. We also estimate Conley standard errors which correct
for spatial correlation within a given radius of county centroids (we use a 200km radius) as well
as serial correlation. Throughout, we limit the sample to counties (93 percent of the sample) with
stable boundaries between the start year of 1920 and the end year of 2000 (the preceding decades
of the 1900s and 1910s were characterized by a large number of boundary changes, including the
admission of New Mexico and Oklahoma as new states). We drop counties in Montana and
North Dakota as they do not intersect with the Ogallala aquifer and therefore do not contribute to
estimation because they are fully absorbed by state-period fixed effects.
4. Main Results
counties, panel B for the 200km buffer sample of counties and panel C for the 100km buffer
sample of counties. Columns (1)-(3) report coefficient estimates for the baseline specification,
which indicate that the post-war irrigation technology shock had a large impact on conservative
(pro-Republican) voting. For instance, the coefficients on the interaction term in panel B (the
200km buffer sample) suggest that compared to a spatially proximate county with no aquifer
coverage in the same state, a county with full aquifer coverage experienced a 9.7 percentage
point relative increase in the Republican party’s share of the two-party vote in presidential
elections, a 7.8 percentage point relative increase in senatorial elections, and a 6.4 percentage
point relative increase in gubernatorial elections from the pre- to the post-technological shock
period. By contrast, the coefficients on the lower order term indicate that there was no
association between aquifer coverage and conservative voting across counties in the pre-
technological shock period.
Columns (4)-(6) additionally control for county-level exposure to two pre-treatment shocks
which affected the Great Plains: the Dust Bowl, the drought and dust storms which wracked
much of the region, as well as the New Deal, which greatly impacted rural areas. To measure
county-level exposure to the Dust Bowl, we digitize historical soil erosion maps published by the
Soil Conservation Service and compute a measure of the share of county land impacted by
“severe wind erosion” by 1937 (see Online Appendix for details). To compute exposure to the
New Deal, we use a summary measure of spending across major programs per capita based on
the dataset assembled by Fishback, Horrace, and Kantor (2005). We include these variables as
lower order terms as well as in interaction with post-technological shock time-based dummy
variable in order to absorb potential non-parallel trends across counties as a function of these
pre-treatment shock variables. While the coefficients of interest shrink slightly, they remain large
and positive across specifications.
Columns (7)-(9) address concerns about spatial spillovers by pruning counties partially
intersecting the boundary of the Ogallala aquifer, so that the sample is comprised only of “pure”
treatment counties fully contained within the aquifer and control counties fully outside of the
aquifer. Consistent with the existence of spatial spillovers, the coefficients tend to become larger
in this specification. Estimates from the 200km buffer sample suggest that compared to a
spatially proximate county with no aquifer coverage in the same state, a county with full aquifer
coverage experienced a 10.8 percentage point relative increase in the Republican party’s share of
the two-party vote in presidential elections, a 8.1 percentage point relative increase in senatorial
elections, and a 6.7 percentage point relative increase in gubernatorial elections from the pre- to
the post-technological shock period.
This helps to make sense of a noticeable pattern: across empirical specifications, though the
coefficients remain substantively large and statistically significant, the estimated magnitude of
the impact of the technological shock tends to be smaller in specifications that prune the sample
to a smaller buffer along the boundary of the Ogallala aquifer. While some of this may be due to
the elimination of potentially confounding differences between spatially distant counties, it may
also be due to the existence of spatial spillovers, which tend to attenuate estimates, especially in
spatially proximate samples.
Another empirical pattern than emerges from the estimates is that across samples and
specifications, the coefficient estimates are consistently greater in magnitude in the case of
presidential voting than in senatorial elections, and greater in senatorial elections than in
gubernatorial elections. One reason for this may be due to the dynamics of party positioning. In
national elections, the platforms of the Democratic and Republican parties are sharply polarized,
whereas in more state-specific elections, the Democratic party may have greater scope to
moderate its platforms to win over rural voters. For instance, in a state like Kansas, a Democratic
presidential candidate has not won the state’s electoral college votes since 1964. However,
Democratic candidates routinely win gubernatorial elections in the state and the party remains
competitive with the Republican party.
Were these effects plausibly due to the disproportionate impact of the post-war irrigation
the same type of regressions but now looks at measures of irrigation technology adoption as the
outcome variable. Columns (1)-(3) look at impacts on the percentage of county farmland that is
irrigated according to agricultural censuses. The coefficient estimate in column (2) based on a
200km buffer sample suggests that a county with full aquifer coverage experienced an
approximately 13.8 percentage point improvement in irrigation from the 1920-1940 period to the
1980-2000 period, relative to a spatially proximate county with no aquifer coverage in the same
state. Columns (4)-(6) look at a particularly capital-intensive form of irrigation – center-pivot
irrigation – as estimated from satellite imagery. The estimate from column (5) suggests that a
county with full aquifer coverage gained approximately 105 additional center-pivot irrigation
systems per 1000 sq km from the 1920-1940 period to the 1980-2000 period, relative to a county
with no aquifer coverage in the same state.
with greater aquifer coverage experienced a relative improvement in irrigation as well increase in
electoral conservatism following the post-war irrigation technology shock. For instance,
combining estimates from the specifications based on a spatially matched sample of counties
within a 200km distance to the Ogallala aquifer boundary, the estimates suggest that for every 1
percentage point relative improvement in irrigated farmland due to greater aquifer coverage, the
Republican party experienced an approximately 0.7 percentage point relative improvement in its
share of the two-party vote in presidential elections.
flexible specifications using a full county-year panel dataset of election returns and reporting
coefficients on decadal dummy variables interacted with the aquifer coverage variable,
controlling for state-year fixed effects. Columns (1)-(3) examine the Republican party’s share of
the two-party vote in presidential elections, while columns (4)-(6) examine senatorial elections,
and columns (7)-(9) gubernatorial elections. The coefficients indicate that across empirical
samples and type of election, there was no statistically detectable association between aquifer
coverage and conservative voting in the 1910s, 1920s and 1930s and that this null relationship
was stable until a positive relationship began to emerge in the 1940s and 1950s, exactly when the
new irrigation technologies were introduced. These effects grew over time, consistent with the
gradual uptake of irrigation technologies. Columns (10)-(12) report a parallel set of results for
the spread of irrigation. These show that, prior to the availability of technology needed to exploit
groundwater at scale, there was no association between county-level aquifer coverage and the
irrigation but a large and positive relationship that emerged from the post-shock period onwards.
tests for pre- and post-shock trends by omitting the interaction term between aquifer coverage
and the dummy variable indicating the 1930s (the decade preceding the introduction of the new
irrigation technology) and including state-year fixed effects and county fixed effects (to deal
with sample selection issues as some counties drop out in the 1910s). This permits an analysis of
whether the relationship between aquifer coverage and outcomes displayed a statistically
detectable difference relative to that existing in the 1930s. As panels A through C indicate, there
was no visibly confounding pre-trend in the estimated relationship between aquifer coverage and
conservative voting prior to the technological shock, but a large positive trend that emerged
thereafter, due to the disproportionate spread of irrigation to counties with greater aquifer overlap
from the 1940s onward as documented in panel D.
5. Tests of Channels
Were these effects due to the spread of increasingly capital-intensive agriculture and agribusiness
interests with conservative policy preferences, as has been argued? Or were they potentially due
to other factors? This section of the paper explores potential channels by empirically examining
the impact of the technological shock on a range of intermediate outcomes measured from
agricultural, population, and religious censuses (descriptive statistics are available in the Online
Appendix).
outcomes. Columns (1) and (2) investigate the impact of the post-war irrigation technology
shock on the capital intensity of agriculture, as proxied by the natural log of the average market
value of farms in 2016 dollars (computed from agricultural censuses by dividing the total market
value of farm land, buildings, and machinery by the number of farms in a county) and the
number of farms per 1000 acres of county land. As the coefficients indicate, farms in counties
with greater aquifer coverage were no more valuable than in counties with less and actually
slightly less dense in the decades preceding the post-war shock. Areas with greater aquifer
coverage experienced a large relative increase in both the market value and density of farms
statistical test and gives a sense of their magnitude by scaling the vertical axis by plus or minus a
standard deviation of the outcome variable.
Column (3) looks at the share of the employed population working in agricultural occupations
(an under-estimate as it includes only those working directly on farms but excludes those
working in related industries) as reported by population censuses. The estimates show that
counties with greater aquifer coverage employed a larger share of the population in agriculture to
begin with, though this did not change over time in absolute terms. In relative terms, however,
counties with greater aquifer coverage remained more agricultural in their workforce in a context
of long-term secular decline in farm employment. In the Great Plains, 13 percent of the working
population was employed in agricultural occupations in the 1990s, down from 51 percent in the
1930s. In this context, retention of an additional five percentage points of the workforce in the
demonstrates this by taking the natural log of the agricultural employment variable so that
coefficients have a percent change interpretation. These results suggest that the increasing capital
intensity of farming, together with the entrenchment of local economic dependence upon the
agricultural sector, plausibly played an important role in the increasing electoral conservatism of
counties more impacted by the post-war irrigation technology shock as a result of greater overlap
with the Ogallala aquifer.
But could the conservative electoral shift in counties with greater aquifer coverage be explained
by alternative mechanisms? One explanation for rural conservatism, the race-related polarization
that led to party realignment in the US south following the civil rights movement and the passage
of the voting rights act, does not appear to be very relevant in this context. Those processes
gained steam in the 1960s, whereas analyses of the timing of effects suggest that counties with
greater aquifer coverage started to shift in a conservative electoral direction relative to counties
with less nearly 20 years earlier beginning in the 1940s. Moreover, due to the inclusion of state-
period fixed effects, all estimates are identified from within-state comparisons, so broad regional
or state-level realignments cannot be driving the increase in conservative voting in areas
impacted by the new irrigation technologies.
One of the best cross-sectional predictors of county-level voting patterns is a county’s population
density (Rodden 2019). Could the results be driven by a process of de-population and de-
urbanization, as improved agriculturally productivity keeps places relatively more rural? This is
with greater aquifer coverage experienced a modest relative decline in their levels of population
density over time relative to counties with less aquifer coverage, though they were slightly less
greater aquifer experienced a relative improvement in urbanization (the percent of the population
living in census-defined urban areas) over time, plausibly due to the formation of small towns in
areas of intensive agriculture. These set of results do not support the idea that the conservative
shift was driven by intrinsic differences in the degree of rurality as measured with differences in
population density or urbanization rates.
Finally, could the conservative shift be explained by the spread of social conservatism in rural
places? Column (5) looks at decadal associations between aquifer coverage religiosity as proxied
by the church membership per capita, computed by summing county-level membership reported
by all churches and religious bodies to religious censuses and dividing by the total county
population as reported in the next decennial census. The coefficients reveal a modest but
statistically insignificant relative increase in religiosity, casting doubt on this channel. To the
extent that we observe some relative increase in the religiosity of counties with greater aquifer
coverage, this may have been a long-term feedback effect of these areas’ alignment with the
Republican party, as the following analyses demonstrate.
6. Contemporary Policy Preferences
This section assembles geo-coded survey data on contemporary policy preferences and compares
the reported preferences of individuals residing inside the Ogallala aquifer, where capital
intensive agriculture thrives as a result of the long-term legacy of the post-war irrigation
technology shock, to those of individuals residing outside of the aquifer. We utilize data from the
Cooperative Congressional Election Survey (CCES) waves conducted between 2006 and 2020
(Kuriwaki 2021), comprising tens of thousands of respondents in annual nationally
representative samples, which together provide a large sample of respondents located in the
Great Plains who can be geo-coded to the zip code level, an area of aggregation even smaller
than that of the county.
The explanatory variable is the share of a respondent’s zip code that overlies the Ogallala
aquifer. Depending upon specification we prune the sample to zip codes within 200km or 100km
distance to the boundary of the Ogallala aquifer in each state. In the preferred specification, we
use the 100km buffer and prune from the sample zip codes partially overlying the Ogallala
aquifer. We control for state-survey wave fixed effects, so that the estimates are driven by
comparisons between individuals who live in zip codes completely (but barely) within the
boundaries of the Ogallala aquifer and individuals who live in zip codes completely (but barely)
outside of the boundaries, comparing between individuals in the same state and surveyed in the
same year. All regressions are estimated by weighted least squares, utilizing cumulative survey
weights, with standard errors clustered by state-survey wave and county.
living just inside versus outside of the boundaries of the Ogallala aquifer on nine different issues
reflecting conservatism on regulation, tax and spending, and cultural issues. Column (1)-(3) of
panel D (the preferred specification) indicates that people living just inside the boundaries of the
Ogallala aquifer are about 10 percentage points more likely to express opposition to strengthened
enforcement of the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act if it costs US jobs, consistent with the
opposition of agribusiness interests to environmental regulation. They are about 6.5 percentage
points more likely to support the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which imposes health
insurance mandates on large-scale employers of hired labor. Column (3) suggests that they are 6
percentage points more likely to oppose fines for employers hiring undocumented laborers, a
practice common at agribusiness firms and farms. Some coefficients are imprecisely estimated,
though this is due to a loss of statistical power as the sample is pruned; the coefficient estimates
in Panel D are virtually identical to those of specifications (in panels A through C) which use
larger samples and report statistically significant coefficient estimates due to a greater number of
observations and smaller standard errors.
Columns (4)-(6) investigate differences in policy preferences regarding tax and spending issues.
Column (4) indicates that respondents living inside the Ogallala aquifer boundary are 10.1
percentage points more likely to support prohibiting immigrants from access to public services,
consistent with preferences for small government, especially forms of spending that would
benefit workers. Column (5) indicates that people residing inside the boundaries of the Ogallala
aquifer are relatively more likely to favor cutting spending, as opposed to raising taxes, in order
to pay for a budget deficit, also indicating a preference for small government. Column (6)
indicates that respondents living inside the Ogallala aquifer boundary are about 7.9 percentage
points more likely to support cutting government spending on welfare, a stance consistent with
opposition to redistributive taxation and spending.
Columns (7)-(9) investigate policy preferences on polarizing “culture war” issues as opposed to
purely economic issues. Column (7) indicates that respondents living inside the boundaries of the
Ogallala aquifer are about 9 percentage points more likely to oppose always giving a woman the
right to choose to have an abortion under any circumstances. Column (8) suggests that
respondents living inside versus outside of the boundary of the aquifer do not significantly differ
in their attitudes towards requiring background checks for all gun purchases. Column (9)
indicates that respondents are slightly (about 2.4 percentage points) more likely to express
opposition to affirmative action, a question that touches on issues related to race. These results
suggest that technological change may have had some spillover effects on social/moral attitudes.
This may reflect the strategic bundling of social and economic issues by political parties, and is a
topic that deserves further research.
7. Conclusion
At the turn of the twentieth century, the Great Plains were a politically centrist region which
often supported left-wing parties and politicians like those belonging to the Populist movement.
But by the end of the twentieth century, large swathes of the Great Plains had evolved into some
of the most conservative and pro-Republican areas in the United States, typifying the
conservative electoral shift that took place across rural America and that indeed has taken place
in the rural sector in other advanced capitalist economies.
What explains this puzzling transformation? In a lively debate (Bartels 2006; Frank 2007;
Gelman 2009), scholars have debated the extent to which the culture wars and other cleavages
which cut across class-based divides have contributed to the rise of rural conservatism. In this
paper, we have suggested that much of the historical rise of rural conservatism can be traced to
economic self-interest conceptualized in terms of the industries that dominate in rural areas.
Long-term technological change gave rise to increasingly capital-intensive agriculture and the
growing economic and political power of agribusiness interests which benefit from conservative
economic policies. These agricultural transformations have had far-reaching consequences,
playing a major role in the long-term transformation of rural states into red states – whose
political power is amplified by a territorial upper chamber – as well as the spatial polarization of
politics into a right-left, rural-urban divide (Cramer 2016; Grumbach, Hacker, and Pierson 2021;
Rodden 2019).
Drawing on a historical natural experiment – the post-war introduction of new irrigation
technologies which disproportionately impacted counties with greater overlap with the Ogallala
aquifer – this paper has provided causally identified evidence that technological change played a
large role in the long-term rise of rural conservatism. The legacy of the post-war irrigation
technology shock is visible from space in the circular irrigated fields that dominate land inside
the Ogallala aquifer. It is also visible in the distinctly conservative economic policy preferences
that differentiate individuals living just inside the boundaries of the Ogallala aquifer from those
living just outside.
The results indicate several pathways for future research. It is important to further explore how
affluent farmers and agribusiness interests exercise outsized political influence in rural America.
We have argued that this is due both to the “structural” power of agribusiness in rural economies
as well as the organizational advantages of land and business owners, though future qualitative
and quantitative research could provide more direct evidence on these dynamics. We have also
documented potential spillover effects of long-term technological and economic change on
social/moral attitudes, potentially due to the feedback effects of the strategic bundling of
economic and social issues by political parties. Studying the micro-dynamics of how affluence
translates into influence in rural areas, and how economic policy preferences and cultural beliefs
co-evolve, are important tasks for future empirical research.

Notes: Unit of analysis is county-period average (pre-period is 1920-1940 and post-period is 1980-2000). Re-
publican Vote is the Republican party’s share of the two-party vote in presidential, senatorial, or gubernatorial
elections, depending on specification. Aquifer is a cross-sectional measure of the share of county land overly-
ing Ogallala aquifer. Post-shock is a time dummy variable taking a value of one for the post-shock period and
zero otherwise. Control variables are per capita New Deal spending and share of county land exposed to severe
wind erosion during the Dust Bowl, interacted with time. Analysis estimated by OLS. Standard errors adjusted

Notes: Unit of analysis is county-period average (1920-1940 average comprises pre-period and 1980-2000 av-
erage comprises post period). Irrigation is average percentage of farmland that is irrigated as computed from
agricultural censuses conducted in 1920, 1925, 1930, 1935, 1940 (pre-period) and 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997
(post-period). Center pivots is computer vision estimate of center-pivot irrigation systems per 1000 sq kilo-
meters from satellite imagery averaged 1985-2000 (the variable takes a value of zero for all counties in the
pre-shock period as the technology did not exist at this time). Analysis estimated by OLS. Standard errors ad-
justed for clustering by county and state-period reported in parentheses. Conley standard errors adjusted for
serial correlation and spatial correlation within a 200km radius of county centroids reported in brackets.

Notes: Plot depicts coefficient on aquifer coverage variable interacted with decadal dummy variables, with the
1930s left out as the reference category. Vertical bars are 95% confidence intervals. Vertical axis range is plus
or minus one standard deviation of the outcome in panels A through C and two standard deviations in panel
D. All specifications control for state-year and county fixed effects and are based on 100km buffer sample of
counties. Analysis estimated by OLS. Standard errors adjusted for clustering within counties and state-years.

Notes: Unit of analysis is county-year (agricultural, population or religious census year depending on out-
come). Capitalized value is the log of the inflation-adjusted average market value of farm land and buildings.
Farm density is the number of farms per 1000 acres of county land. Population density is the number of people
per 1000 acres of county land. Urbanization is the percentage of the county population living in census-defined
urban areas. Agricultural employment is the percentage of workforce employed in agriculture. Religiosity is
church membership per capita. Data from the US Census of Religion Bodies conducted in 1926, 1936; the sur-
vey of Churches and Church Membership conducted by the National Council of Churches in 1952, 1971, 1980

1 Details of Technological Shock
1.1 Pre-existing Technology
Prior to the post-WWII irrigation technology shock, virtually no agricultural land in the Great
Plains was irrigated. What little irrigation existed was typically based on surface irrigation from
seasonal rivers and streams. As the 1920 Agricultural Census section on irrigation in Kansas put
it: “On the High Plains there is ground water, but it occurs at such great depths that the cost of
pumping is too great for a large use of water from wells. (p. 179)”
Agriculture west of the 100th meridian (most of the Great Plains), which is typically taken to
divide arid from subhumid climates in the western United States, was typically unproductive
and highly suceptible to droughts. Subsequent Homestead Acts (of 1904 and 1909) following
the original legislation enacted in 1862, revised the law to grant larger landholdings (640 acres,
equivalent to a quarter-section in the Public Land Survey System) to farmers settling lands in
the Great Plains, where it was recognized that 160 acres was too small to sustain family farms
on sub-marginal land where only uproductive dryland farming was possible.
Episodic precipitation often brought bumper crops and waves of settlement, followed by
prolonged multi-year droughts which resulted in mass farm failures and mass outmigration.
This culminated in the Dust Bowl, the combination of prolonged drought, dust storms, and soil
erosion that devastated agriculture in the region between 1930 and 1936 and resulted in mass
outmigration to more agriculturally productive regions.
The pre-existing technology for accessing groundwater was the windmill pump, which was
typically limited to drawing water from a maximum of 30 feet under the ground. The per-acre
foot cost did not justify the windmill’s deployment in large-scale crop irrigation. As one scholar
puts it: “the average windmill kit a farmer could buy from a local manufacturer cost $75 for
an eight-foot mill, $100 for a ten-foot mill, and $135 for a twelve-foot mill. As costs declined,
in 1909 a farmer could build his own reservoir and install two twelve-foot windmills with ten-
inch pumps for $330...farmers learned regretfully that their costly $330 investment might at best
water a total of eight acres...the inherent pumping limits of windmill technology were quickly
reached and did little to aid the wheat farmer on his 640-acre section.”’ .
In the 1920s, new and improved pumping technologies emerged, but remained prohibitively
expensive to provide large-scale crop irrigation. These included, for example, steam-powered
centrifugal pumps. More cost-efficient electric irrigation pumps existed, but farmers typically
lacked widespread access to electricity connections. In any case, by the time these technologies
became available in the 1920s, farmers in the Great Plains were at the beginning of a 20-year
depression in crop prices that made it uneconomical to employ either technology on a large
scale for irrigation given their still exorbitant pumping costs.

America’s arid–humid divide. Part I: The story so far." Earth Interactions 22.5 (2018): 1-22.

1930s “Dust Bowl” drought." Geophysical Research Letters 35.8 (2008).; Gregory, James Noble. American exodus:

1.3 Post-war Technology Shock
Post-WWII advances in groundwater pumping technology finally made it economical for the
typical farmer to irrigate crops on a large scale. Improved petroleum-powered groundwater
pumps based on the adaptation of used automobile engines originated in the late 1930s, but
did not become widely available until commercialization and mass production, and diffusion
through demonstration effects led to widespread uptake in areas overlying the Ogallala aquifer
the 1950s. These new pumps were much more efficient in terms of per acre-foot cost than the
pre-existing technology: "Compared to earlier operating expenses of about $6.00 per acre-foot,
the 1938 irrigator could flood his field for $3.20 to $4.50, including installed well and equipment,
interest and depreciation, and fuel and maintenance...Advances in technology would soon give
the ordinary farmer access to irrigation, but it would be two more decades before it would be
commonplace.”
The ability to draw from the Ogallala aquifer on a large scale led to a second problem – how
to distribute this water efficiently across a typical 640-acre quarter-section farm. Flood and
ditch irrigation systems were both costly to build, in terms of labor and materials, and were
also water inefficient as they depended upon immersing fields in water in a context of loamy,
permeable soils that are susceptible to rapid dissipation of moisture. A solution arrived in the
form of center-pivot irrigation, a system for irrigating large circular fields with a rotating arm
affixed with sprinklers. Designed initially to irrigate a 640-acre quarter-section (with a rotating
arm about a quarter mile in length), over time center-pivot irrigation systems evolved in scale
so that the largest units could irrigate an entire PLSS section (with a rotating arm about a half
mile in length).
The main benefit of center-pivot irrigation was that it eliminated the need to build labor-
intensive irrigation systems and was much more water efficient, providing water evenly across
large circular fields at a rate that could be controlled by the farmer. Center-pivot irrigation was
patented in 1952 by its inventor Frank Zybach and spread rapidly across the Great Plains from
the 1950s and 1960s onward. The patent for center-pivot irrigation was purchased by Valmont
in 1954, which played a major role in the commercialization, mass production and diffusion of
the new technology across the Great Plains. In the state of Nebraska, much of which intersects
with the Ogallala aquifer, a team of researchers utilizing manual counting of circular fields from
Landsat satellite imagery found that the number of center-pivot irrigation systems in the state
increased rapidly, from over 4000 in 1973 (when satellite images are first available) to nearly
10,000 in 1976.
The spread of center-pivot irrigation supplied by petroluem-powered deepwell pumps trans-
formed the Great Plains, resulting in the signature irrigated crop circles that are visible from
space as well as the quasi-industrial revolution in agriculture that made the Great Plains one
of the most agriculturally productive regions in the world. As one observer in the 1970s put it:
"What is being observed is perhaps the most significant mechanical innovation in agriculture
since the replacement of draft animals by the tractor."

3 Computer Vision Estimates of Center-pivot Irrigation
3.1 Processing Satellite Imagery in Google Earth Engine
Our goal is to count the area-normalized number of center-pivot irrigation systems in operation
in all counties in the Great Plains states in each year between 1985 and 2000 (Landsat 5 satellite
imagery becomes available from 1984 onwards). We exclude Texas, which does not use the
Public Land Survey System (PLSS) from this exercise as well as Montana and North Dakota,
which do not intersect with the Ogallala aquifer and are not a part of our empirical strategy.
Our focus is therefore on measuring the density of center-pivot irrigation technology adoption
for all counties in Oklahoma, New Mexico, Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, Wyoming, and South
Dakota between 1985 and 2000.
For each state-year, we compute a state-wide raster layer comprised of the normalized dif-
ference vegetation index (NDVI), which highlights areas of greenery and cropping. The NDVI
is defined as (NIR - R) / (NIR + R), where NIR is Near Infrared surface reflectance values and R
is Red surface reflectance values. In the case of Landsat 5, this is (Band 5 – Band 4) / (Band 5
+ Band 4). We compute this index for each pixel by taking pixel-level median values computed
from all cloud-free images of a given pixel taken between July and August in a given year. Some
pixels are missing due to cloud cover. Computing and processing this satellite imagery required
us to process and analyze terabytes of satellite imagery. All computations were performed on
the cloud in Google Earth Engine (code available on request).
We clip these state-year raster files to the extent of individual PLSS sections, rescaling each to
a 70 70 pixel image. Given Landsat 5 resolution (each pixel is 30 square meters) this is approxi-
mately the typical size in satellite imagery of a PLSS section, which is about 1 mile on a side (with
deviation). Shapefiles of PLSS sections are obtained from the Bureau of Land Management. As
part of our data pre-processing before we feed images to a convolutional neural network, we
also re-scale the NDVI index to a measure that ranges between 0 (minimum possible value) and
1 (maximum possible value).
There are a total of 621, 000 PLSS sections in each of 16 years for which we have imagery or
nearly 10 million images which we wish to make predictions about the number of center-pivot
irrigation systems contained therein. Once we have these predictions, it is possible to aggre-
gate up to the county level by counting all the center-pivot irrigation systems in PLSS sections
contained within a county, and normalizing by total land area to get a measure of the number
of center-pivots per 1000 square kilometers.
3.2 Ground Truth Annotations from the Nebraska Center-pivot Inventory
Manually counting center-pivot irrigation systems in nearly 10 million PLSS sections is beyond
human ability. As a result, we turn to tools from computer vision to automate this process.
We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes as input the 70 70 pixel image of
a PLSS section and as output makes a prediction of the number of center-pivot irrigation sys-
tems contained therein. CNNs are supervised learning algorithms and require labeled training
data where the labels represent “ground truth" estimates of the count of center-pivot irrigation
systems in an image.
To obtain ground-truth labels, we utilize a geo-coded inventory of center-pivot irrigation
systems that was compiled though hand counting of crop circles in Landsat satellite imagery
by a team of researchers for the state of Nebraska. . The inventory consists of a spreadsheet
of every center-pivot irrigation system observed manually in Landsat satellite imagery for each
year between 1972 and 1987 with longitude and latitude coordinates.
Since geo-coding was performed by hand, there is some noise in the recorded coordinates
(i.e. when coordinates are overlaid with accurately geo-referenced satellite imagery, they do
not exactly correspond to center-pivot irrigation systems). This makes certain approaches to
counting, for instance those based on dot-annotated density maps, difficult to implement.
However, it is possible to obtain highly accurate estimates of the number of center-pivot irriga-
tion systems contained within aggregated spatial units, in our case PLSS sections.
A typical PLSS section contains between 0 and 4 center-pivot irrigation systems in predictable
overlapping with our years of interest to label the count of center-pivot irrigation systems in
clipped satellite images of all PLSS sections in Nebraska, which comprises our training dataset
(N 220,000). We use a 80:20 training/testing split, stratified by county-year, where 80 percent of
the data is used for traning and validation of the CNN model and 20 percent of the data is used
to test the model’s out-of-sample predictive performance. That is, we randomly sample 20% of
all county-year pairs in Nebraska for the years 1985-1987 and allocate all images of PLSS sec-
tions taken in each of these county-year pairs to the test set and allocate the remaining images
to the training set. There are 93 counties in Nebraska observed over three years or 279 county-
year pairs; of these, 223 were allocated to the training set and 56 to the test set. This stratified
construction of a test set permits us to measure the predictive accuracy of the algorithm at two
levels: at the PLSS section and at the county-year level.
3.3 Model Architecture, Training, and Testing Accuracy
We utilize a modified version of the VGG16 network architecture to design our convolutional
neural network. We modify it in the following ways. First, we modify the input dimensions of
× ×
the model so that it takes as input the 70 70 1 dimension image (i.e. a 70 by 70 pixel image in
a single color channel) of a PLSS section. Second, we replace the softmax activation layer with a
linear activation layer so that as output the model make a continous regression estimate of the
number of center-pivots in the image. Third, since we have a relatively focused task, we replace
the two 4096 neuron dense layers at the bottom of the standard VGG16 network architecture
with a much smaller single 128 neuron dense layer. This convolutional neural network model
has a total of 14,975,937 trainable parameters.

Notes: Image represents layers of convolutional neural network which takes as input a 70 by 70 pixel image of a
PLSS section in a single channel and as output makes a linear regression estimate of the number of center-pivot
irrigation systems in the image. Our approach treats counting center-pivot irrigation systems as a regression
problem, requiring as labels only the total number of objects per training image.
Our general approach is in the spirit of “learning to count" objects in images with deep neu-
ral networks without object localization, in which counting is treated as a regression problem,
requiring as labels only the total number of objects per training image. Similar approaches have
been taken to counting objects ranging from fruits and leaves to animals in imagery. While
there may be some degree of idisyncratic error in the predictions in the case of individual PLSS
sections, as we aggregate to the county-year level, much of this prediction error ‘cancels out’
(in the sense that the variance of the sum of at least partially uncorrelated random variables
is less than the sum of their variances). This is also why we opt for a linear activation layer
that makes a continuous estimate of the number of center-pivots in supplied images rather
than softmax classification of the image into whole integer categories. Numerical over- and
under-predictions relative to an integer-valued target label contain useful information about
classification ambiguity that improves overall predictive power when we aggregate up to the
county-year level.
In terms of a loss function, we minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of predictions. The
model was trained on the Nebraska training data for a total of 10 epochs using a the Root Mean
Squared Propagation (RMSprop) optimizer and a learning rate of 1e-4. Training was imple-
mented in the keras package in R which uses TensorFlow in Python as a backend. In test data for
the state of Nebraska 1985-87, when “ground truth" labels were regressed on predicted counts
in PLSS sections in Nebraska, the coefficient on the predicted count variable was 0.98 and the
R was 0.73. This implies a high level of accuracy at the PLSS section level (for examples see
the idiosyncratic prediction error in PLSS section counts cancel each other out as we aggregate
to higher levels.
Using the trained model, we can make predictions for a massive number of PLSS sections
(approximately 10 million) across all of the Great Plains states for each year between 1985 and
2000. We then aggregate up to the county level and divide by total county land area (omitting
PLSS sections missing predictions due to cloud cover) to get a panel dataset on center-pivot
irrigation density (center-pivots/1000 sq kilometers) at the county-year level. We achieve near-
human predictive accuracy at this level. When we regress ground-truth measures (based on
manual counts from the Nebraska center-pivot inventory) of center-pivot irrigation density for
the 56 county-year pairs in Nebraska that were allocated to the test set to our computer vision
estimates of center-pivot irigation density, the coefficient on the predicted density variable is
2 2 =
1.1 and and the R is 0.94. The accuracy of our computer vision estimates is even higher (R
Below we provide images of predicted center-pivot irrigation counts at the PLSS section and
county level for Oklahoma, New Mexico, Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, Wyoming, and South
of center-pivots per 1000 square kilometers averaged between 1985 and 2000. As the map illus-
trates, center-pivot irrigation was overwhelmingly concentrated within the boundaries of the
Ogallala aquifer. Images 12-18 provide state-by-state maps of center-pivot irrigation counts at
the PLSS section level and then aggregated to the county level.

4 Notes on GIS Analysis
4.1 Source of Shapefiles
To measure county boundaries, we utilize shapefiles published by the IPUMS National His-
torical Geographical Information System (NHGIS). NHGIS provides decennial shapefiles of
county boundaries. These files contain polygons representing county boundaries at 10-year
intervals corresponding to population censuses.
To measure the boundaries of the Ogallala aquifer, we utilize a shapefile produced by the
US Geological Survey. . This shapefile contains a polygon representing the boundaries of the
Ogallala aquifer, as synthesized from a range of historical and local geological surveys.
4.2 Software and Packages Used in GIS Analysis
All GIS and spatial analyses are performed in the R programming language. The rgdal package
is used to load, store, and project shapefiles into a coordinate reference system (WGS84 is used
throughout).
The package rgeos, which provides an R interface to GEOS (an open-source C package for
analyzing spatial geometries), is used to perform spatial operations, including computation of
county centroids and the intersection county and aquifer boundaries in order to compute the
degree to which a county overlaps with the Ogallala aquifer.
The packages geosphere is used to measure spatial distances and areas. This package is used
to compute the geodesic distance of county centroids from the Ogallala aquifer boundary in
each state as well as to compute the share of each county’s surface area that overlies the Ogallala
aquifer.
4.3 Defining Stable County Boundaries
To identify counties that possessed “stable" boundaries between 1920 and 2000, we compute
polygons representing the union and intersection of the boundary of a given county (identified
by name and ICPSR code) in 1920 and in 2000. If the county exists in both years and the inter-
section is at least 99 percent of the union in terms of land area, it is considered to have stable
boundaries over this time period (and not if either condition is not satisfied).

Notes: Map represents Soil Conservation Service’s estimates of areas exposed to different degrees of soil erosion
by 1937. Exposure to the Dust Bowl is defined as the share of county land exposed to severe wind erosion based
on geo-referenced map. This map was geo-referenced in ArcGIS and polygons were manually constructed to
represent areas of "severe wind erosion" in the Great Plains states. The measure of exposure to the Dust Bowl
is the share of county land that was exposed to severe wind erosion according to this measure. For comparable
analyses, see: Hornbeck, Richard. "The enduring impact of the American Dust Bowl: Short-and long-run
