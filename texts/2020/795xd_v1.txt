Abstract
To understand what is driving individual differences in voting intentions in a large German
sample, we investigated the predictability of voting intentions from the Big Five personality
domains, facets, and nuances, thereby tackling shortcomings of previous studies.
Using random forest analyses in a dataset of N = 4,286 individuals (46.01% men),
separate models were trained to predict intentions to i) not vote versus to vote, ii) vote for a
specific party, and iii) vote for a left- versus right-from-the-center party from either the Big
Five personality domains, facets, or nuances (represented by individual items).
Except for intentions to not vote versus to vote, balanced accuracies to predict voting
intentions marginally exceeded those achieved by a baseline learner always predicting the
majority class. Using nuances over facets and domains slightly increased balanced
accuracies.
Results indicate that additional variables should be considered to accurately predict
voting intentions, at least in German samples.

Introduction
Voting is a civil right in democracies around the world. By voting, citizens have the
power to influence political developments. Therefore, understanding what underlies voting
decisions and political preferences is an important aim in several fields of research like
political science and psychology. With regard to personality psychology, previous findings
indicate weak associations between the Big Five personality domains and, for example,
political left- vs right-positioning and party preferences, accordingly (Krieger et al., 2019).
However, it is unclear whether it is possible to accurately predict one’s current voting
intentions and preferences for a specific party from broad personality traits. Moreover, it is
unclear whether narrower personality traits, facets and nuances, can enhance predictive
accuracy over Big Five personality domains. Investigating these questions is especially
interesting in countries like Germany, where the party system is more complex than in, for
example, the USA or the UK. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate whether one
can predict Germans’ voting intentions from self-reported Big Five personality domains,
facets, and nuances by means of random forest analyses.
The Personality Trait Hierarchy
Personality traits constitute a pool of hierarchically organized characteristics, with the
Big Five personality domains of Openness (to Experience), Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (Costa & McCrae, 1992; Goldberg, 1990; Tupes & Christal,
1992) at one of the highest levels. High scores in Openness describe individuals who are open
for emotions and aesthetics, like to make new experiences, and are intellectually curious.
Individuals scoring high in Conscientiousness carry out their duties carefully, are orderly,
ambitious, and disciplined. Highly extraverted individuals are socially outgoing, tend to feel
positive emotions, and are active and assertive. High scores in Agreeableness indicate that a
person is helpful, altruistic, forgiving, and considerate. High Neuroticism describes
individuals who are anxious, hostile, impulsive, and might show depressive tendencies
(Rammstedt & Danner, 2017).
Each of the Big Five personality domains can be split into different narrower aspects
also called facets, although there is no consensus yet regarding an exhaustive set of facets
(Costa & McCrae, 1992; DeYoung et al., 2007; John et al., 1991; Rammstedt & Danner,
2017). It has been demonstrated that facets are not just different ways of expressing the Big
Five personality domains but reflect unique personality characteristics (Jang et al., 1998) and
that they often provide incremental predictive value over the Big Five personality domains
(Judge et al., 2013; Paunonen & Ashton, 2001). Below facets, many individual questionnaire
items also contain reliable and valid trait information beyond what they share with other
items (Mõttus et al., 2020). That is, many items represent unique personality traits, often
called nuances, that are narrower than facets and domains (McCrae, 2015; McCrae & Mõttus,
2019; Mõttus, Kandler, et al., 2017) and show unique predictive validity (Seeboth & Mõttus,
2018).
As a result, it seems advisable to compare different levels of the personality trait
hierarchy in terms of predictive accuracy when exploring the links of personality with other
variables, such as voting intentions. In some cases, the Big Five personality domains may
provide just as accurate predictions as lower levels of the trait hierarchy, but the reverse is
more likely (Mõttus, Bates, et al., 2017; Mõttus et al., 2020).
Personality Traits and Political Attitudes
When investigating voting intentions, a first step includes examination of intentions to
not vote vs to vote. The few previous studies investigating associations between Big Five
personality domains and non-voting vs voting intentions as well as non-voting vs voting
behavior/self-reported voter turnout have reported inconclusive results. The mixed findings
might be due to differences in voting settings (e.g., countries and years) as well as specific
measures used. Hence, the results might only be applicable to the specific samples under
investigation (Dawkins, 2017; Mondak et al., 2010; Mondak & Halperin, 2008; Sindermann
et al., 2020).
In contrast, results on associations between Big Five personality domains and political
ideology (which is likely to be associated with voting (intentions) for a specific party) are
more conclusive, especially regarding the Openness and Conscientiousness domains. While
Openness has been positively associated with a more left-leaning and liberal ideological self-
positioning, Conscientiousness has been positively associated with a more right-leaning and
conservative self-positioning (Cooper et al., 2013; Gerber et al., 2011; Hirsh et al., 2010;
Krieger et al., 2019; Mondak & Halperin, 2008; Sibley et al., 2012). The effects of the
Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism domains are usually smaller, are not as often
replicated, and the sizes and directions of effects vary between studies (Cooper et al., 2013;
Hirsh et al., 2010; Krieger et al., 2019; Mondak & Halperin, 2008).
Results of two meta-analyses on German samples support the mentioned associations
with the Openness and Conscientiousness domains. Moreover, these studies report smaller
effects of Agreeableness (in one of the meta-analyses) and Neuroticism (in both meta-
analyses), which were both related to higher left-leaning and lower conservative ideological
self-positioning (Krieger et al., 2019; Sibley et al., 2012). These findings support the
existence of associations between personality, especially the Openness and Conscientiousness
domains, and political ideology in Germany and lead to the assumption that personality might
also be associated with voting intentions for specific parties.
In Germany, there are currently six parties/party alliances included in the Bundestag,
the German federal parliament. Three of them are seen as right-from-the-center parties/party
alliances, namely the AfD (Alternative for Germany), the CDU/CSU (party alliance of the
Christian Democratic Union of Germany and the Christian Social Union in Bavaria), and the
FDP (Free Democratic Party). The other three parties, Bündnis 90/Die Grünen (Alliance
90/The Greens), SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany), and DIE LINKE (The Left) are
described as left-from-the-center parties/party alliances (Volkens et al., 2020). More
specifically, the AfD is seen as a right-wing populist party and shows critical attitudes on
immigration related topics (Berbuir et al., 2015; Lewandowsky, 2015). The CDU/CSU is
seen as a conservative, center-right party alliance and – at the time of data collection – the
chancellor, Angela Merkel, was a member of the CDU. The FDP supports economic liberal
positions plus restrictive attitudes on refugee and European politics, which makes it a party
voted by many individuals with higher incomes. Bündnis 90/Die Grünen was long time
mostly associated with environmental politics. The SPD pronounces the values of freedom,
justice, and solidarity. Finally, DIE LINKE has been described as left-wing populist party
(see Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung (2017), Expatica (2020), Schleunes et al. (2020),
and/or Volkens et al. (2020) for information on German parties).
Associations between the Big Five personality domains and voting intentions and
attitudes towards specific parties in the German context have been investigated before. One
study found highest scores in Openness in individuals who would vote for Bündnis 90/Die
Grünen in comparison to putative voters of the other major German parties (Sindermann et
al., 2020). Lowest scores in Openness were found in individuals who stated that they would
vote for the CDU/CSU; only individuals who indicated they would not vote showed lower
scores. At the same time, putative voters of the CDU/CSU showed highest scores in
Conscientiousness. Lowest scores in Conscientiousness were observed in individuals who
stated they would vote for DIE LINKE. However, not all of the differences between groups
were statistically significant (Sindermann et al., 2020). Another study found that
Conscientiousness was negatively related to voting for left-from-the-center parties
(specifically, the SPD and Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) and positively to voting for right-from-
the-center parties (specifically, the CDU/CSU). Openness showed the opposite pattern of
associations (Vecchione et al., 2011). Findings from a third study among others support a
positive correlation between Openness and attitudes towards left-from-the-center German
parties; specifically, the SPD, Bündnis 90/Die Grünen, and the PDS (a precursor party of DIE
LINKE). At the same time, Openness was negatively related to attitudes towards the
CDU/CSU and the FDP, hence, right-from-the-center parties. Conscientiousness showed the
opposite pattern of associations, except the link to attitudes towards the FDP, which was non-
significant (Schoen & Schumann, 2007). The associations between party preferences and
other Big Five personality domains were either mixed or non-significant in the cited studies.
The Current Study
The Big Five personality domains appear to be descriptively associated with non-
voting vs voting and voting intentions/preferences for specific parties in the German context:
while associations with non-voting vs voting are inconclusive, Openness seems to be
associated with preferences for left-from-the-center parties and Conscientiousness seems to
be associated with preferences for right-from-the-center parties. However, since effect sizes
are often rather small, it remains unknown whether it is possible to predict one’s voting
intentions (non-voting vs voting and voting for a specific party) from the Big Five personality
domains. Descriptions and predictions are not the same (Mõttus et al., 2020). While
descriptive modeling documents associations between variables in a given sample, predictive
research constructs models with the aim to predict observations in an independent sample:
that is, prediction models are “trained” and tested in independent (sub)samples. Successful
predictions require that the associations are not overfitted and are sufficiently robust to
generalize beyond idiosyncrasies of particular samples and their compositions (Mõttus et al.,
2020; Yarkoni & Westfall, 2017). Results relying on predictive analysis might resolve some
problems of previous research, such as lack of generalizability, and might help to overcome
non-replicable findings. Moreover, the predictive associations between lower levels of the
personality trait hierarchy and voting intentions in the German multiparty context have not
yet been explored. It is possible that constructing prediction models based on Big Five
personality facets and nuances will yield more accurate predictions than those based on the
Big Five personality domains. However, it is important that such comparative studies account
for model overfitting, because more complex models automatically account for more variance
in their outcome than comparatively simpler models: training and validating models in
independent samples is a particularly effective way of achieving this (Mõttus & Rozgonjuk,
2021; Seeboth & Mõttus, 2018; Yarkoni & Westfall, 2017)
For the present work, we chose to implement random forest analyses. This approach
differs from, for example, different kinds of regression analyses for classification problems
(e.g., binomial/binary logistic, multinomial logistic) in many ways. Of importance for the
present work, the non-parametric random forest algorithm i) does not assume linear relations
between predictor and criterion variables, ii) can deal with a large number of intercorrelated
predictors, iii) is robust against outliers, and iv) combinations of predictor variables are
automatically considered, thus, also combinations of variables not expected by the
researchers are taken into account (Buskirk & Kolenikov, 2015; Lingjun et al., 2019; Mendez
et al., 2008; Stachl et al., 2020).
In conclusion, the present study aimed at investigating the aforementioned
associations by means of random forest analyses in a German sample. We had no predefined
hypotheses with regards to predictions of intentions to not vote vs to vote. Regarding voting
intentions for a specific party (leaning), Openness and Conscientiousness were expected to be
the most important predictors. No hypotheses were built for Big Five personality facets or
nuances given the lack of existing literature.

Sample
By means of two online surveys, we recruited a convenience sample of N = 4,286
individuals (n = 1,972 men, n = 2,307 women, n = 7 “third gender”) eligible to be included in
the present analyses (see Supplementary Material I for details on data collection and data
cleaning).
Self-Report Measures
Big Five Inventory
The Big Five personality traits were assessed by applying the Big Five Inventory
(BFI; John et al., 1991) in German language (Rammstedt & Danner, 2017). It consists of 45
items but the 45th item is unique to the German version. It was not included in our analyses
based on previous studies in the German context including the original validation study of the
German BFI (Rammstedt & Danner, 2017; Sindermann et al., 2020) and to enable closer
comparability with studies applying the English version of the BFI. All items of the
questionnaire are answered on a 5-point Likert-scale from 1 = “very inapplicable” to 5 =
“very applicable”. Next to the broad Big Five personality domains, two facets of each Big
Five personality domain can be calculated. These facets are labeled Openness for aesthetics,
Openness for ideas (Openness); Order, Self-discipline (Conscientiousness); Assertiveness,
Activity (Extraversion); Altruism, Compliance (Agreeableness); Anxiety, Depression
(Neuroticism). Psychometric properties are detailed in Supplementary Material I.
Current Voting Intentions
Individuals stated which party they would vote for if general elections would be held
the following Sunday. Response options were CDU/CSU (n = 586, 13.67%), SPD (n = 331,
7.72%), Bündnis 90/Die Grünen (n = 1,769, 41.27%), FDP (n = 292, 6.81%), DIE LINKE (n
= 412, 9.61%), AfD (n = 187, 4.36%), “others” (n = 464, 10.83%) – indicating voting for
smaller parties not currently included in the German federal parliament – and “I would not
vote” (n = 245, 5.72%); percentages do not add up to 100% due to rounding.
Statistical Analyses
Main Analyses
The statistical software R version 4.1.0 (R Core Team, 2018) and RStudio version
1.4.1106 (RStudio Team, 2020) were used for all analyses. Packages used for the analyses are
listed in the Supplementary Material and the R-script. First, we calculated descriptive
statistics of the BFI on domain, facet, and item level (see Supplementary Material I).
Next, we trained random forest models to predict intentions i) to not vote vs to vote
and ii) to vote for specific parties from either Big Five i) domains, ii) facets, or iii) items (6
models in total). More specifically, we implemented a 10-times repeated 10-fold cross-
validation procedure. Thus, we split the total sample into ten different folds of equal size (and
with equal distributions of the respective criterion variable) ten times; thus, a total of 100
different folds were built across repeats. Moreover, we needed to account for class imbalance
in the criterion variables. Prominent methods to deal with imbalanced data are weighting and
over-/under-sampling (Chen et al., 2004). We applied a weighting procedure to put heavier
costs on misclassifications in the minority class and decrease prediction errors of the minority
class, accordingly. Specifically, weights were set indirectly proportional to the class sizes by
applying the following formula: class weight of class x = n(majority class) / n(class x)
(Breiman & Cutler, n.d.). We used the default setting for the number of trees (n = 500),
splitting rule (“gini”), and the numbers of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each
split (square root of number of predictor variables) in all models.
The results across folds and repeats were averaged. More specifically, we extracted
mean accuracies across folds and repeats and compared these to the No Information Rate
(NIR), which is the accuracy derived from always predicting the majority class (i.e.,
percentage of observations in the majority class). Additionally, we computed the mean
balanced accuracies ((sensitivity + specificity) / 2) from the confusion matrices derived from
the 10-times repeated 10-fold cross-validations. Balanced accuracies are of importance in this
specific work given the imbalanced class distributions and because the balanced accuracy
weights performance of the model for each class equally. Next, we calculated the respective
misclassification errors from the confusion matrices across repeated cross-validation. Finally,
variable importance scores derived from the final models were extracted and are presented in
Supplementary Material I.
The procedure was applied to predict all criterion variables (intentions i) to not vote vs
to vote and ii) to vote for specific parties) by either Big Five personality domains, facets, or
nuances in separate models.
Additional Analyses
We additionally ran the same analyses to predict intentions to vote for left- vs right-from-
the-center parties. Grouping of parties into left and right was implemented according to
Volkens et al. (2020): left: DIE LINKE, SPD, Bündnis 90/Die Grünen; right: FDP,
CDU/CSU, AfD. This investigation was not planned from the beginning but was data driven.
Specifically, it was based on the imbalance in the aforementioned criterion variables. By
splitting voting intentions into two groups with intentions to vote for a left- vs right-from-the-
center party, we aimed at receiving more balanced classes and to counteract problems of
majority class voting. We still applied the weighting procedure (detailed above) for
consistency with other analyses.
Finally, results of binomial/binary logistic regression analyses to predict intentions to i)
not vote vs to vote, ii) vote for a specific party (one-vs-all approach), and iii) vote for left- vs
right-from-the-center parties are presented in Supplementary Material II for easier
interpretation of effects of single predictors.
Results
Predicting Intentions to Not Vote versus to Vote
The mean accuracies across the 10-times repeated 10-fold cross-validations to predict
intentions to not vote vs to vote were 92.94% (SD = 0.01) for the models comprising Big Five
personality domains, 93.97% (SD = 0.00) for the models comprising facets, and 94.25% (SD
= 0.00) for the models comprising items. Thus, all mean accuracies were lower than the NIR,
which was 94.28% in the total sample (thus, roughly the same in each fold).
Mean balanced accuracies across the 10-times repeated 10-fold cross-validations were
49.87%, 49.97%, and 49.98% for the models comprising Big Five personality domains,
facets, and items, respectively. Thus, all mean balanced accuracies were lower than the
balanced accuracy of 50.00% which would be achieved by a model always predicting the
majority class.

Predicting Intentions to Vote for a Specific Party within Putative Voters
Mean accuracies across the 10-times repeated 10-fold cross-validations to predict intentions
to vote for a specific party were 23.40% (SD = 0.02), 27.39% (SD = 0.02), and 34.63% (SD =
0.02) when including Big Five personality domains, facets, or items as predictors in the
models, respectively. Thus, all accuracies were below the NIR of 43.78%.
Mean balanced accuracies across the 10-times repeated 10-fold cross-validations and
across all classes were 51.48% for the models built based on Big Five personality domains,
51.96% for the models comprising facets, and 52.71% for the models comprising items. For
each individual class and across the 10-times repeated 10-fold cross-validations, the balanced
accuracies lied between 49.08% (“others”) and 53.48% (“CDU/CSU”), between 48.58%
(“SPD”) and 54.16% (“DIE LINKE”), and between 50.20% (“FDP”) and 55.74%
(“CDU/CSU”) for the models comprising Big Five personality domains, facets, and items,
respectively. Thus, balanced accuracies of the predictions of voting intentions for most
parties as well as mean balanced accuracies across all parties exceeded the balanced accuracy
of 50.00%, which would be achieved by a model always predicting the majority class. More
specifically, this was true for voting intentions for all parties except the SPD and “other”
parties when predictions were based on domains, for all parties except the SPD when
predictions were based on facets, and for all parties when predictions were based on items.

Predicting Intentions to Vote for Left- versus Right-from-the-Center Parties within
Putative Voters of One of the Six Major German Parties
When predicting intentions to vote for left- vs right-from-the-center parties, mean
accuracies across 10-times repeated 10-fold cross-validations were 64.15% (SD = 0.02),
65.16% (SD = 0.02), and 68.85% (SD = 0.02) when using Big Five personality domains,
facets, or items in the prediction models, respectively. These accuracies were all lower than
the NIR of 70.23%.
Balanced accuracies across the 10-times repeated 10-fold cross-validations were
56.40% for predictions from Big Five personality domains, 55.87% for predictions from
facets, and 57.70% for predictions from items. Thus, balanced accuracies of these models
exceeded the balanced accuracy of 50.00% achieved by a model always predicting the
majority class.

Discussion
The present study aimed to investigate the predictability of voting intentions of German
individuals from Big Five personality domains, facets, and nuances (indexed by individual
items).
Results showed that intentions to not vote vs to vote could not be predicted better than
by a baseline learner/model always predicting the majority class (i.e., “voter”).
Regarding the prediction of intentions to vote for a specific party, mean prediction
accuracies across repeated cross validations ranged from 23.40% for the models comprising
Big Five personality domains to 34.63% for the models comprising nuances. All of these
accuracies were below the NIR. In this realm, it is important to note that accurate predictions
of individuals’ voting intentions in multi-party systems are difficult to achieve; this has also
been observed in other studies. One study using all political Facebook likes of individuals,
thus, variables much closer related to voting intentions than personality traits, reports a
prediction accuracy of around 60% (Kristensen et al., 2017). Nevertheless, mean balanced
accuracies for predictions of intentions to vote for a specific party observed in the present
work were – in parts – higher than the mean balanced accuracy of 50.00%; a balanced
accuracy of 50.00% is achieved by a model always predicting the majority class. Due to the
class imbalance in the present sample, balanced accuracies are of special interest because the
performance of the model in predicting each class is weighted equally. Voting for the
Christian religion oriented and conservative party alliance of CDU/CSU (from Big Five
personality domains and nuances) and for the left-wing party DIE LINKE (from Big Five
personality facets) showed highest balanced accuracies exceeding 50.00% (Bundeszentrale
für politische Bildung, 2017; Volkens et al., 2020). Moreover, the mean balanced accuracies
across classes and across 10-times repeated 10-fold cross-validations were exceeding 50.00%
for predictions from Big Five personality domains, facets, and nuances. This indicates that
voting for specific parties can – to a certain degree – be predicted by personality at different
levels of the trait hierarchy when weighting the performance to predict each class equally; but
not of overall accuracies as compared to the NIR.
For predictions of intentions to vote for left- vs right-from-the-center parties, mean
prediction accuracies across repeated cross-validations ranged from 64.15% for models
comprising Big Five personality domains to 68.85% for models comprising nuances. Again,
all of these accuracies were below the NIR. However, balanced accuracies ranged from
55.87% for predictions from Big Five personality facets, to 57.70% for prediction models
based on nuances. Hence, the balanced accuracies were – again – exceeding the balanced
accuracy of 50.00% achieved by a model always predicting the majority class.
Regarding the aim of the present study to test whether Big Five personality facets and
nuances exhibit higher predictive accuracies compared to domains, the overall answer would
be: no and yes. For a more elaborate discussion on this, we compare the balanced accuracies
across 10-times repeated 10-fold cross-validations of models derived from Big Five
personality domains, facets, and nuances. Moreover, we focus on the prediction of voting
intentions for specific parties and for left- vs right-from-the-center parties since only models
to predict these variables exceeded a balanced accuracy of 50.00%. As can be seen in the
results section, the mean balanced accuracies were highest for models based on Big Five
personality nuances. However, the balanced accuracies for models based on Big Five
personality facets were roughly the same, once even lower, compared to models based on Big
Five personality domains. Thus, using nuances increased balanced accuracies of predictions
in comparison to using domains and facets; but the increase was only around 1.8% at most.
The finding that models based on Big Five personality facets did barely exhibit higher
balanced accuracies of predictions over models based on domains might be due to the
following fact: in the specific questionnaire applied in this study, not all items are included in
facets; but domains and single-item analyses comprise all 44 items (see Supplementary
Material I for an overview on which items do and do not belong to a certain facet and a
certain domain). Items not included in facets might play a role in the prediction.
Importantly, what is understood as satisfying prediction performance is to a certain
degree subjective. Similarly, whether the overall accuracy or the balanced accuracy of a
model is considered when evaluating prediction performance is a subjective decision.
Therefore, we transparently present both accuracy measures. Nevertheless, it is clear that the
predictions of intentions to not vote vs to vote based on the present models were not better
than predictions of a baseline learner/model always predicting the majority class: accuracies
consistently lied below the NIR and the balanced accuracies consistently lied below 50.00%.
Regarding the prediction of voting intentions for a specific party and for left- vs right-from-
the-center parties, the present results (regarding accuracies and balanced accuracies) indicate
that additional variables need to be taken into account in order to increase the prediction
performance (see further discussion below). The fact that accuracies did not exceed the NIR
but balanced accuracies exceeded the 50.00% threshold indicates that the algorithms used in
the present study might overall perform better in samples with more balanced class
distributions.
To judge on the effect sizes found in the present study (for voting for a specific party
or left- vs right-from-the-center parties), we would like to take into account effect sizes
reported in other related studies. As such, the correlation between Big Five personality
domains and voting for center-right vs center-left parties in the study by Vecchione et al.
(2011) ranged from |.12| to |.24| in the German sample. In a meta-analysis on associations
between the Big Five personality domains and political ideology in German samples, the
highest correlation was |.07| (Krieger et al., 2019). These effect sizes derived from previous
studies together with the imbalanced class distributions might explain why accuracies of none
of the present models did exceed the NIR (but please see interpretation of balanced
accuracies). Moreover, these results indicate that personality does not seem to play a major
role in predicting voting intentions. Putatively, one’s voting intention is a complex
psychological construct and many different variables and their interactions might contribute
to it; each with a small singular effect. Thus, taking into account more variables to predict
voting intentions, like socio-demographics (Nier, 2017) or political attitudes such as attitudes
towards refugees (Igarashi, 2021), might improve the prediction. However, for the federal
elections in 2017 in Germany, nearly 62,000,000 individuals were eligible to vote (Der
Bundeswahlleiter, 2021). On a population scale, therefore, even seemingly small effect sizes,
such as those found in the present study, can be of importance (Götz et al., 2021).
The results have important implications for current debates. As such, it is often
discussed in how far knowledge of individuals’ personality can be used to influence their
opinions, for example by microtargeting, in the political as well as economic field (Matz et
al., 2017). A prominent example from the political field is the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
Inference on, among others, the Big Five characteristics of citizens from their digital footprint
data appears to have been used to predict and manipulate voting preferences, for example in
the 2016 American presidential elections and the Brexit referendum (Wylie, 2019).
Supporting evidence that personality traits can be predicted from digital footprint data to a
certain degree comes from various studies (Kosinski et al., 2013; Marengo & Montag, 2020).
However, with regard to political attitudes and according to the results of the present study,
more variables aside from (self-reported) personality should be taken into account to improve
prediction performance – at least in the German context. If voting intentions cannot be
accurately predicted from personality traits, this makes it seem unlikely that purely
personality-based campaigning effectively influences one’s voting intentions. However, by
taking into account more variables (see above) the prediction of voting intensions might be
improved. In line with this, also Cambridge Analytica did putatively not use knowledge on
the Big Five personality traits exclusively.
Finally, some limitations of the present study need to be mentioned. First, the sample was
not representative of the general German population. The distribution of current voting
intentions observed in the present sample did neither reflect the election outcome from the
federal elections 2017, nor the distributions found in general population samples in the time
of data collection (Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung, 2018; Guttmann, 2020). This might
limit generalizability of findings. Moreover, the imbalance in the class sizes of the criterion
variables seem to have posed a problem. Next, the current sampling procedure was focused
on individuals from Germany. However, we did not specifically ask whether participants
were eligible to vote in the general German elections. Even if unlikely, it is possible that
some of the study participants are German residents, but are not eligible to vote, e.g., because
they are not citizens. Moreover, the present study is limited to one self-report measure of the
Big Five. We therefore call for future studies reinvestigating the present research questions
using different Big Five measures to test replicability of results across different
measurements. Similarly, longer questionnaires assessing more nuances and facets of the Big
Five might give more detailed insights. In the same vein, also applying different algorithms
with different tuning parameter settings might lead to (slightly) different results. Next, it is
also important to note that in general German elections, one has two votes – one to vote for a
specific candidate from one’s electoral district to become a member of the Bundestag and one
for a specific party. In line with common surveys of professional research institutes on voting
preferences (Willkow & Cantow, 2020), we focused on the second vote in the present study.
Another limitation of the present study is that the generalizability of the findings is
necessarily limited to the German context. Applicability of the findings to other countries
must be tested in future studies.
Conclusion
This study sheds light on the predictability of voting intentions by Big Five personality
domains, facets, and nuances in the German context. The differentiation between German
individuals with the intention to not vote vs to vote was not possible. The predictions of
voting intentions for specific parties or for parties on the left vs right side of the spectrum was
barely possible. The prediction accuracies might be improved by adding more variables to the
models. Still, the accuracies of predictions from models based on Big Five personality
nuances were slightly higher than predictions from models based on Big Five personality
facets and domains.
