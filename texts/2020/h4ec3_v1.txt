RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
Abstract
Prevalent models of eye movement control in reading of word-spaced orthographies assume a
discrete control account to explain word skipping. Accordingly, word skipping results from
advanced parafoveal word activation during preview, leading to the selection of word n+2 as a
saccade target. Consequently, visual and linguistic content of the parafoveal word affect which
word is selected as a saccade target. In contrast, according to dynamic adjustment view, saccade
lengths in reading are affected by current and next word properties in a continuous manner. First,
these predictions were confirmed via simulations for representative models of discrete and
dynamic control. Then results of three gaze-contingent invisible boundary experiments studying
the visuo-attentional mechanism of skipping are being reported. The results support the dynamic
adjustment view by showing a unimodal landing position distribution across a candidate word for
skipping and its subsequent word, and that the content of parafoveal word modulates the saccade
length only slightly and in a continuous manner. In addition, the location of a visual anomaly
within a word had no effect on saccade length, suggesting that parafoveal vision of next word is
subject of attention enhancement early enough to affect saccade length computation.

invisible boundary experiments
1.1 Discrete or dynamic adjustment control of saccade lengths?
Despite of considerable differences, prevalent models of eye movement control in reading
of word-spaced orthographies (Reichle et al., 1999; Reichle & Sheridan, 2015, Engbert et al.,
2005; Risse et al., 2014; Reilly & Radach, 2006; Snell et al., 2018b; see also Brysbaert & Vitu,
1998) share the assumption of a two-stage process concerning the computation of progressive
inter-word saccade length: First, lexical processes related to current and upcoming words
determine which word will be selected as a target word for a saccade. The saccade is then targeted
to the center of the selected word, as the center provides an optimal viewing position for parallel
letter processing during word recognition (McConkie et al., 1988). This intended saccade length is
affected by a systematic error towards preferred saccade length of seven letters (McConkie et al.,
1988). The resulting saccade range effect (or systematic error) has been implemented into most
computational models, including EZ Reader (Reichle et al., 1999; Reichle & Sheridan, 2015),
SWIFT (Engbert et al., 2005; Risse et al., 2014), Glenmore (Reilly & Radach, 2006), and OB1
(Snell et al., 2018b). Finally, random oculomotor error proportional to the intended saccade
length is added. Due to the initial target word selection -stage, the above depicted traditional view
is labelled hereafter as discrete control account of saccade length.
However, selecting saccade target word on the basis of lexical information is difficult in
comparison to planning saccades on the basis of readily available lower-level information, such as
word spaces. First of all, the vision gradient (i.e. combination of visual acuity and visual crowding
[Bouma, 1970] influences), is the main determinant of saccade lengths as indexed by the effect of
word’s spatial width on relative landing position, skipping and refixation probabilities (Hautala et
al., 2011; Hautala & Loberg, 2015; McDonald, 2006; Hermena et al., 2017). The somewhat blurry
parafoveal preview may nevertheless activate representations at multiple levels of the cognitive
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
hierarchy, from the visual to the semantic (Schotter et al., 2012). However, the eyes seem not to
wait for the possible activation of high-level representations of previewed word but launch the
next saccade primarily contingent on the recognition of the foveal word (for a review, see Schotter
et al., 2012; Brothers et al., 2017). This induces a great time pressure for parafoveal activations to
affect saccade programming, possibly impeding the readers’ ability to make routinely lexical-level
skipping decisions.
A logical alternative to the discrete control is a dynamic control of saccade length,
suggesting that saccade length is dynamically adjusted according to the properties of current and
upcoming words. The foundation of a dynamic control lies in the critique of the saccadic range
effect (Nuthmann et al., 2016; Cutter et al., 2017). It has been criticized that McConkie et al.
(1988) studied only interword saccades from word n to word n+1, therefore neglecting the
influence of refixations and skipping saccades on the saccade length computation (see Yao-N'Dré
et al., 2014). Vitu and colleagues have thoroughly analyzed saccade control in reading including
also refixation and skipping saccades by predicting saccade length or landing position with launch
distance to next word and its length (Albrengues et al., 2019; Yang & Vitu, 2007; Yao-N'Dré et
al., 2014). The conclusion that can be drawn from these studies is that readers tend to proceed with
much more uniform saccade lengths than what would be expected on the basis of interword
saccades only. Moreover, Vitu has argued that saccade lengths are dynamically adjusted, that is, in
a continuous manner without the involvement of a target word selection process, even in word-
spaced orthographies (Yang & Vitu, 2007). In fact, there is also direct empirical evidence that
linguistic properties of upcoming word are used at very least to fine-tune interword saccade
lengths also in alphabetic orthographies (Hyönä et al., 2018; Radach et al., 2004; Albrengues et
al., 2019). Importantly, it should be noted that the dynamic adjustment models already exist for
non-spaced orthographies, such as Chinese (for a computational model, see: Liu et al., 2017a-b).
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
Recently, a novel dynamic adjustment view of eye movement control in reading for word-
spaced orthographies was introduced (Cutter et al., 2017, 2018). According to this center-based
saccade length (CBSL) -account, saccade lengths are computed as follows: First, when
previewing upcoming words, the distance between centers of words n+1 and n+2 are being
extracted to represent an optimal length for saccade+2 (a saccade after the next saccade). This
preliminary plan is then corrected to some extent by the actual landing position to word n+1 (i.e.
the launch distance to word n+2). Very recently, a computational implementation of the CBSL
account was found to provide equal or better fit to empirical word length effects for landing
position, skipping and refixation probability measures, relative to a “benchmark” model EZ
Reader (Anonymous, preprint; available at:
implemented as a regression model formula given by the Equation 1, which was derived from a
linear mixed model fitted to an empirical data, supplemented with an oculomotor error:
2 2
Saccade length = 3.8 + 0.53 * CD - 0.018 * CD + 0.27 * LD - 0.026 * LD + σ (1)
In Equation 1, CD is the distance between the centers of word n+1 and n+2, and LD launch
distance to the beginning of word n+2 after landing on the word n+1. The oculomotor error σ is
identical to the one used in the EZ Reader model, that is Gaussian error with mean of zero and
standard deviation increasing by 0.1 letters on the top of 0.5 intercept value for every one-letter
increase in intended saccade length, which is the result of the preceding part of the Equation 1.
Effectively, the intercept of the CBSL model (3.8 letters) sets a minimum length for
progressive saccades. The CD is the main modulator of saccade length, whereas LD is used to

correct saccade length to some extent according to actualized landing position. This correction is
made in order to land on a central viewing position of next word. The non-linear reduction in
coarse skipping of closely positioned next word. This factor may contribute to the reduction in
saccade length for skips vs. non-skips documented previously (Krügel & Engbert, 2010; Krügel
et al., 2012). Moderate launch distance, on the other hand, may allow maximal saccade lengths
because the currently fixated word can still be recognized without a refixation. Similarly, the
non-linear effect of CD produces an asymptote preventing the saccade length exceeding general

1.4. Determinants of word skipping.
Considerable amount of research has investigated to which extent skipping depends on the
parafoveal processing of next word. To avoid possibly detrimental effects of odd textual
information for overall eye movement dynamics, most of these studies have utilized a gaze-
contingent boundary paradigm, in which target words are shown with a preview mask
disappearing during a saccade that crosses the invisible boundary located at the end of the
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
preceding word (Choi & Gordon, 2014; Drieghe, 2008; Gordon et al., 2013; Reingold & Rayner,
2006; Plummer & Rayner, 2012).
First, it is well known that the majority of word skipping result from the general
oculomotor mechanisms discussed above, pushing the eyes to land just over a short word when
launched from nearby (since McConkie et al., 1988, 1989). In addition, skipping is also affected
by visual properties of the next word. Depending on their relevancy to the reading task, visually
highly anomalous word-objects may be skipped with a very high (Reingold et al., 2016) or low
probability (Drieghe, 2008; Gagl et al., 2014). These strong effects provide evidence that at least
low-frequency visuospatial information available first in the parafovea, can be used to select
saccade targets in reading-like tasks.
Extraction of high-frequency visuospatial information from parafoveal word is
compromised due to poor visual acuity. Concerning word skipping, ~5 % effect size has been
observed for faint font manipulation (Drieghe, 2008; Warrington et al., 2018). In addition, faint
font preview did not affect later foveal fixation durations of young readers (Warrington et al.,
2018), suggesting that the effects of subtle visual previews may be restricted on the early stages of
word recognition (see Reingold & Rayner, 2006).
Concerning linguistic determinants of skipping, according to the review by Brysbaert and
Vitu (1998), word frequency affects skipping rates by approximately 5% (e.g., Angele & Rayner,
2013; Angele et al., 2014) and predictability by approximately 8% (Fitzsimmons & Drieghe,
2013; Rayner et al., 2004; Slattery & Yates, 2018). Obstructing parafoveal lexical recognition
whatsoever by nonword presentation preserving overall word shape reduces skipping rates
approximately 10% (Choi & Gordon, 2014; Drieghe, 2008; Gordon et al., 2013; Plummer &
Rayner, 2012). Yet, nonword previews do disturb lexical processing initiated by the parafoveal
preview, as evidenced by inflated next fixation durations and regression rates on the target word

& Rayner, 2012).
1.5. Discrete or dynamic control of word skipping?
To the best of our knowledge, no convincing evidence for the discrete control view of
skipping has been shown in the literature. Note that the studies of Krügel et al. (2010, 2012, 2014)
were not informative about the decision process preceding skipping, but were concerned on
specifying the differences between skipping and non-skipping saccades while controlling launch
distance. In the present study, it was reasoned that discrete control should lead to bimodal
distribution of saccade lengths or landing positions corresponding to words n+1 and n+2 in a
situation where skipping is a likely to happen. Simulation with the EZ Reader model (see
Instead, according to the CBSL skips are mislocated fixations due to overshooting of a
target word. This overshooting has autocorrelative bias because overshooting the center of a
preceding word is only partially corrected. Due to lack of saccade target selection processes, the

Simulated Overall Relative Landing Position Distributions for the (a) CBSL and (b) EZ Reader
Models.
One reviewer suggested that the bimodality may appear only for certain range of word
lengths. We’d like to comment that only short words are typically candidates for skipping and
the longer the T+1 word, the clearer the bimodality should be.
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
Note: Panels A and B: Landing positions in relation to short target words (≤ 4 letters) that are highly prone to
skipping, were simulated with 1000 Monte Carlo runs on a sentence corpus (Schilling, 1998). Values 0-1 represent the
target word (T), whereas values larger than 1 represent skipping cases (T+1). To ensure that the preceding word (T-1)
was mostly intentionally fixated, it had to contain at least five letters. For providing enough space for the bimodal
distribution to appear, the T+1 had to contain at least five letters. As CBSL does not utilize the length of T+1 word in
saccade planning, results for this model are given in the scale of T. According to the Hartigan’s dip test (Hartigan,
1985) the distribution is unimodal, D = .0005, p = 1. Instead, EZ Reader results are given in the scale of T and T+1,
because either of them may be selected as a saccade target. The distribution is not unimodal, D = .013, p < .001.
Expectedly, the distribution peaks correspond to the centers of the T (0.5) and T+1 (1.5). The sharp peak at value 1.0
most likely reflect mislocated fixations targeted to word T.
According to the discrete control view, linguistic properties of next word directly affect
mechanism responsible for skipping in the EZ Reader model (e.g. Reichle et al., 2012) can be
summarized as follows: First, high-frequency spatial information from a parafoveal word is
extracted fast and in parallel while lexically processing the foveal word. As soon as the foveal
word has been recognized, attention shifts to the parafoveal word starting the first stage of lexical
processing, the “familiarity check”, consisting of orthographic processing leading to activation of
a word form. Skipping occurs if this “familiarity check” completes early enough to cancel the
default saccade to the next word – no full recognition of next word is required. Previous
simulations have shown that the model produces realistic unique effects of word length, frequency
and predictability on skipping rates (Pollatsek et al., 2006), and that the speed of “familiarity
check” is the earliest word-content related process which substantially affects saccade lengths
(Reichle et al., 2013). Assuming that subtle spatial high-frequency anomalies disrupt letter
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
encoding, the suspected locus of such manipulation is the “familiarity check”. However, as
orthographic processes are not modelled, the model makes no prediction whether a nonword
preview or subtle visual anomalies in the previewed word should inhibit skipping more.
Simulated Word Frequency and Predictability Effects on Relative Landing Position Distributions
for the EZ Reader Model.
Note: Relative landing position (RLP) values 0-1 belong to word T and values 1-2 to word T+1. Low foveal load at
word T-1 was set by excluding least frequent words (lowest fifth percentile) and to restrict word length to four to
seven letters. To restrict the inspection only to a potential skipping situation, word T had maximum of six letters.
Panel B: The word frequency effect was confounded with the predictability effect. Therefore, highly predictable T
words (highest fifth percentile) were excluded. Still, lowest frequency words (fifth percentile, 5% of cases) were
to the fourth percentile group in predictability, explaining the counterintuitive prediction altogether.
The CBSL model still lacks computational implementation of processes other than those
concerned on word length information. However, empirical studies (Hyönä et al., 2018; Radach et
al., 2004) suggest only a minor role of other information than word length and launch distance on
landing positions. For example, Hyönä et al. (2018) report landing position shifting approximately
0.13 letters to right per one log-unit increase in word frequency, whereas faint font preview
reduced progressive saccade length by 0.23 letters in young adult readers (Warrington et al.,
2018). On these bases, one may expect small and similar-sized influences for nonword and visual
dot previews on saccadic measures.
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
Finally, the discrete control should be reflected in fixation duration prior to launching a
saccade, either due parafoveal-on-foveal effects (Engbert et al., 2005; Risse et al., 2014; Reilly &
Radach, 2006; Snell et al., 2018b), or due to extra time required for saccadic reprogramming after
skipping decision (Reichle et al., 1999; Reichle & Sheridan, 2015). Empirical results in this
respect are mixed as skipping rates seem not to depend on foveal load (Drieghe et al., 2004;
Eskenazi & Folk, 2015; Rayner et al., 2011; White, 2007), and fixation duration prior skipping is
generally shorter yet may be slightly inflated for infrequent words (Kliegl & Engbert, 2005).
However, interactions between launch distance and other independent variables have seldom been
studied (White et al., 2005).
1.4. Attentional mechanisms underlying skipping.
A possible yet an unlikely scenario is that skipping is predominantly driven by vision
gradient, which mechanism should stress the importance of word beginning information in
saccade length modulation. On the other hand, it is well known that covert shift of presaccadic
attention provide temporary reduction in the crowding of the target area (for a review, see Li et al.,
2016), which explains a large part the preview benefit observed in reading (Briihl & Inhoff, 1995;
Johnson et al., 2007; see Schotter et al., 2012). However, presaccadic attention occurs too late to
modulate saccade lengths. A form of attention that is more potent to contribute to saccade-length
modulation is the early parallel processing of words (Inhoff & Radach, 2014; Inhoff et al., 2005;
Snell et al., 2018a, 2019; Wang et al., 2009). This process may explain why skipping is slightly
affected by the holistic linguistic properties of words, such as word frequency.
Few studies utilizing invisible boundary paradigm seem particularly informative about the
attentional mechanisms involved in skipping. Gagl et al. (2014) found that skipping was inhibited
similarly by previews, in which either the beginning or end of a word was subject of clear visual
degradation. The manipulation was also associated with inflated foveal fixation durations,
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
suggesting that the degradation also interfered with higher-level orthographic and lexical
processes. Hermena et al. (2016) reported tentative evidence that skipping is insensitive to subtle
diacritical marks of the upcoming word in reading Arabic, while the same diacritics resulted in
clear preview benefits when the words were later fixated. This finding suggests that the visual
information that is available for saccadic modulation is functionally poorer than that later
extracted via presaccadic attention. However, skipping rates are generally low in Arabic and also
insensitive to parafoveal word frequency, making this complex orthography not an ideal testbed
for studying skipping (Hermena et al., 2018).
1.5. The present study
To study whether word skipping is better explained either by the discrete or the dynamic
control view or perhaps by the vision gradient, series of gaze-contingent sentence reading
experiments with invisible boundary manipulation were run. Skipping was maximized by
presenting spatially narrow 3-5 letter (yet unpredictable) target words (Hautala et al., 2011;
Hautala & Loberg, 2015; Hermena et al., 2017) surrounded by substantially longer words. This
configuration enable testing whether there is a bimodal landing position across word n+1 and n+2,
as predicted by the discrete control, but not by the dynamic adjustment account.
To study which type of parafoveal word information govern the modulation of saccade
length leading to word skipping, target words in sentences were previewed either as identical,
nonwords or containing subtle visual extra dots located either beginning or end of the item. Here
the dynamic and discrete control views differ how they assume information affecting saccades:
According to discrete control view, anomalous previews reduce the latter peak of the bimodal
landing position distribution. On the basis of previous empirical results, dynamic adjustment
should result in leftward shift of the unimodal landing position distribution due to anomalous
previews.
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
Concerning the involvement of attentional mechanisms in skipping, following alternative
hypotheses could be stated: If the preview information utilized in saccade length computation is
predominantly constrained by the vision gradient, the visual dot located in the beginning part of a
word should have a stronger influence on saccade length compared to one in the end part.
However, if the early perception of candidate words for skipping is already enhanced by attention,
the location of the visual anomaly should not have any effect (Gagl et al., 2014).
Finally, the dynamics of saccade control was studied in a post-hoc analysis. According to
the discrete control, the attentional processing of the next word or decision to skip it should be
reflected in previous fixation duration especially at short launch distances, because the processing
of next word has more likely proceeded to the level of affecting saccade target selection (Reichle
& Drieghe, 2013; Schad & Engbert, 2012). If no such interactions are observed, preview exerts an
independent influence on saccadic programming, presumably via parallel attention gradient (e.g.
Snell et al., 2019). This issue is studied in a post-hoc manner for collapsed data across
experiments.

2.1. Simulations.
Because current simulations served to confirm highly expected model predictions, the
simulation results were exceptionally reported already in the Introduction. In all of the
simulations, the standard Monte-Carlo scheme with 1000 runs was adopted, as used in previous
simulation studies of EZ Reader. Specifics of the simulations are being reported elsewhere

required for computing landing positions across two-word sequences reported in Figures 2 and 3.
Default parameter values, with no simulation of interword regressions, was applied. The first and
last word of each sentence were excluded. Processing and plotting of the simulated data were
conducted in the SPSS program. First, the fixation sequence data of all 1000 simulation runs was
merged with a corpus key file (containing complete word sequence for all runs), enabling mapping
of saccade length and resulting landing position in relation to current, next and its subsequent
word. Details of plotting are reported in the notes of the Figures 2 and 3, as well as the statistical
test result for bimodality (see also section 2.7.2. Analysis Method).
2.2. Sentence-Reading Experiments 1–3
This research was conducted in three separate experiments with different participants.
Regarding the differences between the experiments, only parafoveal preview types and their
conditions (each consisting of 24 target words): 1) In the intact condition, previews were the
original words. 2) In the nonword condition, the preview included a nonword formed by replacing
a single letter of the target word. 3) In the dot_begin condition, the preview target word contained
a four-pixel added dot located in the beginning part of the word. 4) In the dot_end condition, the
preview target word contained a four-pixel added dot located in the latter part of the word. As will
be shown, only the nonwords, and not the visual dots, affected the eye movement measurements in
Experiment 1, suggesting that the dots were too small to be detected. Therefore, the size of the
dots was slightly increased for Experiment 2 (see the Stimuli section), resulting in a decrease in
the overall skipping rate and the disappearance of all of the effects between the normal and
anomalous preview conditions observed in Experiment 1. The most obvious explanation is that
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
when 75% of the trials had detectable anomalies, readers adopted a more cautious reading
strategy. Therefore, for Experiment 3, we balanced the number of intact (48) and anomalous
previews (24 dot_begin, 24 dot_end) by replacing the nonword previews in Experiment 2 with
intact previews, resulting in the following preview conditions: 1) intact, 2) large dot_begin, and 3)

to be premature, as the fast-started stallion suddenly lost its position.”
2.3. Participants
There were 20 native Finnish-speaking participants in each of the three experiments,
recruited via student organization mailing lists. The invitation criteria were uncorrected near
for each experiment. The work was conducted in accordance with the APA ethical standards in the
treatment of their sample, human or animal, or to describe the details of treatment, World Medical
Association Declaration of Helsinki, and the research was approved by the Ethical Committee of
the University of Jyväskylä. The participants signed an informed consent form prior to the study,
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
and they received a movie ticket as a reward for their participation. One participant in each
experiment became aware of the preview manipulations.

Ninety-six spatially narrow nominative target words (e.g., ilo [joy] and tiili [brick]),
containing three to five letters each, were embedded into experimental sentence frames. Nonword
previews were constructed by replacing a single letter of a target word with a visually resembling
letter of equal width (e.g., k-h, i-l, n-u, s-o, a-ä) in letter positions 1–3, with the mean position
being 1.7. The dot manipulations were drawn manually with image processing software. In the
context of a narrow exterior letter, the dot was embedded into a letter space, and in the context of a
wide exterior letter, such as a, o, u, or n, the dot was embedded inside of the letter. For

To prevent fatigue, the number of sentences was kept low (48), and every stimulus

sentences were designed so that the target word could not be predicted from the earlier sentence

sample of six people. To reduce the skipping of surrounding words, the preceding and following
words were considerably longer than the target words. Comprehension statements requiring yes-

readers in thorough reading, the statements focused on the meaning of the target words within a
sentence. The difficulty is clearly reflected in the low response accuracy. For example, this
sentence with the bolded target words—“According to recent studies, lice spread the plague to
humans, starting an unfortunate verse in the history of humankind”—was accompanied by this
statement—“The sentence mentioned an insect”—for which with the average accuracy of the
responses was 73%.
2.5. Apparatus
The EyeLink 1000 with tabletop mount (SR Research Ltd. Canada) was used to measure
participants’ eye movements. The stimuli were shown on an LCD screen (Asus VG-236, 1920 x
1080, 120 Hz, 52 x 29 cm) with a 61 cm viewing distance (one pixel corresponding to 0.2646 mm
and 0.02485 visual degrees horizontally). Horizontal eye movements were recorded with a
sampling rate of 2000 Hz, and participants’ heads were stabilized with chin and forehead rests.
Default three-point horizontal calibration covering the entire screen width was conducted prior to
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
each experiment, with a mean calibration error of 0.14 degrees. The calibration points were
presented on the same single line as the experimental sentences.
2.6. Procedure
Eye dominance was determined by the distance hole-in-the-paper test (see Rice et al.,
2008), and only the dominant eye was tracked. There were no effects of the tracked eye on the
landing position on the target words over the course of the three experiments. Participants whose
right eye was tracked launched their saccade toward the target word an average of four pixels
farther than the participants whose left eye was tracked. The tracked eye had no interaction with
the experimental conditions. Text was shown centered on the screen with proportional Arial 16
point font. The horizontal width of one letter was by average 3.1 millimeters, which corresponds
to 0.291 visual degrees and 11.7 pixels at the middle of the screen. The width of a word space was
3 mm. Although some sentences covered almost the entire screen width, the target words were
always located within the central 30 degrees of the screen.
To prevent sentence and word properties from producing effects between the four
experimental conditions, each target word received every type of parafoveal preview according to
a Latin-square rotation of the preview conditions, with the restriction that the same type of
preview was not presented for both the first and the second target word in a sentence. In
Experiment 3, the nonword conditions in all of the 20 rotations were replaced with intact
conditions. Thus, each participant in an experiment received a unique assignment of preview
conditions for target words. Two practice trials were presented at the beginning of the experiment,
with one of them followed by a comprehension statement. To see a stimulus sentence, participants
fixated a circle appearing on the left side of the screen. The fixation was validated by the
experimenter by a key press. If the validation was not successful, a recalibration was conducted.
One reviewer remarked that the high calibration accuracy may have been compromised to
some extent by the usage of lengthy sentences and not employing a 3-point validation before
each trial.

After reading the sentence, participants pressed the left mouse button to continue on to the next
sentence or to receive a comprehension statement. The participant and the experimenter were
situated in separate rooms.
2.7. Eye-movement data processing.
Fixation and saccade data were exported by SR Data Viewer software with a default
saccade detection threshold of 30 deg/s. The functioning of the boundary triggers was inspected
using the fixation and saccade data. The technical performance of the triggers was acceptable,
with an average synchronization delay for screen changes of 6.08 ms, with a 2.3 ms standard
deviation. There were only four occurrences with > 10 ms delays in a sample of 10 datasets.
Across the three experiments, out of 5,760 target words presented, there were 5,357 first-
pass fixation progressions from T-1 to T or T+1 word. From this data pool, cases with premature
trigger firings (1,114) were removed from the analyses of previous fixation duration, first-pass
skipping, saccade length, and landing position. These early fires were presumably caused by the
maximum sampling rate of 2000 Hz, which we selected to minimize the screen synchronization
delay, plus unavoidable hooks (Bahill et al., 1975) and blinks causing momentary deviations in the
gaze-position signal. Unfortunately, one target word had erroneous invisible boundary coordinates
that always led to premature trigger firing and, thus, the exclusion of this item from the analysis.
Luckily, this did not have an effect on the results because the influence of target word identity was
controlled by a Latin-square protocol and statistically by a random factor for items. In addition,
trigger firing prior to 20 ms of saccade onset was accepted, as changes in visual stimuli after this
are unable to cancel the saccadic plan (Buonocore et al., 2015). These early trigger firings
occurred equally across different preview types (𝜒 = 4.8, p = .186). In addition, for the foveal
processing measures (total skipping probability, next fixation duration, and probability of
additional fixation), cases (129) of late trigger firing after the beginning of the next fixation were
removed
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
2.7.1. Independent and dependent measures.
For all of the measures, only cases including a first-pass progression from T-1 to T or to
T+1 were included in the analyses. First-pass skip is a case when a previous fixation was located
at T-1 and the next fixation was located at T+1, prior to the fixating of later words in the sentence.
Total skip is a case when a target word was not fixated at all. Previous fixation duration is the
duration of a fixation located at T-1 immediately preceding a first-pass skip or a fixation landing
on the target word. Launch distance is the difference (in pixels) between the previous fixation
position and the beginning of a word space preceding the target word, which was also the location
of the invisible boundary. Saccade length is the difference between the preceding and subsequent
fixations in angular degrees. In the relative landing position to the target word, values below 1
corresponded to T, and values above 1 to T+1, indicating how far beyond the target word the
skipping saccade landed. Next fixation duration is the duration of the first fixation on T or T+1.
This measure of preview benefit was selected instead of a more commonly used first fixation
duration on T, for which high skipping rate lead to low number of observations. Additional
fixation on the target word is a combined measure of a refixation on the target word and an
immediate regression to the target word after skipping. This measure was used because separate
analyses of post-skipping refixation and regression measures would have suffered from reduced
power in relation to the skipping probability analyses.
2.7.2. Analysis Method
Eye-movement measures related to the target and the preceding words were analyzed by
generalized linear mixed modeling (GLMM) in R using lme4 version 1.1-21 (Bates et al., 2011).
Estimated marginal means, pairwise comparisons, and plots were produced by the emmeans-
package (Lenth, 2018). Logarithmic transformations were used for gamma-distributed fixation
5 In Experiment 2 where 70% of target words were fixated, there was an expected trend of longer first fixation
duration on target word after nonword (222 ms) vs. intact (213 ms) preview, t = 1.23, p = 0.22.

duration and landing position measures , but not for saccade length measure, which was normally
distributed. Experiment-specific analyses were run with one fixed predictor of condition
(dot_begin, dot_end, intact, nonword) and two random intercepts for the participant and the item
(models with random slopes did not converge). Significant main effects for analysis of variances
are followed by pairwise comparisons with Tukey p-value adjustment. Beta estimates are given
for the analyses of continuous dependent variables and odds ratios for the analyses of dichotomous
variables. An odds ratio is a more intuitive index of effect size, indicating how much more
probable an event is in one condition relative to another condition. In the relative landing position
analysis of data collapsed across experiments, convergence was obtained for a model with
uncorrelated participant and item random slopes, which was achieved using the Afex package
(Singmann et al., 2018) for the two-level intact mask factor. Finally, the Hartigan’s dip test for
unimodality (Hartigan, 1985) was run for the overall landing position distribution, using the
diptest R-package (Mächler, 2013).
6 The pattern of significant results was not affected by the logarithmic transformation.

3.1. Experiment 1—Small Visual Dots, Intact and Nonword Preview Conditions
After the removal of failed trigger firings, there were 1,486 observations (77.4 % of
possible) available for analysis for preview measures (74.3 observations per participant) and 1,456
(75.8%) observations for foveal processing measures.
3.1.1. Saccade length.
The main effect of condition, 𝜒 (3) = 10.26 , p = 0.002, was significant, which was the
result of a significant contrast between the nonword (M = 2.41 deg) and the dot_begin (M = 2.58
deg) conditions (𝛽 = 0.17, SE = 0.05, z = 3.18, p = .008). Random effects variances were 0.048
(0.22) for the participant and 0.11 (0.33) for the item.
3.1.2. First-pass skipping probability.
The main effect of condition, 𝜒 (3) = 8.15 , p = .043, resulted from the significant contrast
between the dot_end (M = 46%) and the nonword (M = 35%) conditions (odds ratio [OR] = 1.58,
SE = 0.27, z = 2.73, p = 0.032). Random effects variances were 0.83 (0.91) for the participant and
0.39 (0.63) for the item.
3.1.3. Total skipping probability.
Main effect of condition, 𝜒 (3) = 17.6, p < .001, resulted from the significant contrasts
between the dot_begin (M = 26%) and the nonword (M = 15%) conditions (OR = 2.01, SE = 0.38,
z = 3.26, p = .001), the dot_end (M = 25%) and the nonword conditions (OR = 1.94, SE = 0.37, z =
3.45, p = .003), and the intact (M = 26%) and the nonword conditions (OR = 1.99, SE = 0.38 z =
3.57, p = .002). Random effects variances were 0.71 (0.84) for the participant and 0.45 (0.67) for
the item.
3.1.4. Fixation duration and additional fixation measures.
There were no differences between conditions for previous fixation duration, 𝜒 (3) = 1.53,
p = .68, or for next fixation duration, 𝜒 (3) = 2.77, p = .43. For the probability of additional
fixation measure, there was a main effect of preview condition, 𝜒 (3) = 10.8, p = .013, resulting

from the significant contrasts between the intact (M = 6%) and the nonword (M = 12%) conditions
(OR = 0.48, SE = 0.13, z = -2.72, p = .033) and the dot_begin (M = 6%) and the nonword
conditions (OR = 0.48, SE = 0.13, z = -2.69, p = .036).
3.1.5. Summary.
By selecting spatially narrow yet unpredictable target words, we were able to induce a
high first-pass skipping rate of over 40% and a total skipping probability of 25%. Consistently
with previous findings (e.g. Gagl et al., 2014), the nonword preview condition led to shorter
saccade length and reduced first-pass skipping probability. The size of the nonword preview effect
on saccade length was very small, already supporting the dynamic adjustment rather than the
discrete control account. As expected, the nonword preview was followed by an increase in the
probability of immediate or delayed additional fixation of the target words, indicating disturbed
lexical preprocessing. Visual dot preview conditions had no effect on saccadic measures relative
to intact condition, suggesting that our visual dots were too small to be perceived during the
preview. Therefore, we increased the size of the visual dots for the second experiment.
3.2. Experiment 2—Larger Visual Dots, Intact and Nonword Preview Conditions
After the removal of failed trigger firings, there were 1,408 observations (73.3%) available
for the analysis of the preview measures (70.4 observations per participant) and 1,380
observations (71.8%) for the foveal processing measures.
3.2.1. Saccade length.
The main effect of condition was not significant, 𝜒 (3) = 6.48 , p = 0.09, nor were planned
contrasts. The random effects variances were 0.07 (0.26) for the participant and 0.08 (0.28) for the
item.
3.2.2. First-pass skipping probability.
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
There was no main effect of condition, 𝜒 (3) = 2.96 , p = 0.39. The random effects
variances were 0.89 (0.94) for the participant and 0.36 (0.60) for the item.
3.2.3. Total skipping probability.
There was no main effect of condition, 𝜒 (3) = 1.40, p = .71. The random effects variances
were 1.04 (1.01) for the participant and 0.54 (0.74) for the item.
3.2.4. Fixation duration and additional fixation measures.
There were no differences between conditions for previous fixation duration, 𝜒 (3) = 0.52,
p = .92, next fixation duration, 𝜒 (3) = 2.17, p = .53, or the probability of additional fixation
measure, 𝜒 (3) = 5.64, p = .13.
3.2.5. Summary.
Increasing the size of the dots abolished all the nonword preview-related effects observed
in Experiment 1. The most obvious explanation is that skipping had become a less useful reading
strategy when 75% of the trials had effective anomalies. This conclusion was further supported by
a significant difference in total skipping probability (z = -2.17, p = 0.03) between Experiment 1 (M
= 25.5%, SE = 4%) and Experiment 2 (M = 15.1%, SE = 3%). To study the hypothesis that large
visual dots affect skipping when the probability of intact and manipulated previews are balanced,
we replaced the nonword previews with intact previews in Experiment 3.
3.3. Experiment 3—Larger Visual Dots and Intact Preview Conditions
After the removal of failed trigger firings, there were 1,349 observations (70.2%) available
for the analysis of preview measures (67.5 observations per participant) and 1,304 (67.9%)
observations for the foveal processing measures. All of the intact trials, whose number was now
doubled, were included in the analyses.
3.3.1. Saccade length.
The main effect of condition, 𝜒 (2) = 12.07 , p = 0.002, resulted from significant contrasts
between intact (M = 2.47 deg) and dot_begin (M = 2.33 deg) conditions (𝛽 = 0.15, SE = 0.05, z =

3.19, p = .004), and intact and dot_end (M = 2.36 deg) conditions (𝛽 = 0.11, SE = 0.05, z = 2.33, p
= .005). Random effects variances were 0.24 (0.49) for the participant and 0.08 (0.28) for the item.
3.3.2. First-pass skipping probability.
The main effect of condition, 𝜒 (2) = 8.81, p = 0.01, resulted from significant contrast
between the intact (M = 41%) and dot_begin (M = 31%) conditions (OR = 1.50, SE = 0.24, z =
2.61, p = .025) and from nearly significant intact and dot_end (M = 33%) conditions (OR = 1.41,
SE = 0.22, z = 2.19, p = 0.07). Random effects variances were 1.40 (1.18) for the participant and
0.29 (0.54) for the item.
3.3.3. Total skipping probability.
The main effect of condition approached significance, 𝜒 (3) = 4.89, p = .087, with non-
significant contrasts between the intact and dot_begin conditions (OR = 1.42, SE = .25, z = 2.02, p
= 0.11) as well as between the intact and dot_end conditions (OR = 1.30, SE = 0.23, z = 1.50, p =
.29). The random effects variances were 1.35 (1.16) for the participant and 0.22 (0.47) for the
item.
3.3.4. Fixation duration and additional fixation measures.
There were no differences between the conditions for previous fixation duration, 𝜒 (3) =
0.95, p = .95, next fixation duration, 𝜒 (3) = 2.17, p = .34, or probability of additional fixation,
𝜒 (3) = 1.27, p = .53.
3.3.5. Summary.
The target words, now shown with enlarged visual dot previews, were less likely to be
skipped (41% to 31%), and saccade lengths were shorter than with intact previews. The
magnitudes of these effects were comparable to what was observed in Experiment 1. This
interpretation was supported by a nonsignificant interaction (z = -0.19, p = 0.98) between
experiments (1, 3) and disruptive preview (Exp 1: nonword, other conditions, Exp 3: intact vs.
large dot conditions). However, unlike what was found for nonword previews in Experiment 1,
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
large visual dot previews in Experiment 3 were associated with neither increased additional
fixation probability nor lower total skipping probability relative to intact preview. This result is in
line with the previous knowledge of subtle visual manipulations affecting only early word
recognition processes, but do not interfere with later lexical processing (Glaholt et al., 2014;
Reingold & Rayner, 2006; White & Staub, 2012; Gagl et al., 2014). Again, there were no
indications that the location of the dot had any influence on skipping. Thus, it can be concluded
that the visual processing of an upcoming short word before skipping is holistic in nature rather
than being strongly governed by degrading visual quality toward larger eccentricity.
3.4. Analysis of Saccadic Control Underlying Word Skipping
Experiment-specific analyses indicated that only nonword and large dot previews were
effective in affecting saccade lengths and, thus, skipping. To gain more statistical power for
studying interactions between factors potentially affecting saccade targeting, data from
experiments 1 and 3 were pooled together. Because there were no significant effects of preview
type in experiment 2, its data was excluded from this analysis. Then, the disruptive preview types
(nonword in Experiments 1, large dot previews in Experiment 3) were collapsed together and
compared with ineffective preview types (intact and dot previews in Experiments 1, intact in
Experiment 3).
Relative landing position in the scale of target word T was calculated for each fixation
preceded by a first-pass saccade crossing the invisible boundary. The landing position was
predicted full-factorially with preview (intact, anomalous), launch distance, and previous fixation
duration, while random structure included intercepts and slopes for preview type, both for the
participants and items. Landing position, previous fixation duration, and launch distance values
larger than three SD from the mean were excluded. According to the results, landing position
shifts left as a function of increasing launch distance (𝛽 = -0.43, SE = 0.03, t = -13.4, p < .001), as
well as after the presentation of an anomalous preview (𝛽 = 0.15, SE = 0.04, t = 3.34, p = .002).

4. Discussion
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
Word skipping has been widely considered as a central phenomenon for the theoretical
understanding of eye-movement control in reading (Reichle & Drieghe, 2013). To explain
linguistic level effects on word skipping, prevalent models have relied on the discrete control
assumption, i.e. the selection of a saccade target word on the basis of parafoveal lexical processing
(Engbert et al., 2005; Reichle et al., 1999; Reilly & Radach, 2006; Snell et al., 2018b). In contrast,
according to the dynamic adjustment views (Cutter et al., 2017, 2018; Liu et al., 2017a–b),
saccade length is computed in a continuous manner as a function of current and next word
properties. Here, it was shown by simulations that a prominent discrete control model, EZ Reader,
predict bimodal landing position across a candidate word for skipping and its subsequent word,
and that linguistic properties of the candidate word affect which one of these words will become
the saccade target. Instead, a dynamic adjustment model (CBSL) predicted unimodal landing
position distribution, and previous empirical results provided basis to predict small continuous
influence of upcoming word on landing position. Finally, the general prediction of attentional
involvement in skipping was studied by testing whether the vision gradient over candidate words
for skipping is subject of early attentional enhancement capable to affect saccade planning. These
predictions were studied in three boundary experiments, in which likely-to-be skipped short target
words were shown with varying previews, being either intact, nonword neighbors to target words,
or containing an extra visual dot located either in the beginning part or end part of the word. As
will be discussed, the results generally favored the dynamic adjustment view over the discrete
control explanation.
4.2. Dynamic or Discrete control of Saccades?
Consistent with the CBSL, but not with the EZ Reader prediction, a unimodal landing
position distribution was found across target and its subsequent word. This result is in line with
previous empirical findings studying landing positions across word spaces (Albrengues et al.,
2019) and the well-known property of landing position distributions being truncated at word
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
boundaries (since McConkie et al., 1988, 1989). Neither other signs of discrete control (Engbert et
al., 2005; Reichle et al., 2017; Reilly & Radach, 2006; Snell et al., 2018b) were observed: The
anomalous previews did not reduce the probability to select word n+2 as a saccade target, and the
preview effects were not conditional on near launch distance or long previous fixation duration
(Eskenazi & Folk, 2015; Rayner et al., 2011; White, 2007). Note that the serial EZ Reader model
(Reichle et al., 1999) predict inflated fixation durations prior skipping due to saccadic
preplanning, whereas parallel attention models predict that processing of next word may affect
fixation duration prior skipping (Engbert et al., 2005; Reilly & Radach, 2006; Snell et al., 2018b).
Instead, the present results favor the view that the parafoveal perception induce a time-
independent influence on saccade lengths (Schotter et al., 2012; Brothers et al., 2017). However,
this aspect of our result should be taken with caution due to reliance of post-hoc data selection
procedure of effective and non-effective preview conditions. Taken together, the present results
provide support that dynamic adjustment of saccade length is a potent mechanism to explain also
word skipping in reading, previously thought to require discrete selection of a target word. In other
words, skipping saccades seem not to be categorically different from other progressive saccades.
4.1. The Nature of Parafoveal Preprocessing in Reading.
The possible involvement of attention in saccade length modulation was studied by
comparing the effect of location of the visual dot within the preview of the target word; an early
attentional mechanism should compensate the degrading vision gradient towards larger
eccentricity so that location of the visual dot should not have an effect (see Snell et al., 2019). This
hypothesis was clearly confirmed by the results, suggesting that the parafoveal vision is subject to
attentional enhancement early enough to affect saccade programming (Inhoff & Radach, 2014;
Inhoff et al., 2005; Snell et al., 2018a).
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
To study which type of parafoveal information is used in saccade length modulation
governing skipping, the effects of subtle nonword vs. visual dot previews was compared. Both
discrete and dynamics control views predicted that skipping is affected by both types of previews,
yet with different targeting mechanism: Dynamic adjustment would lead leftward shift in landing
position for anomalous previews, whereas EZ Reader predict reduced probability to target word
n+2. The results confirmed equal small effect of preview types on saccade length modulation
(Choi & Gordon, 2014; Gordon et al., 2013; Plummer & Rayner, 2012; Drieghe, 2008;
Warrington et al., 2018). After the already discovered unimodal landing position distribution, it
was not surprise that the anomalous previews affected saccade length through the dynamic
adjustment mechanism. However, the visual anomalies had to be of sufficient size for being able
to affect saccadic length, which seems to parallel Hermena et al. (2018) finding no skipping
effects for the absence of small diacritic marks in the reading of Arabic. Together, the available
evidence suggests that any detectable information in blurred parafoveal vision is used to guide
saccades in reading. Tentatively, according to predictive coding framework (for a review, see
Huang & Rao, 2011), a preview may first induce a visual-orthographic prediction, which need to
be yet confirmed on the basis of more acuity vision (Friston et al., 2012). Any detected oddity in
preview may intervene the prediction generation and reduce the saccade length to some extent.
Instead, highly familiar preview induces fast and reliable predictions, and lower quality visual
sample may be sufficient to confirm their accuracy.
4.1. The Cognitive Mechanism Underlying Word Skipping in Reading.
Combining the present findings with the previous knowledge of the importance of spatial
width of current (Cutter et al., 2017; 2018) and next word (Hautala et al., 2011; Hautala & Loberg,
2015; Hermena et al., 2017) on saccadic measures, a following dynamic adjustment mechanism
for skipping can be drafted: First, as explicated by the CBSL account (Cutter et al., 2017, 2018;
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
Anonymous, preprint), the preliminary saccade length is extracted through preview of distance
between center of words n+1 and n+2. Then, this preliminary program is corrected to some extent
by the actual launch distance from word n+1 to word n+2. The results of the present study then
add to this knowledge by showing that the saccade length if also fine-tuned by the preview
processing of the next word. This preview processing seems to be enhanced by parallel attention
gradient, instead of being fully determined by vision gradient (Gagl et al., 2014). If this preview
processing does not encounter anything highly anomalous content (Reingold et al., 2016), its
influence on saccade length is rather small, yet sufficient to produce the small visual and linguistic
level effects on word skipping. Together these mechanisms produce uniform landing position
distribution across words n+1 and n+2.
Previous studies have compared and modelled landing positions of skipping and non-
skipping cases (Krügel et al., 2010; Krügel et al., 2014). Such a comparison is based on discrete
control assumption, but from the the perspective of dynamic adjustment it would mean comparing
beginning of a distribution with its tail. Nevertheless, skipping saccades are special for the reason
that two word spaces are crossed, which reduce saccade length (Krügel et al., 2010) and increase
oculomotor error (Krügel & Engbert, 2014). At least the former effect is fully in line with the
1).
4.3. Preview Effects on Later Foveal Processing.
After fixing the saccadic program, the processing of a parafoveal word continues, and its
visual perception is further enhanced by the presaccadic attention mechanism (Li et al., 2016;
Rolfs & Carrasco, 2012). In line with previous studies utilizing faint font manipulation (Glaholt et
al., 2014; Reingold & Rayner, 2006; Warrington et al., 2018; White & Staub, 2012), but in
contrast to partial visual degradation manipulations (Gagl et al., 2014), our subtle visual dot
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
preview was not associated with foveal processing difficulties. Thus, the task-irrelevant visual
dots affected only early level of lexical processing of words, which was overcome rapidly during
later foveal processing (Warrington et al., 2018).
As expected, orthographically illegal previews led to later foveal processing difficulties,
which has been observed in several previous studies (Choi & Gordon, 2014; Gordon et al., 2013;
Hohenstein & Kliegl, 2014; Schotter et al., 2018, 2019; Plummer & Rayner, 2012; Reingold &
Rayner, 2006). Surprisingly, the effect of nonword preview did not yet manifest in the next
fixation duration (on T or including also T+1 word), but appeared first in the increased probability
to make an immediate additional fixation and in later regressions to the target word. A
contributing factor here was the use of visually similar replacement letters, which are known

).
present study was not optimized for studying foveal effects due to high skipping rate, which
reduced the number of first-pass fixations. In line with this explanation, there was a trend towards
expected direction in the first fixation duration of target words in experiment 2, where the
skipping rate was lowest.
4.4. Limitations.
It is possible that the discrete control disputed herein depends largely on the distinctiveness
of preview objects controlling the speed and the certainty of parafoveal perception. Supporting
evidence for this view is provided by Reingold and colleagues (2016), who showed that symbol
strings unrelated to the text are highly likely to be skipped during reading. Thus, the caveat with
visual manipulations is that in some circumstances, they may become saccade targets (or non-
targets) themselves. We did not find such an effect; yet, in Experiment 2, there was a trend toward
longer saccade lengths when the anomalous dot was in the end rather than in the beginning part of
a word. Given that the nonword effect was also absent from Experiment 2, it is possible that when
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
almost every sentence contains something weird, readers start to invest their attentional resources
in detecting these anomalies by trying to fixate every word (see Wotschack, & Kliegl, 2013, for
the strategic control of skipping). Thus, it is recommended that the number of intact and visually
anomalous trials should be balanced in this type of research.
Importantly, the present findings may be rather specific to short words and therefore likely
to represent skipping driven by the visuo-oculomotor mechanism. Instead, the skipping of longer
words is likely to be driven more by higher-level cognitive processes, perhaps by a genuine
discrete control mechanism taking place in rare occasions. In fact, there is evidence that word
predictability has an equal influence on word skipping in short and long words (Rayner et al.,
2011), meaning that the effect is relatively greater in long than short words. Moreover, readers can
also strategically adjust their reading, e.g., by skimming parts of a text or skipping redundant
words or entire parts of sentences.
Methodological particularities of the present study include insertion of two target words
into a single sentence, which lead to long carrier sentences. Despite of high calibration accuracy
values, the long sentences may have induced some extra head movements. The comprehension
questions tried to guide attention towards target words, being therefore often concerned on minor
details. Consequently, few participants scored low in these questions, making it somewhat unsure
if they were fully engaged with reading all of the time. However, their data was kept in the
analyses because exclusion of any participant would had produced a bias in the latin-square
rotation of conditions.
4.5. Conclusions.
The present findings provide clear support for the dynamic adjustment view of saccade
length also in word-spaced orthographies (Cutter et al., 2017, 2018; Anonymous, Preprint), as
previously studied in non-spaced orthography (Liu et al., 2017a–b, 2018). The dynamic center-
RUNNING HEAD: A dynamic adjustment account of word skipping
based saccade length model (Cutter et al., 2017, 2018; Anonymous, Preprint) supplemented with
empirical knowledge, was found to provide a highly tenable and parsimonious account of eye
movement control underlying word skipping. Boundary manipulations provided also novel
evidence that attentional enhancement of vision over short next word takes place early enough to
affect fine-tuning of saccadic length. It can be concluded that dynamic adjustment control
provides a viable alternative to discrete control family of models, which assume that saccade
target word selection is driven by lexical processes.
