Abstract
Checking behavior is a natural and adaptive strategy for resolving uncertainty in
everyday situations. Here, we aimed at investigating the psychological drivers of
checking and its regulation by uncertainty, in non-clinical participants and controlled
experimental settings. We found that the sensitivity of participants’ explicit confidence
judgments to actual performance (explicit metacognition) predicted the extent to which
their checking strategy was regulated by uncertainty. Yet, a more implicit measure of
metacognition (derived from asking participants to opt between trials) did not contribute
to the regulation of checking behavior. Meanwhile, how participants scaled on
questionnaires eliciting self-beliefs such as self-confidence and self-reported
obsessive-compulsive symptoms also predicted participants’ uncertainty-guided
checking tendencies. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that checking behavior is
likely the outcome of a core explicit metacognitive process operating at the scale of
single decisions, while remaining influenced by general self-beliefs. Our findings are
thus consistent with two mechanisms (micro vs. macro) through which this otherwise
adaptive behavior could go awry in certain psychiatric disorders such as obsessive-
compulsive disorder.

Introduction
Everyday decisions are often marred by uncertainty 1. Gathering new evidence through
exploration is a useful and rational strategy to reduce the impact of uncertainty on
subsequent decisions 2. One of such exploratory strategies is checking, a procedure
through which an agent repeatedly samples from the same source of information 3,4.
In a changing environment, checking can serve the useful purpose to update one’s,
possibly outdated, internal model about the world 5; for instance, checking one’s
smartphone for possible novel notifications. In spite of its apparent simplicity, what
drives checking in humans, and how it is regulated by observer’s uncertainty about the
world, remains mostly unknown.
Deciphering the psychological drivers of checking is also key to understand how this,
otherwise rational, behavior goes awry in certain pathological conditions such as
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). About 80% of OCD patients 6,7 indeed exhibit
excessive checking; not only for anxiety-related, but also neutral, stimuli 8–11. In line
with the hypothesized uncertainty-reducing role of checking, patients typically report
that checking reduces their uncertainty about checked options 12.
One hypothesis we explored here is thus that checking behavior depends on an
uncertainty-evaluation, or metacognitive, process 13–17. Traditional models have
decomposed metacognitive processes into two categories: (i) explicit metacognition,
understood as, at least partially, conscious evaluations and regulations of our own
decisions, grounded in reflective processes involving introspection, and which enables
humans to share metacognitive representations with other people 18–21; and (ii) implicit
metacognition understood as pre-reflective, automatic evaluations and regulations of
our own decisions, which does not necessarily reach awareness 18,22, and which are
present in non-verbal young infant 23 and non-human animals 24. In explicit
metacognition tasks, subjects are often asked to rate their confidence into some past
decision 20. By contrast, in implicit metacognition tasks, subjects do not explicitly rate
their confidence but, instead, use it to guide decision-making, such as when choosing
between several options from which to get rewarded 25. In line with this taxonomy,
here, we contrasted the contributions of both explicit and implicit metacognitive
monitoring sensitivities to uncertainty-guided checking behavior, and explored the
possibility that checking might only be related to explicit metacognition.
The propensity to check exhibits a wide spectrum from occasional to excessive forms
even in the non-clinical population 26. Previous studies provide converging evidence
that self-beliefs (e.g. cognitive distrust) correlate with a general tendency to check, as
assessed by questionnaires, in healthy subjects 27,28. The mechanisms underlying this
association are however still unknown. We further hypothesized that self-beliefs such
as the self-reported overall propensity to compulsion and cognitive distrust, which
varies across individuals, also in the non-clinical population, would impede uncertainty-
guided checking behavior.
To address these questions, we capitalized on previous attempts to reproduce
checking behavior in controlled experimental settings 3,4,8–10,29. Notably, we leveraged
cutting-edge experimental psychology paradigms allowing us to manipulate perceptual
uncertainty through stimulus difficulty similarly across individuals, independently of
overall performance. We then quantified the number of checks for different levels of
perceptual uncertainty, and assessed to what extent they related to performance. We
also measured the sensitivity of participants’ implicit and explicit metacognition using
state-of-the-art measures 30,31. Finally, we made the bridge with widely used clinical
2/18
notions by relying on validated questionnaires to assess inter-individual differences in
declarative self-beliefs.
We made the following hypotheses: (H ) we predicted that checking reduces
participants' uncertainty about checked options; (H ) accordingly, we expected that
checking allows individuals to increase task performance: performance should be
better after checking than after immediate decisions; (H ) importantly, we predicted
that checking behavior depends on an explicit uncertainty-evaluation (explicit
metacognitive accuracy) rather than an implicit uncertainty-evaluation (implicit
metacognitive accuracy) process; (H ) finally, we expected that, above and beyond
inter-individual differences in metacognitive sensitivities, participants’ self-beliefs, such
as self-reported compulsivity and low self-confidence, would impede checking
behavior even in healthy subjects. In a nutshell, our findings show that uncertainty-
guided checking behavior relates to both participants’ (explicit, but not implicit)
metacognitive sensitivity as well as to self-beliefs.
Results
We report results for a total of 28 human healthy participants who were asked to rate
the orientation (left or right) of random dot motion (RDM) stimuli. Difficulty levels (i.e.
motion coherence) were adjusted at the single participant level thanks to an initial
calibration phase (see Methods), to prevent inter-individual differences in visual
perception to affect the results.
Checking behavior. Participants performed a checking task in which they were
allowed to replay (an infinite number of times) the RDM stimulus before committing to
fluctuations of checking behavior, how checking is regulated by stimulus difficulty and
whether it improves subsequent performance.
Firstly, in order to evaluate the impact of stimulus difficulty on checking (H ), we used
a Poisson mixed effect model explaining trial-by-trial fluctuations in the number of
participants increased their checking frequency for more difficult stimuli (b = 0.90, p <
participants’ uncertainty about future decisions (H ).
a, RDM stimuli. Stimuli used throughout the study were random dot motion (RDM) stimuli whose
coherence level was manipulated. Participants were asked to judge the direction of motion (either
left or right). b, Checking task. Representative trial of the checking task: before committing to

the decision, participants were allowed to replay the RDM stimulus an infinite number of times.
Feedback was delivered at the end of the trial. c, Increased checking after more difficult
stimuli. Number of checks according to motion coherence (i.e. difficulty, in arbitrary units, a.u.),
which is expressed in three terciles for the sake of averaging over participants (who have
different perceptual sensitivity). d, Decreased performance after checking. Accuracy of
orientation judgments as a function of motion coherence and number of checks. Same binning
method as in c. Error bars correspond to standard error of the mean.
Secondly, in order to evaluate whether checking behavior improved subsequent
performance (H ), we used a multivariate logistic mixed-effect model explaining trial-
by-trial fluctuations in RDM task performance (hereafter referred to as ℳ ; see
decreased performance on RDM stimuli of matched difficulty levels (b = –0.26,
checking on performance decreased with stimulus difficulty (number of checks by
stimulus difficulty significant and positive interaction; b = 0.20, p = 6.27 × 10–5):
checking more strongly reduced performance for high motion coherence RDM stimuli
(i.e. easy trials). Although checking was promoted by perceptual uncertainty (H ), it
thus did not appear to reduce the impact of perceptual uncertainty on subsequent
decisions (H ); we later discuss possible reasons for this finding (see Discussion).
Contribution of metacognition to checking. Showing that our experimental settings
induced uncertainty-guided fluctuations in checking behavior, we now turn to one of
our study goals: assessing the contribution of inter-individual differences in
metacognitive sensitivities in the tendency of participants to check (H ). In particular,
we assessed a possible differential effect between implicit and explicit metacognitive
sensitivities in the promotion of checking and its regulation by perceptual uncertainty.
In a well-established explicit metacognition task (see for example 32), participants were
asked to explicitly rate their confidence (on a scale ranging from 1, low confidence, to
participants’ explicit metacognitive sensitivity using M-ratio, a well-established
measure of (explicit) metacognitive sensitivity which quantify the amount of perceptual
information (in signal-to-noise units) that is available to metacognitive processes 33.
Overall, participants had an M-ratio significantly higher than zero (two-tailed one
thereby showing that confidence judgments were predictive of actual performance.
In an implicit metacognition task, using an original design by Barthelmé and
Mamassian 34 and validated in further studies 25,30,34, participants had to judge the
direction of two successive RDMs, of different difficulty levels (i.e. motion coherence),
before being finally asked to indicate the one for which they judged to be more likely
computing the difference in sigmoid slopes (relating stimulus difficulty to performance)
between the discarded and the chosen stimulus (divided by the average slope across
both conditions), hereafter referred to as the confidence modulation index (CMI) 25,30.
Participants’ CMI was significantly higher than zero (two-tailed one sample Wilcoxon

decision-making.

reflect distinct (meta)cognitive processes and, possibly, relate differently to checking
behavior. Accordingly, we also found a dissociation in the contributions of explicit vs.
implicit metacognitive sensitivities to uncertainty-guided checking behavior (H ). On
the one hand, the Poisson mixed effect model explaining trial-by-trial fluctuations in the
number of checks (ℳ ) revealed a significant positive interaction between M-ratio and
driven by perceptual uncertainty more strongly in participants with higher explicit
metacognitive sensitivity. Conversely, the interaction between CMI (i.e. implicit
metacognitive monitoring ability) and stimulus difficulty was negative and non-
differential modulation of implicit vs. explicit metacognitive sensitivities on uncertainty-
guided checking behavior was significant using a likelihood ratio test (LRT) between
the original model (ℳ ) versus a restricted model which assumes the equality between
the regression coefficients of the interactions of interest (i.e. interactions between CMI
and stimulus difficulty, and M-ratio and stimulus difficulty; LRT: chi-square = 5.88, 1 df,
p = 0.015). This analysis thus confirmed that checking is more strongly driven by
perceptual uncertainty in participants with elevated explicit, but not implicit,
metacognitive monitoring ability (H ).

reporting their orientation judgment, participants were asked to report their confidence in this

end of each trial. b, Sensitivity of explicit metacognition. The sensitivity of explicit
metacognition was measured using the M-ratio, which quantifies the amount of decision

measured as the difference in slopes between psychometric functions corresponding to the

Contribution of self-beliefs to checking. We hypothesized that, above and beyond
inter-individual differences in metacognitive sensitivities, participants’ self-beliefs, such
as self-reported compulsivity and self-confidence, would modulate checking behavior
even in our non-clinical population (H ). To investigate this, we asked participants to
answer questionnaires at the end of our experiment.
First, we measured the declarative lack of confidence in various cognitive domains
(e.g. “my memory can mislead me at times”) using the cognitive mistrust subscale of
interest here as a long series of studies (see 27 for a review) consistently showed that
persons suffering from compulsive checking typically exhibit higher levels of cognitive
mistrust. Here, we tested, in particular, the hypothesis that cognitive mistrust may
decrease the sensitivity of checking behavior to perceptual uncertainty. Accordingly,
we found that cognitive mistrust significantly reduced the effect of stimulus difficulty on
checking behavior (ℳ ; cognitive mistrust by stimulus difficulty significant negative
Second, we measured self-reported obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) using the
Padua inventory scale 36 which quantifies self-reported obsessions and rituals across
four dimensions: mental control, checking, contamination obsessions and anxiety
S3), as previously observed 28. We found, however, that, contrary to the cognitive
mistrust subscale, the self-reported obsessive-compulsive symptoms increased the
effect of stimulus difficulty on checking behavior (ℳ ; Padua inventory by stimulus

Discussion
The aim of the present study was to investigate the psychological drivers of checking
behavior in humans, in particular its regulation by environmental uncertainty. Our
results provide evidence that human checking behavior is the outcome of an
uncertainty-evaluation, or metacognitive, process (H ). Indeed, participants increased
their checking frequency for more difficult stimuli, and thus more uncertain settings 38.
This result is in line with past findings in non-human primates 4,39 which demonstrate
that checking adaptively aims at decreasing one’s uncertainty about future decisions.
Contrary to what was expected, checking had a detrimental effect on performance:
accuracy was worse after checking than after immediate decisions (H ). A first possible
explanation of this unexpected result relates to the psychophysical properties of the
RDM stimuli used in this study: although the difficulty of the RDM stimulus was kept
constant across all replays (if any), each replayed RDM differed in the exact spatial
locations of the dots. A possibility is that participants expected to see the exact same
RDMs across all replays. The incongruence of replayed RDMs with subject’s
expectations may have impaired subsequent decision-making processes. To
investigate this hypothesis, future studies could manipulate the extent to which
stimulus replays vary from the original stimulus and compare the impact on
performance. Worth noting, above a given degree of stimulus dissimilarity, it is likely
that the cognitive process at stake will relate more to ‘information sampling’ than
genuine ‘checking behavior’ 11. Further theoretical work is highly needed to devise the
conceptual delineations of those processes. A second, perhaps more interesting,
explanation for the detrimental effect of checking on subsequent performance is that
repeated checking of the RDM stimuli may hinder (perceptual) decision-making
processes. This possibility echoes the results of a recent meta-analysis which revealed
that repeated checking reduced memory accuracy of visual stimuli across experiments,
in addition to the well-known reduction in memory confidence 40. The mechanisms
underlying this reduction in memory performance are not yet known. A possibility is
that, in our study, the diminished perceptual decision-making performance relies on
similar mechanisms. Further studies are necessary to replicate our unexpected result,
and to investigate its possible underpinnings. Importantly, our results show that
although detrimental on average, checking nevertheless remains adaptive in the sense
7/18
that this detrimental effect seems to decrease with stimulus difficulty, thereby
suggesting it is still more adapted to check after more difficult stimuli.
Our study also provides evidence that implicit and explicit metacognitive sensitivities
are dissociable (H ) and that they relate differently to uncertainty-guided checking
behavior. We found that, in the non-clinical population, uncertainty-guided checking
behavior is promoted by a conscious, explicit high-level mental representation 18–20,
rather than by an unconscious, implicit low-level representation of perceptual
uncertainty 18,22. The role of this dichotomy in shaping checking behavior has received
surprisingly little attention despite its important implications for disorders of checking
behavior, including OCD. It has been suggested that excessive checking behavior in
compulsive checkers corresponds to the pathological automatization of an otherwise
deliberate behavior 40–43. One could thus hypothesize that such an automatization
relates to an insufficient contribution of explicit metacognitive processes to uncertainty-
driven checking in compulsive checkers. This insufficient contribution could result from
an alteration of the ability to explicitly introspect about one’s decisions (an alteration of
the so-called metacognitive monitoring ability) as suggested by recent studies 44,45.
Another possibility is that the ability to explicitly introspect about one’s decisions is
preserved, but the resulting information is not appropriately used for the regulation of
checking behavior. To our knowledge such a metacognitive control impairment has
never been investigated in OCD. In either case, compulsive checkers would lack an
explicit, conscious termination cue, and would continue checking regardless of
environmental uncertainty.
Over and above the contribution of core metacognitive processes operating at the
scale of single decisions, our results suggest that uncertainty-guided checking
behavior is also influenced by self-beliefs (H ), including the self-reported propensity
to compulsions and cognitive mistrust. Previous studies provide converging evidence
that self-reported overall confidence in memory is lowered by repetitive checking in
healthy subjects 40 and that OCD patients have lowered confidence in memory, as well
as in other cognitive domains 27. Nonetheless, the mechanism underlying the typical
association between excessive checking and cognitive mistrust is still unknown. Our
results bring a step forward in understanding by showing that cognitive mistrust
impedes the regulation of checking behavior by perceptual uncertainty. It follows that
the alteration of uncertainty-guided checking behavior may mediate the association
between cognitive mistrust and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS), a hypothesis
which remains to be tested.
Conversely, our results show that beyond cognitive mistrust, self-reported OCS are
associated with checking behavior better tuned to environmental uncertainty,
operationalised here as stimulus difficulty. This goes against our hypothesis that the
propensity to compulsion, conceived as a continuum from non-clinical OCS to OCD 26,
would impede uncertainty-guided checking behavior (H ). A possible explanation for
this result is that the relation of compulsivity to uncertainty-driven checking behavior
may depend on whether compulsivity falls within the clinical or non-clinical domain.
The association between compulsivity and the impairment of uncertainty-guided
checking behavior would thus appear clearly only for pathological compulsivity. Future
studies in patients with OCD are necessary in order to test these hypotheses. To that
regard, our well-controlled experimental setting might be relevant in assessing
checking behavior in OCD patients.
Our findings should be relativized given the exploratory nature of our study and its
limitations. In particular, we found two unexpected findings which we call for
8/18
replications: a detrimental effect of checking on performance, and an association
between increased self-reported OCS and improved uncertainty-guided checking
behavior. A classic but major limitation of our study concerns our sample size. Although
we collected a large number of trials to maximize within-subject reliability and
sensitivity of our results, we believe it is important to confirm our results in larger
sample sizes. We also note that given recent evidence reporting an impact of feedback
onto self-reported measures 46, it is possible that feedback provided in the course of
the experiment may have influenced subsequent self-reports, including cognitive
distrust and OCS. However, because performance was individually tailored (to ~70%
accuracy), it is likely that the impact of task feedback onto subjects’ self-beliefs, if any,
was uniform across subjects, and thereby could not by itself explain our results. In
addition, in previous research, implicit metacognition is assessed in different ways and
the ideal behavioural task for its assessment is still debated. Some tasks require
subjects to place bets on their decisions or give subjects the possibility to opt out 47.
However, whether these implicit (non-verbal) uncertainty-monitoring tasks are
metacognitive is a matter of debate 21,48. In the present study, the implicit metacognition
task required subjects to choose among two stimuli the one they judged the most likely
to yield a correct response 25,30,34. As Mamassian and colleagues showed, when doing
so, participants' have to compare two levels of uncertainty related to two successive
decisions 34. This ‘comparison step’ makes the so-called implicit metacognition slightly
more complex, possibly involving meta-representations, than the report of a single
perceptual uncertainty quantity, which could be explained by entirely first-order
processes 48. Also, it is possible that in individuals' everyday environment, in particular
at home, the metacognitive processes involved in repetitive checking may differ from
those elicited in the lab. Accordingly, it has been shown that personalized cues trigger
increased responses in OCD, compared to non-specific ones 49. Our hypotheses
should thus also be tested in a more ecological environment, such as at participants'
homes. The development of information and communication technologies, and their
recruitment for cognitive tasks, could make it possible to export research outside the
laboratory and improve external validity of cognitive models.
In summary, our findings provide evidence for joint contributions of both explicit, but
not implicit, metacognitive processes, and self-beliefs, including cognitive mistrust, to
checking behavior guided by perceptual uncertainty. Our findings also open
unexplored avenues to address and better understand how the otherwise adaptive
checking behavior could go awry in OCD.
