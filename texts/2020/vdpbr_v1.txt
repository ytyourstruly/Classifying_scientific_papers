ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 2
1 Abstract
2 This paper examines two plausible mechanisms supporting sound category adaptation:
3 directional shifts towards the novel pronunciation or a general category relaxation of criteria.
4 Focusing on asymmetries in adaptation to the voicing patterns of English coronal fricatives, we
5 suggest that typology or synchronic experience affect adaptation. A corpus study of coronal
6 fricative substitution patterns confirmed that North American English listeners are more likely to
7 be exposed to devoiced /z/ than voiced /s/. Across two perceptual adaptation experiments,
8 listeners in test conditions heard naturally produced devoiced /z/ or voiced /s/ in critical items
9 within sentences, while control listeners were exposed to identical sentences with canonical
10 pronunciations. Perceptual adaptation was tested via a lexical decision test, with devoiced /z/ or
11 voiced /s/, as well as a novel alveopalatalized pronunciation, to determine whether adaptation
12 was targeted in the direction of the exposed variant or reflected a more general relaxation.
13 Results indicate there was directional and word-specific adaptation for /z/-devoicing with no
14 evidence for generalization. Conversely, there was evidence of /s/-voicing generalizing and
15 eliciting general category relaxation. These results underscore the role of perceptual experiences,
16 and support an evaluation stage in perceptual learning, where listeners assess whether to update a
17 representation.

1 1. Introduction
2 Due to the enormous amount of linguistic and social information simultaneously
3 available in the speech stream, speech perception is a challenging task. When considering the
4 variability listeners encounter within and across talkers, the act of understanding spoken
5 language becomes an even more complex enterprise. Both within- and between-talker variation
6 can arise due to differences in physiology (e.g., Weirich & Simpson, 2014; Ladefoged &
7 Broadbent, 1957), articulatory control (e.g., Johnson & Beckman, 1997), emotional state and
8 personality (e.g., Dewaele & Li, 2014), and dialect (e.g., Clopper & Smiljanic, 2015). While this
9 list is not exhaustive, such differences result in variable spectral and temporal information that
10 must be processed on some level by listeners for successful recognition and communication.
11 Despite different sources of variation, phonetic variability is typically highly structured —
12 patterns of variation are not random, and listeners are able to exploit both the surrounding
13 linguistic context and talker-specific social information to categorize, comprehend, and adapt to
14 speech (Holt & Bent, 2017; Bradlow & Bent, 2008).
15 1.1. Perceptual Adjustments to Phonemic Categories
16 How do listeners adapt to and accommodate variable pronunciations? Listeners’ rapid
17 adaptation abilities have been studied under the umbrellas of perceptual learning or phonemic
18 recalibration — behaviours that allow for listeners’ adjustments to phonemic categories. In the
19 lab, adaptive behaviours have been extensively tested using an experimental paradigm termed
20 lexically-guided perceptual learning, which generally functions as follows: listeners are exposed
21 to novel or phonetically ambiguous pronunciations of a particular sound in lexical contexts that
22 provide the linguistic scaffolding to guide the interpretation of the intended word. Norris,
23 McQueen, and Cutler (2003) introduced the paradigm using Dutch words containing the
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 4
1 fricatives /f/ and /s/. If an ambiguous sound — denoted [?sf] — was presented in the context of a
2 word like witlof “chicory”, listeners expanded their /f/ category to include these pronunciations.
3 Conversely, if the ambiguous [?sf] sound was heard in the context of an /s/ word like naaldbos
4 “pine forest”, listeners adjusted their /s/ category. The adjusted category boundaries were
5 demonstrated in a categorization task with items on a synthesized [s]-[f] continuum. Listeners
6 who heard the ambiguous sound in /f/ contexts showed learning targeted in a particular direction,
7 expanding their /f/ category to specifically accommodate the ambiguous fricative at the expense
8 of /s/, while those who heard the ambiguous sound in the context of /s/ words expanded their /s/
9 category at the expense of /f/. Crucially, listeners did not make perceptual adjustments when the
10 phonetically ambiguous sound was heard in the context of nonwords, as there was no lexical
11 content listeners could use to make the connection between [?sf] and /s/ or /f/. These adjustments
12 reflect actual retuning of linguistic categories and not exclusively decision criterion shifts
13 (Clarke-Davidson, Luce, and Sawusch, 2008).
14 There seem to be some limitations to perceptual learning, and further identifying and
15 articulating (some of) those limitations is a goal of the current study. Adaptation seems to be
16 limited, for example, if the phonetic ambiguity of the crucial phoneme is extreme, as is the case
17 of heavily non-native-accented speech, where listeners also do not show adaptation (Witteman,
18 Weber, & McQueen, 2013). Likewise, if listeners do not accurately recognize the words with
19 ambiguous pronunciations as words, they are less likely to learn the novel pronunciations
20 (Scharenborg & Janse, 2013). Adaptation appears limited in its generalization to voices and
21 across-languages, only applying when the voices or cross-linguistic patterns share sufficient
22 acoustic-phonetic or perceptual similarity (Eisner & McQueen, 2005; Kraljic & Samuel, 2005;
23 Reinisch & Holt, 2014; Mitterer & Reinisch, 2017, Reinisch, Weber, & Mitterer, 2013).
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 5
1 Together, adaptation requires lexical or other top-down support, in addition to signal-based or
2 bottom-up similarity.
3 Taking advantage of the natural variation in stop realization within and across languages,
4 scholars have identified some additional limits to the generalization of what is learned. For
5 example, native English listeners naive to Dutch-accented English not only show adaptation to
6 the devoiced final-stops in Dutch-accented English, but can generalize voiced stop devoicing to
7 initial position as well, at least when not presented with counterevidence to initial devoicing
8 patterns (Eisner, Melinger, & Weber, 2013). Counterevidence inhibited this learning: listeners do
9 not generalize to initial position when listeners are exposed to items with initial voiced stops,
10 which do not undergo devoicing in Dutch-accented English. When presented with a native
11 English speaker who only exhibited word-final stop devoicing (and not the more global and
12 systematic effects of a non-native accent), listeners showed learning of the pattern, but did not
13 generalize it to word-initial positions, as they had with the Dutch-accented English speaker.
14 These results crucially suggest that the overall accent of a talker informs the generalization
15 strategy. Using Mandarin-accented English, Xie, Theodore, and Myers (2017) demonstrated that
16 adaptation to final /d/-devoicing results in both a recalibration of category boundaries and a
17 reorganization of the category-internal structure. Adaptation was evident in a cross-modal
18 priming task, where listeners showed higher levels of lexical activation for devoiced /d/-final
19 words without negative effect on lexical activation for /t/-final words. These adjustments to
20 Mandarin-accented final-stop devoicing (as observed in the priming data) are different from
21 those results observed by McQueen et al. (2006), who found that listeners completely remapped
22 categories (e.g., negative consequences for doof when training was words like doos).
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 6
1 Adaptation has also been found for vowels (Maye, Aslin, and Tanenhaus, 2008;
2 Witteman et al., 2013; Weatherholtz, 2015; Babel, Senior, & Bishop, 2019). The novel
3 pronunciations used in the work on vowel adaptation implement changes in vowel pronunciation
4 that use or model natural accents, which often fully and categorically replace one vowel quality
5 with that of another vowel category (e.g., tooth pronounced as [tʊθ], not the canonical [tuθ] for
6 North American dialects of English). Some of these vowel studies have tackled the mechanisms
7 of perceptual adaptation by assessing whether exposure to a novel accent adjusts criteria for
8 word identification. For example, Maye et al. (2008) crucially controlled for whether learning
9 was specifically tuned in the targeted direction of the novel pronunciations or whether exposure
10 to a unique accent led to a more general relaxing of criteria for word identification. They
11 accomplished this by testing word endorsement rates of items like [wiʧ] when listeners had been
12 exposed to [wɛʧ] for what is typically pronounced as [wɪʧ] “witch” in North American English.
13 Their results indicate that listeners’ adjustments to the novel pronunciations were targeted in the
14 specific direction of listeners’ exposure, as opposed to a more general relaxation of criteria for
15 what constitutes an acceptable realization of a vowel. Conversely, several experiments in
16 Weatherholtz (2015) do provide evidence of relaxing criteria for vowel categories: listeners
17 exposed to a back vowel raising chain shift learned an exposure-specific pattern, whereas
18 listeners exposed to a back vowel lowering chain shift showed evidence of category relaxation,
19 accepting items that showed a lowering or raising pattern. While the mechanism behind this
20 exposure-specific category relaxation is not understood, it is not necessarily a surprising
21 outcome, as small distortions to a word’s consonant or vowel pronunciations do not impede
22 successful recognition (Connine, Blasko, & Titone, 1993; Connine, Titone, Deelman, & Blasko
23 1997; Andruski, Blumstein, & Burton, 1994; Brouwer, Mitterer, & Huettig, 2012). Successful
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 7
1 recognition of a word despite a deviant pronunciation, however, may or may not have an effect
2 on the subsequent encoding of that item (Todd, Pierrehumbert, & Hay, 2019).
3 The specificity of the category — for example whether what is learned is tied to a
4 phoneme-level, an allophonic-level, or an even more surface-level of representation — appears
5 to be sensitive to the exposure conditions (Eisner et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2017; Mitterer &
6 Reinisch, 2017). What remains unclear about the processes involved is whether a more general
7 category relaxation may be a distinct mechanism that also supports perceptual learning, one that
8 complements a more directionally targeted phonemic recalibration mechanism. Zheng and
9 Samuel (2019) present evidence that phonemic recalibration, accent adaptation, and selective
10 adaptation are all distinct mechanisms. Zheng and Samuel’s approach to accent adaptation
11 leverages a non-native accent that has specific shifts in pronunciation that lead to what have been
12 termed “bad maps” (Sumner, 2011). These “bad maps” are categorical mismatches in
13 pronunciation patterns, as in the case of Mandarin-accented English /θ/ pronounced as [s]. In
14 such cases, there is deviation from a listener’s local accent throughout the signal, though
15 crucially, the acoustics-to-phoneme mapping is more disrupted for particular sound categories.
16 Focusing on such categories, Zheng and Samuel found that listeners exposed to Mandarin-
17 accented English sentences were subsequently more likely to call nonwords words (e.g., calling a
18 nonword like [sæŋkfʊɫ] a word), which indicates general criteria relaxation. Support for a
19 general category relaxation mechanism can also be found in the literature on accent
20 accommodation, both in development (Schmale, Cristia, & Seidl, 2012; Schmale, Seidl, &
21 Cristia, 2015; White & Aslin, 2011), and with adult listeners (Baese-Berk, Bradlow, & Wright,
22 2013). Inconclusive support for expansion mechanisms also comes from computational
23 modelling. Hitzcenko and Feldman (2016) implement Kleinschmidt and Jaeger’s (2015) ideal
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 8
1 adaptor framework in an effort to computationally model the Maye et al. (2008) data and assess
2 whether the mechanism(s) at play in the listeners in Maye and colleagues’ study is one of (i)
3 expanding, (ii) shifting, (iii) shifting and expanding, or (iv) remapping. The relevant parameters
4 are the category means and covariance and the model’s confidence in those values (e.g., high or
5 low). The four implementations hit-and-miss the behavioural data to different degrees, but
6 overall, the expand, shift, and expand and shift models all provide decent fits with models that
7 include expansion perhaps aligning somewhat better to Maye and colleagues’ data.
8 It is important to broach the question of how degree of deviation might limit or constrain
9 the ease with which listeners adapt — or even whether they adapt at all. There are limitations on
10 the acoustic similarity of what kind of substitution is acceptable while still allowing for
11 perceptual adaptation (e.g., Witteman et al., 2013; Babel, McAuliffe, Norton, Senior, & Vaughn,
12 2019), as is the case with other behaviours that showcase perceptual flexibility (e.g., the
13 phoneme restoration effect; Samuel, 1981). Though note, it is possible that simply increasing the
14 amount of exposure may provide a boost in learning for highly divergent pronunciations. There
15 also seem to be other constraints on lexically-guided perceptual learning with such constraints
16 potentially stemming from a number of underlying causes. For example, Krajlic, Brennan, and
17 Samuel (2008a) illustrate that listeners do not adapt to more [ʃ]-like /s/ sounds in the context of
18 str- clusters. In another example, Kraljic, Samuel, and Brennan (2008b) find that listeners do not
19 shift phonetic categories if ambiguous productions are accompanied by video clips suggesting
20 the speaker had a pen in her mouth during production. They reason that if phonetic variation can
21 be attributed to an entity beyond the speaker (i.e., phonologically conditioned dialect patterns or
22 a pen-in-mouth disruptions), listeners will fail to learn the pattern (for a similar account, see
23 Cutler, 2012). Alternatively, if there is not sufficient lexical activation to support the mapping of
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 9
1 the novel pronunciation to a phonemic category, boundary adjustments do not occur (Jesse &
2 McQueen, 2011; McAuliffe & Babel, 2016). Thus, the amount or nature of phonetic variation,
3 quantity of exposed items, talker-related attribution (i.e., causal inference), and lack of top-down
4 support may all constrain listeners’ perceptual adjustments.
5 Lastly, we can also ask whether all speech sounds are updated equivalently in perceptual
6 learning paradigms. The answer to this question appears to be no. Zhang and Samuel (2014)
7 report on a lexically-guided perceptual learning study where listeners were exposed to an
8 ambiguous /s/-/f/ fricative in the context of /s/ or /f/ words in highly predictable sentences. In
9 addition to showing perceptual learning in clear speech, conversational speech, and under two
10 cognitive load manipulations, Zhang and Samuel found an asymmetry across the /s/ and /f/
11 conditions. Compared to a control condition, listeners exposed to the ambiguous fricative in the
12 context of /s/ words learned the novel pronunciation, generalizing their updated category
13 distribution to the categorization test stimuli. Listeners exposed to the same ambiguous fricative
14 in the context of /f/, however, did not. Zhang and Samuel’s explanation for this hinges on the less
15 robust spectral cues for /f/ compared to /s/, suggesting that listeners may simply be less sensitive
16 to phonetic variation in non-sibilant fricatives. Note, however, that several other studies have
17 found evidence for the perceptual retuning of /f/ in the face of /s/ (e.g., Schuhmann, 2014;
18 Bruggeman & Cutler, 2020; Reinisch & Holt, 2014; and for retuning of /f/ compared to a control
19 group, see Chan, Johnson, & Babel, 2020). Drozdova, Van Hout, and Scharenborg (2016) also
20 uncover an asymmetry in the perceptual retuning of /l/ and /ɹ/ in British English with British
21 English and Dutch (L2 English) listeners. Dutch listeners showed more recalibration for English
22 /ɹ/ than the British English listeners, which Drozdova and colleagues link to the wide range of
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 10
1 rhotic variation in (L1) Dutch, reasoning that this larger phonetic range allows listeners to tap
2 into pre-existing variation they have been exposed to, and thus adapt with ease.
3 This overview of the theoretical and empirical literature on adaptation leads to the
4 objectives for the current study, which are multifaceted. We seek to (i) directly test whether
5 asymmetries in sound patterns affect perceptual adjustments, and (ii) assess whether the
6 adaptation mechanism is targeted in the direction of the exposed pronunciation or reflects a
7 general relaxing of criteria or both. We investigate a potential asymmetry in perceptual learning
8 by testing the learnability of changes in the voiced and voiceless English coronal fricatives: /z/
9 and /s/. Specifically, we assess whether listeners perform differently when exposed to naturally-
10 produced devoiced /z/ (perceived as [s]) and voiced /s/ (perceived as [z]). This question has roots
11 in questions about learnability in phonology (e.g., the presence of channel biases in phonology;
12 e.g., Moreton & Pater, 2012b, Martin and Peperkamp, 2020), and in whether there are boundary
13 conditions on retuning for novel pronunciations in lexically-guided perceptual learning.
14 We use a lexical decision task as a test of perceptual learning, and quantify differences in
15 word endorsement rates across experimental and control groups for items with a voicing change
16 (i.e., /z/-devoicing or /s/-voicing). This paradigm allows us to quantify both learning specificity
17 and the generalization of the learned (or not) voicing change in novel words not presented during
18 the exposure phase. As opposed to the two-alternative forced choice categorization task often
19 used in phoneme recalibration studies, our use of a lexical decision paradigm to quantify learning
20 has the distinct advantage of allowing us to test whether phonemic adjustments are directional,
21 showing increased word endorsement only in the direction of the exposed change, or whether the
22 adjustments involve general relaxation of category boundaries. To assess whether exposure to
23 devoiced /z/ or voiced /s/ results in directional adaptation or general relaxation, we tested word
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 11
1 endorsement rates of both [s] and [ʒ] pronunciations in canonical /z/ words. Endorsement of [ʒ]
2 pronunciations in addition to [s] pronunciations would be evidence in support of a general
3 category relaxation mechanism. Likewise, [ʃ] pronunciations in canonical /s/ words are used to
4 test category relaxation in response to exposure to /s/-voicing. Both the voicing change shifts and
5 the place of articulation shifts are pronunciation changes of one feature edit distance from the
6 canonical pronunciation, and as a result are close to the canonical productions. Following our
7 corpus study in Section 2, we provide much more finely honed predictions of listener behaviour.
8 1.2. Coronal Fricatives in English
9 English coronal fricatives offer a nice test case because they are clearly asymmetrical in
10 their cross-linguistic distribution and within-English voicing patterns. English coronal fricatives
11 also have attested, but apparently rare, alveopalatalized variants in casual speech (at least in the
12 Buckeye Corpus (Pitt et al., 2007); see corpus study in Section 2). Aerodynamic constraints
13 make voiced fricatives less common cross-linguistically compared to voiceless fricatives (Ohala,
14 1983; Moran & McCloy, 2019). Devoicing patterns are logically assumed to result from the
15 difficulty in maintaining the pressure gradient between the oral and subglottal cavities required
16 to maintain voiced turbulent airstreams. The difficulty of maintaining voicing during fricative
17 production explains why voiceless fricatives are typically longer in duration than their voiced
18 counterparts. These aerodynamic constraints result in devoicing patterns being described as more
19 phonetically natural, particularly for obstruents in utterance-final position (Ladefoged &
20 Johnson, 2011). Also, phonological rules of English fricative final-devoicing are more common
21 than the reverse — within and across varieties of English — though there is the small set of
22 voiceless fricative final words which can voice when coupled with the plural morpheme (e.g.,
23 houses can be pronounced as [haʊsəz] or [haʊzəz]; MacKenzie, 2018). In a study of such words,
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 12
1 MacKenzie (2018) finds that /s/-voicing rates are dropping precipitously in apparent time, further
2 reiterating the asymmetry between /s/-voicing and /z/-devoicing. Overall, both cross-linguistic
3 and English-specific patterns favour the learnability of /z/-devoicing and the reduced learnability
4 of /s/-voicing, offering a clear test for whether asymmetries in phonemic adjustments are biased
5 by experience.
6 While there is at least one dialect of English that engages in word-initial fricative voicing
7 (West Country English; Wells, 1982), voicing of phonologically voiceless fricatives is rare both
8 within and across English dialects. Conversely, word-final fricative devoicing is widely
9 documented in varieties of American and British English (e.g., Docherty, 1992; Veatch, 1989;
10 Stevens, Blumstein, Glicksman, Burton, & Kurowski, 1992). Similarly, many languages have
11 phonological patterns where obstruent voicing contrasts are described as neutralizing in word-
12 final positions. Phonetic studies illustrate that these neutralizations are often incomplete, with
13 subtle acoustic-phonetic cues differentiating the underlying obstruent categories (e.g., Warner,
14 Good, Jongman, & Sereno, 2006; Warner, Jongman, Sereno, & Kemps, 2004; and references
15 therein). Kleber, John, and Harrington (2010) demonstrate that naive listeners are perceptually
16 sensitive to incomplete neutralizations, and use subtle acoustic distinctions in recognition
17 (although far from categorically). In an artificial language learning study, Myers and Padgett
18 (2014) demonstrated that English-speaking listeners more readily learned an utterance-final
19 fricative devoicing pattern compared to a voicing pattern, though participants learned and
20 generalized both patterns to word-final utterance-medial environments. To maintain our focus on
21 phoneme-specific adjustments, we focus on adaptation to fricative voicing changes in word-
22 medial position where the pattern is not tied to morphological alternations, but rather to
23 pronunciation variation attributable to a speaker or dialect.
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 13
1 Smith (1997) examined the propensity to devoice /z/ in English in depth for a small set of
2 speakers (n=4) in utterances where the target fricatives occurred in word-initial, word-medial,
3 word-final, and utterance-final position. As a testament to the multidimensional nature of voicing
4 contrasts, Smith measured vocal fold vibration with an electroglottograph (EGG), duration of the
5 fricatives and the preceding vowels, and oral airflow. Smith found that her four talkers varied
6 considerably in terms of the degree of /z/-devoicing — one speaker typically produced vocal fold
7 vibration throughout /z/, one speaker produced most of her /z/ tokens with no vocal fold
8 vibration, and two speakers who typically vibrated their vocal folds for some portion of the
9 fricative. Three of the four speakers produced a clear duration difference between /z/ and /s/,
10 regardless of whether the /z/ was realized as voiced, partially devoiced, or fully devoiced.
11 Speakers produced longer vowels before phonologically voiced /z/, although three of the four
12 speakers did not produce longer vowels before phonologically voiced /z/ when produced with
13 full voicing. Generally, across all types of /z/ realizations, speakers produced /z/ with lower
14 mean and maximum airflow. Together, these results suggest that the difference between /s/ and
15 /z/ extends well beyond the categorical distinction of whether or not vocal folds are vibrating.
16 Smith summarizes her results as providing evidence that American English speakers can
17 “devoice /z/ in almost any environment” (Smith, 1997: 498).
18 Thus, not only is there typological evidence that voiced fricatives are more likely to
19 devoice than the reverse, but at least in lab speech, English /z/ is more likely to devoice than /s/
20 is to voice. There is no literature, to our knowledge, documenting the probability or magnitude of
21 /s/-voicing. This lack of evidence, however, does not mean /s/-voicing does not exist. Thus, to
22 assess /z/-devoicing and /s/-voicing on a categorical level and to quantify listeners’ previous
23 experience with sibilant fricatives and voicing patterns, we consider spontaneous speech, which
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 14
1 exhibits large amounts of reduction and pronunciation variation (Johnson, 2004; Pluymaekers
2 and Ernestus, 2005).
3 2. Experiment 1: Corpus Study of /s/ and /z/ Realizations in the Buckeye Corpus
4 We estimate listeners’ previous experience with voiced /s/ and devoiced /z/ by comparing
5 expected citation forms to pronounced forms of voiced and voiceless fricatives in the Buckeye
6 Corpus (Pitt et al., 2007). The Buckeye Corpus is a collection of recordings of spontaneous
7 conversational speech from 40 white native speakers of English from Columbus, Ohio, USA, and
8 has detailed phonetic transcriptions for all recordings. We use this corpus because of its size, the
9 casual nature of the spontaneous speech, and the crucial fact that it is phonetically transcribed.
10 Our approach uses categorical coding of fricative categories in the Buckeye Corpus: we examine
11 categorical changes in the transcription character symbol selected to represent the surface form
12 for what is /s/ or /z/ in the canonical citation forms. This was done using the transcription data in
13 the phonetic and citation tiers of the Buckeye Corpus.
14 2.1. Methods
15 2.1.2. Materials
16 As the goal was to assess the overall probability of categorical voicing changes for all /s/
17 and /z/, regardless of position in the word (or participation in morphophonological processes), all
18 items with /s/ or /z/ in any position in the expected citation form transcriptions were identified in
19 the Buckeye Corpus. This resulted in 38,934 instances of citation /s/ and 23,076 instances of
20 citation /z/.
21 2.1.3. Procedure
22 The surface behaviour of the coronal fricatives was assessed from the phonetic
23 transcripts. An automated procedure separated items into matches or items that required human
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 15
1 decisions. Items where the citation form (e.g., “dictionary” pronunciation) and the phonetically-
2 transcribed pronounced surface form showed perfect alignment (e.g., there were no changes
3 between citation and pronounced forms) were automatically tagged as matches. There were
4 17,448 perfect matches for /s/ items (44.8%) and 8,831 perfect matches for /z/ items (38.2%).
5 Fricatives were also automatically paired and identified as substitutions in citation and surface
6 forms if the two strings matched in terms of both the number of characters and the identity of all
7 characters except the citation form /s/ or /z/. For example, a word like there’s with the dictionary
8 pronunciation of <dh eh r z> that was transcribed in the Buckeye as <dh eh r zh> (filename
9 s0101b.word, timestamp 44.59) was automatically coded as a [z] to [ʒ] substitution. However,
10 there’s that was transcribed as <eh r z> (filename: s2402a.word, timestamp: 328.105) was sent to
11 the human decisions list.1 Just less than 1% of citation /s/ items were automatically identified as
12 substitutions, but 10.3% of /z/ citations were; and all but 1% of those were cases where /z/
13 devoiced to [s].
14 The remaining items were manually matched by annotators in a custom-written
15 command-line program using the following process: the citation transcription was presented with
16 the item’s pronounced transcription. The fricative of interest was visually flagged by a symbol
17 (>) in the citation pronunciation and the characters in the pronounced word were numbered.
18 Using the transcriptions alone (without audio), annotators identified the number in the citation
19 form string associated with the fricative of interest or marked the fricative as deleted from the
20 string.
The Buckeye corpus uses Arpabet transcriptions and those are used in our reporting from this corpus.

1 2.2. Results
2 The counts for labels that were automatically and manually applied are shown for /s/ and
3 /z/ words in Tables 1 and 2. There are many instances of applied categories that have small
4 counts and are likely erroneous labels due to mistakes in the human decision process or overly
5 simple assumptions for our automatic labeling (e.g., /s/ as [ɑ]). What is clear from these numbers
6 is that /s/ is much less likely to surface as [z] than /z/ is to surface as [s]. Over 96% of /s/ words
7 have an [s] as their transcribed category, and only 1% of /s/ words were transcribed as [z]. On the
8 other hand, 77% of /z/ words are labeled with [z], and a total of 18% of words were transcribed
9 with an [s] in place of the citation /z/. These data from spontaneous speech confirm prior
10 laboratory findings: /z/ is much more likely to surface as [s] than /s/ is to surface as [z].
11 The voicing-matched alveopalatal English fricatives are equally likely to surface: [ʃ] and
12 [ʒ] both occur 1.7% of the time for /s/ and /z/, respectively. This equivalence is useful in our
13 adjudication between directional adaptation and general category relaxation, as both substitutions
14 are attested, but equivalently unlikely.

2 2.3. Discussion and Predictions
3 The results of this corpus study confirm that, at least for this dialect of North American
4 English, listeners are more likely to be exposed to /z/-devoicing than /s/-voicing in spontaneous
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 19
1 speech.2 The probability of listeners hearing substitutions of [ʒ] for /z/ and [ʃ] for /s/ is low but
2 roughly equivalent. These data allow us to clarify our predictions for how asymmetries in sound
3 patterns will impact adaptation and acceptability of category variation.
4 We predicted that English listeners would be willing to identify words with /z/-devoicing
5 as words a priori, but that exposure to devoiced /z/ in lexical contexts would cause listeners to be
6 even more likely to identify these items as words. We expected that listeners exposed to
7 devoiced /z/ would update their expectations about the talker in the experiment, and generalize to
8 novel devoiced /z/ words, as this talker would be labelled a “devoicer”. Given that the devoiced
9 /z/ taps into previous experiences with devoiced /z/, we expected that listeners would not
10 generally relax category boundaries for /z/. That is, after being exposed to devoiced /z/, we did
11 not expect listeners to change their threshold for /z/, such that [ʒ] pronunciations would become
12 acceptable.
13 Conversely, we expected listeners to exhibit a different response for /s/, as fully voiced /s/
14 is incredibly rare. While we anticipated that exposure to voiced /s/ pronunciations would increase
15 the identification of these items as words, we expected this pattern to be qualitatively different
16 from the word endorsement rates for the more frequent pattern of /z/-devoicing, as this reflects
17 listeners’ experiences with the more probable /z/-devoicing than /s/-voicing; the baseline word
18 endorsement rates for /z/-devoicing are predicted to be much higher than those for the /s/-
19 voicing. Because /s/-voicing is such a rare change in listeners’ experiences, the talker may
20 essentially be labelled as atypical and the adaptation mechanism may be different, reflecting the
While we acknowledge that the population sample of the Buckeye Corpus (Midland American English in
Columbus, Ohio) is not identical to that of the listener population sample (Canadian English in Vancouver, British
Columbia), the fricative voicing patterns are robust to the point that we assume the basic pattern holds for speakers
of Canadian English as well given that, to our knowledge, no previous literature suggests major differences in
fricative voicing patterns in North American English.

1 listener’s lower degree of certainty that the produced [z] indeed maps onto the /s/ category.
2 Under this general relaxation response scenario, listeners may show increased acceptability of [ʃ]
3 pronunciations as well as to novel words with a [z] pronunciation. Given the rarity of [ʒ] for /z/
4 and [ʃ] for /s/ in spontaneous speech, we anticipated these items as having lower word
5 endorsement rates than items with the voicing change for listeners in the control groups, who

12 3. Material Selection for Experiments 2 and 3
13 Experiments 2 and 3 target different critical sounds — /z/ and /s/ — but share a procedure
14 for creating the stimuli. Section 3 outlines this process and the process of winnowing to a final
15 stimuli list. Relevant acoustic characteristics of the stimuli are also described in this section.
16 Sections 4 and 5 report on the experiments that used these stimuli.
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 21
1 3.1. Word and Sentence Selection
2 Target lexical items with non-initial /s/ or /z/ were identified. These items contained only
3 a single sibilant fricative. To reduce ambiguity in the lexical frame, these items were confirmed
4 to not be able to form words if the target fricative was replaced by another fricative (see the list
5 of stimuli in the Appendix). Further, all targets had two to four syllables, and were embedded
6 within moderately predictable sentences containing no sibilant fricatives other than the critical /s/
7 or /z/. Filler sentences (n = 100) were composed with no sibilant fricatives.
8 3.2. Audio Recordings
9 An adult female monolingual English speaker produced the sentence and single word
10 materials. These auditory stimuli were recorded using a head-mounted microphone with a
11 SoundDevices USB PreAMP in a sound-attenuated cubicle at a 44.1kHz sampling rate with 16
12 bit depth. Recorded materials were trimmed of extraneous silence and RMS-amplitude
13 normalized to 70 dB, ensuring no clipped samples. Three versions of each critical /s/ and /z/
14 sentence were recorded, corresponding to the canonical pronunciation (control), (de)voicing, and
15 alveopalatalized item types. To address the potential for unintended mispronunciations and
16 inconsistencies, the speaker produced several instances of each critical sentence and word. The
17 final recordings were selected based on perceived clarity and consistency by the third author.
18 3.2.1. Pronunciation Accuracy: Transcription
19 Critical items from the sentences were excised and presented to two trained linguists
20 blind to the purpose of the experiment along with all of the filler single word items. Each linguist
21 independently phonetically transcribed each item, which were presented in a unique random
22 order without word-level labels. This was done to confirm that the critical words with the
23 (de)voicing and alveopalatal pronunciations were categorically perceived as intended. Any items
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 22
1 where the transcribers disagreed or where the transcription did not match the intended voicing or
2 place were eliminated from the pool of potential materials.
3 3.2.2. Pronunciation Accuracy: Acoustics
4 The items selected based on transcription accuracy were also confirmed to be appropriate
5 via acoustic analysis. The onsets and offsets of aperiodic energy associated with frication were
6 used to identify the fricative. Using the identified interval, three measurements were made: (i)
7 the percentage unvoiced of the fricative was estimated using the Praat Voice Report function
8 (Boersma and Weenink, 2020), (ii) the raw fricative duration, and (iii) the duration of the
9 fricative divided by the duration of the word it occurred in — henceforth, ratio duration. These
10 three measurements were used to assess whether there are reliable differences in the
11 manifestation of voicing when the underlying fricative differs, and when the item was produced
12 in a sentence (for exposure) versus in isolation (for test). For example, is the [s] in assembly as
14 summary statistics for all stimuli types used in the experiment as well as the same words
15 pronounced canonically. Canonical productions of single words were recorded separately
16 explicitly for these acoustic comparisons.
17 As these data show, items produced as [s] in word and sentence contexts are more likely
18 to be unvoiced, have longer raw fricative durations, and longer ratio durations than items that
19 were produced with [z], regardless of whether the canonical form contained /s/ or /z/. To
20 quantify whether exposure sentence stimuli were well-matched, and to corroborate the
21 transcription described in the previous section, the following comparisons were made.
22 To assess the acoustic equivalence of target words in the exposure stimuli, underlying
23 target /s/ words produced with [s] from the control condition of Experiment 3 (/s/-voicing, n =
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 23
1 36) were compared with devoiced /z/ words from the experimental condition of Experiment 2
2 (/z/-devoicing, n = 36). Similarly, underlying target /z/ words produced as [z] in the control
3 condition of the /z/-devoicing experiment (n = 36) were compared with voiced /s/ words (n = 36)
4 from the experimental condition of Experiment 3 (/s/-voicing). A series of ANOVAs were run
5 separately for [s] and [z] items (but differing in underlying representation), using percentage
6 unvoiced, fricative duration, and ratio duration as dependent measures and the underlying
7 fricative as the single independent variable. There were no significant effects, suggesting that [s]
8 and [z] were produced consistently in sentence contexts regardless of the voicing of the fricative
9 in the canonical pronunciation of the word.
10 To assess the acoustic equivalence of the single word test items, underlying /z/ items
11 produced as [s] (n = 36) and underlying /s/ items produced as [z] (n = 36) were compared to the
12 /s/ and /z/ items produced in their canonical form, respectively; again, these canonical single
13 word items are not used as stimuli, but were recorded to make these comparisons. The fricatives
14 from single word environments were assessed separately for [s] and [z] pronunciations through a
15 series of ANOVAs with percentage unvoiced, fricative duration, and ratio duration as dependent
16 measures with the underlying fricative as an independent variable. There was no significant
17 effect of underlying fricative in any of the three ANOVAs. Together, these results suggest that
18 the pronunciation of the /z/ as [s] and /s/ as [z] in sentence and word contexts well-matched
19 canonical pronunciations of /z/ and /s/ by the same speaker.
20 The /s/ as [ʃ] and /z/ as [ʒ] test items were not compared to /ʃ/ and /ʒ/ as produced by this
21 speaker in natural contexts because appropriate comparison items were not recorded.
22 Nonetheless, [ʃ] and [ʒ] are well-matched to [s] and [z], respectively, in terms of acoustic

9 4. Experiment 2: Learning /z/-devoicing
10 In Experiment 2 listeners were presented with devoiced /z/ using a sentence exposure
11 task. Perceptual adaptation was assessed by listeners’ endorsements of items with devoiced /z/ as
12 words in a lexical decision test following the exposure phase. Generalization was tested through
13 the presentation of novel devoiced /z/ words, which comprised items not presented in the
14 exposure phase. To determine whether adaptation was targeted in the direction of /z/-devoicing
15 or reflected a more general relaxation of /z/ criteria, items containing [ʒ] in place of [s] were
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 25
1 included in the second half of the test block — of these, half were heard during the exposure
2 phase with [s], and half were novel /z/ words. The performance of listeners exposed to the
3 devoiced /z/ items in exposure was compared to those in a control group who heard the same
4 items with canonical /z/ pronunciations during exposure. All participants completed the same
5 lexical decision test.
6 4.1. Methods
7 We report on materials and procedures first, followed by participants, as this order allows
8 us to contextualize participant outlier removal in a more transparent manner.
9 4.1.1. Materials
10 The final stimuli for the exposure phase for Experiment 2 consisted of 56 semantically
11 coherent filler sentences, randomly sampled from the 100 possible filler sentences, and two
12 versions of the 14 semantically predictable critical sentences, in which pronunciation patterns
13 and intonation of the sentence was consistent, but the voicing of the /z/ in the target word in the
14 sentence varied according to condition. The control version comprised sentence-final critical
15 words produced in their canonical form (e.g., busy [bɪzi]). In the experimental /z/-devoicing
16 condition, the sibilant in the sentence-final /z/ word was produced as [s] (e.g., busy [bɪsi]). The
17 test stimuli for the test phase consisted of the 14 critical exposure words (produced as single
18 words) from training, 14 novel /z/ words (randomly sampled per participant from a possible list
19 of 22 items), 42 nonwords (phonotactically-legal maximal pseudowords3 randomly sampled per
20 participant from a pool of 110 nonwords), and 70 filler words (randomly sampled per participant
21 from a pool of 103 filler words), some of which happened to be presented in the exposure
Maximal here refers to the fact that the pseudowords differed from any real word with respect to multiple phones.
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 26
1 sentences.4 The large number of filler words served to bias listeners to respond to the devoiced
2 /z/ items as nonwords. The yoking of particular items to the exposure phase — and thus
3 particular heard and novel items at test — was due to limitations of which stimuli were viable in
4 terms of inter-transcriber agreement. A list of the final experimental materials used in this
5 experiment is provided in the Appendix. Lexical frequency (log frequency per million) of items
6 in the final word list was estimated with the SUBTLEX-us corpus (Brysbaert & New, 2009). The
7 frequency of /z/ items used in exposure (M = 2.23, SD = 0.66) was not different than those used
8 as novel items (M = 2.05, SD = 0.67; Welch’s t(28.36) = 0.81, p = 0.42).
9 4.1.2. Procedure
10 Participants completed the task up to four at a time in sound-attenuated cubicles outfitted
11 with AKG headphones, a desktop PC, and a PST serial response box. All auditory stimuli were
12 presented at a comfortable listening level (approximately 65dB SPL) over the headphones. The
13 experiment was controlled by E-Prime 2.0 software (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh,
14 PA).
15 As noted previously, the study comprised two parts: an exposure phrase with auditorily
16 presented sentences and an auditory lexical decision test phase. Half of the participants were
17 assigned to a control condition where /z/ words were produced with the canonical voiced [z]
18 pronunciation, and half were assigned to the experimental /z/-devoicing condition where all /z/
19 exposure items were devoiced and pronounced as [s]. The lexical decision test phase was
20 identical for the two groups of listeners.
There was no intention of balancing or controlling for the presence or absence of filler words in the filler
sentences. The overlap varied by participant, as each participant’s list was randomly sampled from the viable pool of
items, and the overlap simply existed as a function of our lack of creativity composing semantically coherent
sentences that lacked the critical sounds of interest.
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 27
1 In the exposure phase, 70 sentences (14 critical, 56 filler) were presented in a pseudo-
2 random order such that no two critical trials were adjacent. The number of filler sentences
3 presented before the first critical sentence varied randomly from six to eight across experimental
4 conditions. Participants were informed to listen carefully to the sentences and falsely instructed
5 that there would be comprehension questions following the sentence list, but otherwise not
6 required to do anything while listening to the presented stimuli. Each sentence was separated by
7 a 2000 ms pause. Participants were allowed a self-timed break after the exposure phase.
8 The lexical decision test phase began after the participants’ self-administered break.
9 Participants were presented with a single item over headphones and were asked to classify the
10 item as a “word” or “not a word” using the button box provided. The buttons “1” or “5” for
11 “word” and “not a word” were counterbalanced across participants. These response options were
12 visually presented — numerically and orthographically — on a computer monitor and
13 participants were given up to 1500 ms to respond. All items (n = 140) were pseudo-randomized
14 across participants as described below. There were 42 nonwords and 70 filler words, none of
15 which contained sibilant fricatives. In the first half of the test block, listeners were presented
16 with 14 critical items where the underlying /z/ was pronounced as a [s]. Half of these test items
17 had occurred in the exposure sentences and half were novel words. These items were fully
18 randomized within the block. The second half of the test block contained 14 critical items that
19 tested for general relaxation of the /z/ category, in which the fricative was pronounced as [ʒ].
20 Half of these items were lexical items that had occurred in the exposure sentences (with the
21 exposure pronunciation as [s] or [z] depending on the condition) and half were novel in the
22 context of the experiment. After completing the exposure and test phases, listeners completed a
23 language background questionnaire. Participants who inquired about the (lack of) comprehension
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 28
1 questions for the sentences were informed that those instructions were included to ensure they
2 attended to the sentences.
3 4.1.3. Participants
4 A total of 135 adults from the Metro Vancouver community participated in this study.
5 Participants’ data were removed prior to the analysis if they did not report English as one their
6 native languages (n = 55), reported a speech/hearing impairment (n = 1), or were below 90%
7 accuracy on filler items (n = 5; following the exclusionary criteria of Sumner & Samuel, 2009).
8 Seventy-four participants were retained for the analysis (Control: n = 32, Experimental: n = 42).
9 Participants varied in gender (47 female, 23 male, 5 did not report), and of those who reported
10 their age (n = 72), the majority were undergraduate student-aged (M = 20.18, Mdn = 20, SD =
11 2.26). Participants self-identified with various racial and ethnic backgrounds (White = 22,
12 Chinese = 14, South Asian = 10, Filipino = 6, Korean = 5, Other/Mixed = 17), and typically had
13 knowledge of multiple languages (M = 3.22 , SD = 1.73), including English. Participants were
14 compensated with partial course credit or $10 CAD.
16 4.2. Analysis and Results
17 Participant responses were removed if the reaction time was below 200 ms, or more than
18 three standard deviations above the grand mean — this resulted in the removal of 0.2% of the
19 data.
20 The experimental data were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel logistic regression
21 models implemented with the brms R package (Bürkner, 2017). The brms package provides a
22 simple interface to the popular and widely-used Stan probabilistic programming language (Stan
23 Development Team, 2021), and adopts the familiar formula specification of models. Bayesian
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 29
1 analysis methods are desirable from both conceptual and practical perspectives, as outlined by
2 Vasishth and colleagues in a 2018 tutorial paper on the topic (Vasishth et al., 2018). While
3 similar to frequentist mixed effects models in accounting for variability in the population (“fixed
4 effects”) and between groups within the population (“random effects”), Bayesian models allow
5 for graded statements about the strength of evidence for all parameters. A practical benefit is that
6 Bayesian models can be fit with maximal random effects and not run into convergence problems.
7 Inference in Bayesian models is based on the posterior distributions of parameters, which
8 represent a range of possible parameter values accompanied by probabilities, rather than the
9 point estimates provided in frequentist models. The posterior distribution is a combination of
10 prior expectations (discussed below) and the likelihood of observing the data under the model.
11 The posterior distribution gives information about the size of the effect and the confidence with
12 which the effect size can be interpreted. As the models described in this paper use logistic
13 regression, the posterior distributions represent the possible parameter values in the log odds
14 space. For example, a posterior distribution with most of its probability mass in the [2.3, 4.6]
15 range indicates that the parameter leads to a 10-fold to 100-fold increase in odds for the response
16 variable — that is, the parameter indicates a large effect size. As Bayesian models also allow us
17 to express a degree of confidence in an effect’s direction, by reporting the proportion of the
18 posterior distribution with the same direction as the posterior mean. Prose descriptions of
19 confidence are necessarily subjective, and we use the following conventions: probabilities equal
20 to 1 represent strong or consistent evidence, probabilities between 0.9 and 1 represent moderate
21 evidence, probabilities between 0.8 and 0.9 are weak, and those below 0.8 offer little to no
22 evidence.
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 30
1 In all models, the dependent variable was Word Endorsement, where 1 corresponds to
2 participants’ response of “word”, and 0 to “not a word”. Each of the models had population-level
3 (fixed) effects for Item Type, Condition, and their interaction. Both were weighted effect coded
4 categorical variables, in which levels are compared against the weighted mean. For example, the
5 effect for a specific level of Item Type would indicate that the level differs from the weighted
6 mean across all levels. Weighted effect coding accounts for unbalanced data (i.e., more filler
7 items than critical items) and facilitates the interpretation of both main effects and interactions
8 (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2017). When levels are balanced, weighted effect coding is identical to
9 effect coding.5 Levels and weights are reported for each model below. Additionally, in all
10 models, there were by-Participant random slopes for Item Type. This is summarised in the brms
11 formula used for each model: Word Endorsement ~ Item Type × Condition + (1 + Item Type |
12 Participant) + (1 | Word).
13 Models also shared general specifications. Priors for the intercept and all population-level
14 effects were regularizing, weakly informative Student’s t distributions (𝜈 = 3, μ = 0, σ = 2.5),
15 following the recommendations from Gelman (2020) and Vasishth et al. (2018). This prior
16 largely serves to keep parameter estimates within a sensible range for the log-odds space — that
17 is, approximately 93% of this t distribution falls between log odds of −6.9 and 6.9, which
18 corresponds to probabilities of 0.001 and 0.999, respectively. While extreme parameter values
19 are possible with this prior, the prior is regularizing because it requires more evidence for
20 extreme parameter values to be reflected in the posterior. The default weakly informative brms
21 priors for the group-level and correlations of group-level parameters were used — Student's t (𝜈
22 = 3, μ = 0, σ = 2.5), half Student's t (𝜈 = 3, μ = 0, σ = 2.5), and LKJ correlation (η = 1)

ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 31
1 distributions, respectively. All models were run with four chains. Each chain had 5,000 iterations
2 (including 2,500 warm-up iterations). This resulted in a total of 10,000 post-warmup samples in
3 each model. Across all models, there were no divergent transitions, and 𝑅 values were very close
4 to 1 (and all < 1.05), which indicates that chains were well-mixed and that all models converged.
5 Likewise, the effective sample size for all population-level effects was sufficiently large. For
6 discussion regarding model specifications, see Vasishth, Nicenboim, Beckman, Li, and Kong
7 (2018), and McElreath (2020: p. 287). In the following sections, results are reported as posterior
8 mean estimates of model parameters (β), along with 95% highest density credible intervals
9 (henceforth, CrI) — the narrowest interval that contains 95% of the posterior distribution. As
10 noted above, the posterior distribution of a parameter indicates a range of possible parameter
11 values and their associated probabilities. While the interpretation of the posterior mean is
12 analogous to the point estimates provided in frequentist mixed-effects models, the posterior
13 distribution as a whole offers a richer picture. As the credible intervals for some parameters span
14 zero, the probability of the effect’s direction is also reported (i.e., if β is negative, the probability
15 of β < 0).
16 4.2.1. Model: Learning /z/-devoicing
17 This model assesses whether or not participants learned /z/-devoicing, and excludes
18 critical test items that were not previously heard during exposure. In the model, Item Type was
19 weighted effect coded with four levels (Item Type Filler: Filler Word = 1 , [s] = 0, [ʒ] = 0,
20 Nonword = −1.69; Item Type Heard [s]: Filler = 0, [s] = 1, [ʒ] = 0, Nonword = −0.17; Item Type
21 Heard [ʒ]: Filler = 0, [s] = 0, [ʒ] = 1, Nonword = −0.16). Condition was weighted effect coded
22 with two levels (Control = 1, Experimental = −0.76). Participants’ mean word endorsement rates

4 2 focused on word endorsement behaviour for filler words, filler nonwords, and words presented

10 critical items across the two conditions used in the analysis of learning /z/-devoicing.
12 The model intercept indicates that there is a slight and consistent bias to endorse items as
13 words (β = 2.09, CrI = [1.69, 2.53], Pr(β > 0) = 1). There is evidence that participants in the
14 Control condition have a slightly higher word endorsement rate overall (β = 0.30, CrI = [0.02,
15 0.59], Pr(β > 0) = 0.98). Filler word items were very likely to be endorsed as words (β = 3.96,
16 CrI = [3.59, 4.37], Pr(β > 0) = 1), and the Condition × Item Type Filler interaction indicates that

1 Control participants were slightly more likely to endorse filler words as words (β = 0.24, CrI =
2 [0.04, 0.48], Pr(β > 0) = 0.99), providing evidence that Experimental condition listeners may
3 have globally adjusted their criteria for word endorsement, becoming more conservative and
4 calling fewer filler items words — we offer possible explanations for this in the interim
5 discussion. Overall, the population-level parameter for Item Type [s] provides evidence that
6 previously heard [s] items are more likely to be endorsed as words (β = 1.39, CrI = [0.36, 2.40],
7 Pr(β > 0) = 0.99). The interaction of Condition and Item Type [s] provides strong evidence that
8 Control listeners were somewhat less likely to identify [s] pronunciations as words (β = −0.76,
9 CrI = [−1.27, −0.28], Pr(β < 0) = 1). This is clear evidence in support of an adjustment to [s]
10 pronunciations in /z/ words for the Experimental participants. While critical items presented as
11 [ʒ] were less likely to be endorsed as words for both experimental and control listener groups (β
12 = −2.68 , CrI = [−3.90, −1.55], Pr(β < 0) = 1), the evidence that conditions differed in how they
13 responded to [ʒ] items was weak (β = −0.44, CrI = [−1.34, 0.48], Pr(β < 0) = 0.84). Together
14 with the low estimate for Item Type [ʒ], this indicates that, overall, listeners in both conditions
15 were very unlikely to endorse these items as words, though note the wide range of variability in

4 indicated by the vertical tick mark.
6 4.2.2. Model: Generalizing /z/-devoicing
7 A second model addressed the question of whether participants generalized their learning
8 of /z/-devoicing to novel words, that is, words not heard during the exposure phase. For this
9 model, Filler Words and Nonwords were excluded, and all critical items included (both Heard
10 and Novel). All aspects of the model structure were identical to that of the previous section, with
11 the following exceptions. Item Type was weighted effect coded with four levels (Item Type
12 Novel [s]: Heard [s] = −0.97, Novel [s] = 1, Heard [ʒ] = 0, Novel [ʒ] = 0; Item Type Heard [ʒ]:
13 Heard [s] = −0.94, Novel [s] = 0, Heard [ʒ] = 1, Novel [ʒ] = 0; Item Type Novel[ʒ]: Heard [s] =
14 −0.94, Novel [s] = 0, Heard [ʒ] = 0, Novel [ʒ] = 1). Condition was weighted effect coded with
15 two levels (Control = 1, Experimental = −0.75). Participants’ mean word endorsement rates are
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 35
3 (both [s] and [ʒ] pronunciations) across the two conditions used in the analysis of generalizing
4 /z/-devoicing.
6 The model intercept indicates that there is an overall bias towards endorsing items as
7 words (β = 1.04, CrI = [0.47, 1.63], Pr(β > 0) = 1). There is strong evidence that novel words
8 pronounced with [s] are endorsed as words (β = 1.16, CrI = [0.59, 1.76], Pr(β > 0) = 1), but little
9 to no evidence that this interacts with Condition (β = 0.13, CrI = [−0.28, 0.56], Pr(β < 0) = 0.73).
10 That is, listeners in the experimental condition did not generalize their learning of /z/-devoicing
11 to novel /z/ words pronounced with [s]. Overall, listeners were less likely to endorse Heard (β =
12 −1.74 , CrI = [−2.35, −1.14], Pr(β < 0) = 1) and Novel (β = −2.23 , CrI = [−2.82, −1.68], Pr(β <
13 0) = 1) items where /z/ was pronounced as [ʒ] as words. The evidence that this interacted with
14 Condition is weak for Novel [ʒ] items (β = 0.20, CrI = [−0.18, 0.59], Pr(β < 0) = 0.85) and non-
15 existent for Heard [ʒ] items (β = 0.06, CrI = [−0.42, 0.56], Pr(β > 0) = 0.61). These results are
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 36
3 represent 95% CrI and thick lines represent 50% CrI. The posterior mean estimate for each
4 parameter is indicated by the vertical tick mark.
6 4.3. Discussion
7 Regardless of condition assignment, listeners were very likely to identify /z/ words with
8 devoiced [s] pronunciations as words. Listeners in the experimental condition who were exposed
9 to devoiced /z/ in training were more likely to endorse heard /z/ words with devoicing as words,
10 indicating that they had adjusted their thresholds for acceptable or identifiable realizations of /z/
11 in a directional manner for the items they were exposed to. However, there was no evidence for
12 generalization for listeners in the experimental group: while listeners in the experimental
13 condition were more likely to identify previously heard devoiced /z/ words as words, there was
14 no evidence that novel /z/ words pronounced with [s] were more likely to be identified as words.
15 This outcome highlights the potentially word-specific nature of perceptual adaptation.
16 In the generalization model, there was weak evidence that control listeners were more
17 likely to endorse novel /z/ words with [ʒ] pronunciations as words than experimental listeners,
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 37
1 suggesting not only that experimental condition listeners used a directional adaptation
2 mechanism to adjust their /z/ category, but also that control listeners exposed to multiple novel
3 pronunciations at test may have relaxed their criteria for /z/ in novel words across the course of
4 the test phase, as they were, for the first time, exposed to this talker producing /z/ as [s] and then
5 [ʒ]. This suggests that while listeners did not make any general category relaxation for /z/ in the
6 context of lexical items they heard as [z] in the exposure phase, there is weak evidence that /z/
7 category boundaries were slightly relaxed to include [ʒ]-like pronunciations for novel lexical
8 items. When listeners had not previously been presented with counter-evidence for specific
9 lexical items, control listeners show a tendency towards category relaxation in the test phase.
10 This pair of outcomes indicates that the same underlying category can be subjected to different
11 mechanisms depending on the nature of the variation in the input. Simply, the nature of the input
12 triggers the adaptation mechanism.
13 Note that there was moderate evidence that listeners exposed to devoiced-/z/
14 pronunciations in the exposure phase were less accurate on the categorization of filler words.
15 This is a small (well below a doubling of odds) but consistent effect, and may be due to an
16 apparent difference in the word-nonword balance across conditions; Experimental participants
17 have learned to perceive target items (which are part of the nonword count in the stimuli
18 distribution) as words, they identify fewer filler words as words. An alternative possibility is that
19 by virtue of learning that a talker makes certain pronunciation changes, listeners may anticipate
20 additional pronunciation changes which render licit words as nonwords. Both of these
21 interpretations are speculative and warrant future consideration, and stem from a small effect.
22 In summary, as expected, both listener groups were likely to call devoiced /z/ items
23 words, as they are all exposed to such pronunciations in their natural input. Listeners who were
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 38
1 exclusively presented with devoiced /z/ in the exposure phase were even more likely to identify
2 these items as words. Their adaptations were limited to the specific items they were exposed to
3 and in the direction of variation to which they were exposed. That is, /z/-devoicing was not
4 extended to novel /z/ items that were not presented in the exposure sentences and
5 alveopalatalized [ʒ] pronunciations of /z/ were not more likely to be identified as words. This
6 lack of generalization was unexpected, and we discuss this further in the general discussion.
7 5. Experiment 3: Learning /s/-voicing
8 Experiment 2 established that listeners adjust their lexical decision thresholds to a talker’s
9 /z/-devoicing pattern for items they were exposed to, albeit in a somewhat narrow manner. In
10 Experiment 3 we tested whether listeners learned an /s/-voicing pattern, which is both
11 typologically marked and very likely outside of listeners’ regular perceptual experience in
12 English, as demonstrated by Experiment 1. The materials and procedures for Experiment 3 are
13 equivalent to those for Experiment 2, with the exception that critical items were underlyingly /s/
14 words, and listeners were exposed to /s/-voicing instead of /z/-devoicing. To assess whether any
15 adjustments were due to a directional adaptation or a general relaxation mechanism, items with
16 [ʃ] were included in the second half of the test block.
17 5.1. Methods
18 5.1.1. Materials
19 Like in Experiment 2, the stimuli for the exposure phase in Experiment 3 comprised 56
20 semantically coherent filler sentences, randomly sampled from a pool of 100 filler sentences, and
21 two versions of the 14 semantically predictable critical sentences. The control conditions had
22 sentence-final critical words produced in their canonical form (e.g., cassette [kəˈsɛt]). In the
23 experimental /s/-voicing condition, the sibilant in the critical /s/ word was produced as [z] (e.g.,
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 39
1 cassette [kəˈzɛt]). The test stimuli for the lexical decision task consisted of the 14 critical /s/
2 words heard during exposure (half with [ʃ] in place of [z]), 14 novel /s/ words (half with [ʃ] in
3 place of [z]; randomly sampled by participant from a list of 22 possible novel words), 42
4 nonwords (phonotactically-legal maximal pseudowords randomly sampled by participant from a
5 pool of 110 nonwords), and 70 filler words (randomly sampled by participant from a pool of 103
6 filler words). Again, the large number of filler words serves to bias listeners to respond to the
7 voiced /s/ items as nonwords. The full list of items is presented in the Appendix.
8 Like for the /z/ items, lexical frequency (log frequency per million) of the final stimuli
9 list were estimated using the SUBTLEX-us corpus (Brysbaert & New, 2009). The /s/ items used
10 in exposure (M = 1.93, SD = 0.61) were matched in frequency with the novel items (M = 2.03,
11 SD = 0.59; Welch’s t(27.25) = −0.48, p = 0.63) that were used in the lexical decision test. A list
12 of the critical sentences and lexical items from the lexical decision task are shown in the
13 Appendix. The lexical frequency of the items used in Experiment 2 (/z/-devoicing) and
14 Experiment 3 (/s/-voicing) did not differ significantly from one another (Welch’s t(69.27) =
15 −0.83, p = 0.41).
16 5.1.2. Procedure
17 The procedure for Experiment 3 was identical to that of Experiment 2.
18 5.1.3. Participants
19 There were 135 adult participants from the Metro Vancouver community in Experiment
20 3. Using the same criteria as in Section 4.1.3., participants were excluded if they were not self-
21 reported native speakers of English (n = 34), had a speech or hearing impairment or did not
22 answer the question (n = 7), or scored below 90% on filler words (n = 7). There were 87
23 participants retained in the analysis (Control: n = 46, Experimental: n = 41). Participants varied
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 40
1 in gender (64 female, 16 male, 1 fluid, 1 non-binary, 4 did not report), and of the participants
2 who reported their age (n = 84), the majority were undergraduate student-aged (M = 21.08 , Mdn
3 = 20, SD = 3.90). Participants self-identified with various racial and ethnic backgrounds (White
4 = 31, Chinese = 20, South Asian = 8, Filipino = 3, Southeast Asian = 3, Other/Mixed = 22), and
5 typically had knowledge of multiple languages (M = 3.86, SD = 1.32), including English.
6 Participants were compensated with partial course credit or $10 CAD.
7 5.2. Analysis and Results
8 The analysis for Experiment 3 was nearly identical to that of Experiment 2. Less than
9 0.2% of the data was removed due to reaction time filtering. The models for Experiment 3 have
10 the same formula, weak priors, and specifications as described in Section 4.2. For reference, the
11 formula was: Word Endorsement ~ Item Type × Condition + (1 + Item Type | Participant) + (1 |
12 Word).
13 5.2.1. Model: Learning /s/-voicing
14 This model assesses whether or not participants learned /s/-voicing, and excludes critical
15 test items that were not heard during exposure. In the model, Item Type was weighted effect
16 coded with four levels (Item Type Filler: Filler Word = 1 , [z] = 0, [ʃ] = 0, Nonword = −1.69;
17 Item Type Heard [z]: Filler = 0, [z] = 1, [ʃ] = 0, Nonword = −0.16; Item Type Heard [ʃ]: Filler =
18 0, [z] = 0, [ʃ] = 1, Nonword = −0.16). Condition was weighted effect coded with two levels
19 (Control = 1, Experimental = −1.12). Mean word endorsement rates are summarized by Item
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 41
3 critical items across the two conditions used in the analysis of learning /s/-voicing.
5 In the model of learning /s/-voicing, the intercept indicates that there is an overall bias
6 towards endorsing items as words (β = 1.79, CrI = [1.41 , 2.20], Pr(β > 0) = 1), though there was
7 little to no evidence of a meaningful difference across conditions (β = 0.09, CrI = [−0.12, 0.31],
8 Pr(β > 0) = 0.80). There is strong evidence that filler words were consistently endorsed as words
9 (β = 4.13, CrI = [3.77, 4.52], Pr(β > 0) = 1), and that this interacted with Condition. Control
10 participants were slightly more likely to endorse filler words as words (β = 0.32 , CrI = [0.16,
11 0.49], Pr(β > 0) = 1), suggesting that listeners in the Experimental group may have globally
12 adjusted their criteria for word endorsement, becoming more conservative with respect to what
13 constitutes a word, as in Experiment 2. There is weak evidence that Heard [z] items were less
14 likely to be endorsed as words (β = −0.64, CrI = [−1.76, 0.47], Pr(β < 0) = 0.87), and
15 furthermore, the Condition × Item Type [z] parameter indicates that Control participants were
16 less likely to endorse Heard [z] items as words (β = −0.57 , CrI = [−1.27, 0.10], Pr(β < 0) =
17 0.95). This provides some evidence that listeners in the Experimental group adjusted their /s/
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 42
1 criteria to accommodate [z] pronunciations. There is strong evidence that [ʃ] items were less
2 likely to be endorsed as words overall (β = −3.38 , CrI = [−4.76, −2.06], Pr(β < 0) = 1).
3 Additionally, Control participants were less likely to identify [ʃ] items as words (β = −0.51 , CrI
4 = [−1.43, 0.40], Pr(β < 0) = 0.87), though given the probability of the effect’s direction, this
5 should be interpreted as weak evidence that Experimental participants generally relaxed their
6 word endorsement thresholds. The population-level parameters for the model of learning /s/-
11 95% CrI and thick lines represent 50% CrI. The posterior mean estimate for each parameter is
12 indicated by the vertical tick mark.
14 5.2.2. Model: Generalizing /s/-voicing
15 This model addresses the question of whether participants generalized their learning of
16 /s/-voicing to novel words — those not heard during exposure. As in Section 4.2.2, Filler Words
17 and Nonwords were excluded, while all Heard and Novel critical items were retained. The same
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 43
1 model structure was used. Item Type was weighted effect coded with four levels (Item Type
2 Novel [z]: Heard [z] = −0.99, Novel [z] = 1, Heard [ʃ] = 0, Novel [ʃ] = 0; Item Type Heard [ʃ]:
3 Heard [z] = −0.99, Novel [z] = 0, Heard [ʃ] =1 , Novel [ʃ] = 0; Item Type Novel [ʃ]: Heard [z] =
4 −1.01, Novel [z] = 0, Heard [ʃ] = 0, Novel [ʃ] = 1). Condition was weighted effect coded with
5 two levels (Control = 1, Experimental = −1.14). Participants’ mean word endorsement rates are
10 and [ʃ] pronunciations) across the two conditions used in the analysis of generalizing /s/-voicing.
12 In the model of generalizing /s/-voicing, there is a slight overall bias to call items
13 nonwords (β = −0.87 , CrI = [−1.75, −0.04], Pr(β < 0) = 0.98), unlike each of the previous three
14 models. Overall, there was some moderate evidence that novel /s/ items pronounced with [z] are
15 more likely to be endorsed as words (β = 0.32, CrI = [−0.19, 0.84], Pr(β > 0) = 0.90), and strong
16 evidence that [ʃ] pronunciations for /s/ items are less likely to be endorsed as words, whether
17 Heard (β = −0.95, CrI = [−1.55, −0.41], Pr(β < 0) = 1) or Novel (β = −1.16 , CrI = [−1.80,
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 44
1 −0.56], Pr(β < 0) = 1). There is moderate evidence that Control participants are less likely to
2 endorse items as words across the board (β = −0.57 , CrI = [−1.30, 0.17], Pr(β < 0) = 0.94),
3 suggesting that Experimental participants may have generally relaxed their criteria for /s/ which
4 manifests here as greater acceptance of [ʃ] pronunciations. There was no evidence that Condition
5 interacted with Item Type, as each interaction term substantially overlaps with zero, possibly
6 because the pattern is well-captured by the main effect of Condition. The population-level
11 represent 95% CrI and thick lines represent 50% CrI. The posterior mean estimate for each
12 parameter is indicated by the vertical tick mark.
14 5.4. Discussion
15 Listeners were assigned to an experimental condition where /s/ words were produced
16 with [z] — a voiced fricative at the same place of articulation — or to a control condition where
17 a typical [s] was heard in the same sentence set. At test, all listeners were presented with /s/ items
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 45
1 from exposure containing /s/-voicing, novel /s/ words with voicing, heard /s/ words pronounced
2 with [ʃ], and novel /s/ words with [ʃ]. Bayesian multilevel logistic regression models present very
3 weak evidence that listeners exposed to voiced /s/ adapted their /s/ category to specifically
4 accommodate these pronunciations. That is, there is little to no evidence of a directional
5 adjustment mechanism in play in response to exposure to /s/-voicing. However, there is weak-
6 to-moderate evidence that, at test, listeners exposed to the voiced /s/ in exposure were more
7 likely to call any non-canonical pronunciation of an /s/ word a word than listeners in the control
8 condition, suggesting that any change in /s/ category structure was the result of a more general
9 relaxation of /s/ criteria, as opposed to any directional adjustments towards voiced /s/.
10 6. General Discussion
11 Our goal was to examine asymmetries in adaptation to non-canonical pronunciations,
12 focusing on the voicing patterns of coronal fricatives, given the typological and English-specific
13 tendencies for these fricatives to devoice as opposed to voice. In Experiment 1, we first
14 confirmed that North American English speakers in the Buckeye Corpus produce substantially
15 more (categorical) /z/-devoicing than /s/-voicing in spontaneous speech. Such a confirmation
16 reinforces an expected asymmetry that is reflected in the behavioural data of Experiments 2 and
17 3: we expected listeners to adjust their word endorsement behaviours in different ways to /z/-
18 devoicing and /s/-voicing. The devoicing of /z/ is not only typologically frequent and
19 phonetically natural, but also comparatively frequent in spontaneous speech in North American
20 English. Categorical voicing of /s/, on the other hand, is typologically rare, phonetically
21 unnatural, and very rare in spontaneous North American English. In Experiments 2 and 3, we
22 presented listeners with naturally-produced words containing coronal fricatives that had been
23 produced with either devoicing (/z/ → [s]) or voicing (/s/ → [z]) — compared to their canonical
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 46
1 citation forms — in sentences. Groups of listeners in control conditions were presented with the
2 same sentences and words with their typical fricative realizations (/z/→ [z]; /s/ → [s]). We tested
3 whether listeners in the Experimental conditions adjusted their fricative categories, identifying
4 more items with a change in coronal fricative voicing as words in a lexical decision test. To
5 assess whether adjustments are targeted in the direction of the exposed variant or whether such
6 adjustments are the results of general category relaxation, the test block also presented listeners
7 with an additional change in place of articulation. In the latter part of the test phase, listeners
8 were presented with items where an expected /z/ was replaced by [ʒ] and /s/ by [ʃ].
9 The Bayesian statistical analysis provides nuance in evaluating the evidence for
10 directional adaptation and general relaxation mechanisms in perceptual learning. While listeners
11 in both the control and experimental conditions of Experiment 2 (/z/-devoicing) showed strong
12 evidence of identifying devoiced /z/ items as words, those in the experimental condition were
13 more likely to identify these items as words, demonstrating directional adaptation. These same
14 listeners, however, did not generalize their adjustments to novel devoiced /z/ items, underscoring
15 just how lexically-specific the adjustments were, though both listener groups did identify these
16 items as words at high rates, which is expected given it is a pronunciation pattern listeners have
17 substantial experience with. Listeners in the /z/-devoicing control condition (Experiment 2) were
18 more likely than those in the experimental condition to accept [ʒ] pronunciations as words,
19 suggesting that exposure to novel pronunciations at test, after having been presented with
20 canonical /z/ pronunciations in exposure, may have triggered a general category relaxation
21 mechanism at that point. It is worth reiterating that the evidence for this behaviour in the control
22 condition was weak, an did not extend to previously heard /z/ words pronounced as [ʒ] at test.
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 47
1 The behaviours in Experiment 3 (/s/-voicing) were quite different. While the evidence
2 was weak and weak-to-moderate, respectively in the learning and generalization models,
3 experimental condition listeners who were exposed to voiced /s/ were more likely to identify [z]
4 and [ʃ] pronunciations as words compared to control listeners. In the generalization model, this
5 was an across-the-board increase in word endorsement rates, applying to all items, heard or
6 novel. This suggests that exposure to an atypical pronunciation during exposure may trigger a
7 generalizable and more general category relaxation strategy, compared to the directional and
8 non-generalized adjustments observed for participants exposed to /z/-devoicing. These
9 complementary results suggest that targeted adaptation and category relaxation are not
10 necessarily mutually exclusive mechanisms, but rather are triggered in response to the stimuli.
11 Crucially, experimenters must acknowledge that test stimuli are indeed more exposure to the
13 respect to our hypotheses, which were all based on predictions about the behaviour of the
14 experimental group. Note that in mapping these summaries to our analyses, all of the Bayesian
15 models assess the evidence for general relaxation, while only the second models for each
16 experiment assess the evidence for generalization to novel words. While the results of these
17 experiments offer insight into adaptation processes for listeners in the control conditions as well,

2 The goal of these experiments was to take advantage of English phonology and fricative
3 typology as a way to establish that there are predictable asymmetries in lexically-guided
4 perceptual learning in speech, compared to asymmetries which have simply been fortuitously
5 stumbled upon (e.g., Zhang & Samuel, 2014). We predicted that adjustments to /z/-devoicing
6 would be different from those for /s/-voicing for two very different reasons.
7 The first reason supporting the learnability of devoiced /z/ stems from the voiced
8 fricative’s typological rarity. Voiced fricatives are typologically less common than voiceless
9 fricatives across the languages of the world. Producing a voiced fricative involves an
10 aerodynamic configuration that maintains the subglottal and supraglottal pressure differential for
11 voicing whilst generating high enough pressure behind the constriction to create turbulent
12 airflow. Voiced fricatives often devoice or become approximants in languages (i.e.,
13 debuccalization). Thus, the argument can be made that voiceless fricatives are more natural than
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 49
1 voiced fricatives, and that listeners may be more likely to learn this more natural pattern. Indeed,
2 in the learning of phonological patterns, there is some evidence that learners appear to be biased
3 towards learning what is phonetically natural (though disentangling naturalness is a challenge;
4 Martin and Peperkamp, 2020). Wilson (2006) develops “substantively biased phonology”, where
5 phonological learners have knowledge of their phonetic apparatus, and this biases them towards
6 phonological patterns that are phonetically natural. The influence of this bias is not so strong as
7 to prevent unnatural sound patterns from emerging through sound changes, but rather accounts
8 for listeners’ preference for phonetically natural patterns. Note that these phonological biases are
9 studied in artificial language learning paradigms that lack lexical scaffolding to facilitate the
10 interpretation of noncanonical input. Comparisons between what is learnable in an artificial
11 language learning task and what is learnable in an adaptation task are thus imperfect, but still
12 valuable.
13 The observation of English listeners being more experienced with /z/-devoicing than /s/-
14 voicing is our second reason for expecting /z/-devoicing to be learned more readily than /s/-
15 voicing. It is well established that /z/ devoices in both lab speech (Docherty, 1992; Veatch, 1989;
16 Stevens et al., 1992; Smith, 1997) and spontaneous speech across varieties of English.
17 Experiment 1 echoes this prior work, in that we find evidence of /z/-devoicing and a lack of
18 evidence for frequent /s/-voicing in conversational speech with data from the Buckeye Corpus.
19 Why might these synchronic patterns of variation affect the nature of perceptual adaptation? Let
20 us consider the proposed mechanisms that support perceptual learning in the first place.
21 Perceptual learning is a retuning of sublexical representations, which means that the
22 nature of those representations is of crucial importance for these theories. The two leading
23 models — TRACE (McClelland & Elman, 1986; McClelland, Mirman, & Holt, 2006) and
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 50
1 Merge-B (Norris et al., 2000; Norris et al., 2016) — disagree about where that retuning takes
2 place. The current study does not arbitrate between these models, but instead offers insight into
3 other aspects of the adaptation process, and is thus applicable to both models. The
4 multidimensional phonetic distribution of sublexical /z/ likely includes devoicing, given its
5 frequency in our corpus analysis. On the other hand, the sublexical representation of /s/ likely
6 does not include any instances of voicing based on listeners’ prior experiences with their
7 language. Simply, the sublexical representations reflect listeners’ prior experiences with speech
8 sounds, and mechanisms supporting lexically-guided perceptual adaptation appear to be a means
9 by which these are updated. So, the fact that listeners regularly experience devoiced /z/ in their
10 natural ambient input and not voiced /s/ can account for the fact that the /z/ control group of
11 Experiment 2 had a high rate of devoiced /z/ endorsement, while the /s/ control group of
12 Experiment 3’s endorsement of voiced /s/ items was lower. But, why does experience hearing
13 devoiced /z/ in the exposure phrase boost word endorsement of the exposed items at test for the
14 /z/ group, but the group exposed to voiced /s/ shows no evidence of directional word-specific
15 learning? Why does the /s/-voicing group exhibit evidence of global /s/ category relaxation
16 instead?
17 Recent work by Tzeng, Theodore, and Nygaard (2021) clearly demonstrates — using /s/-
18 /ʃ/ recalibration — that phonemic adjustments represent a cumulative experience update. Given
19 this, we expect that /s/-voicing would be learnable. Kraljic, Samuel, and Brennan (2008) argue
20 that learning can be blocked when listeners can attribute the deviant pronunciation to an
21 incidental speech trait, as opposed to a characteristic one. Kraljic and Samuel (2011) revise this
22 reasoning, and instead appeal to episodic models of speech perception: listeners learn that
23 incidental ambiguous pronunciations are perceptual experiences that update episodes associated
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 51
1 with particular experiences, such as talking with a pen in one’s mouth. They argue that different
2 representations are updated according to different experiences. In our case, with the lack of
3 robust directional learning of voiced /s/, it does not seem likely that listeners would have treated
4 these as unique or distinct episodes (as in Kraljic and Samuel, 2011), given that they heard
5 multiple instances of voiced /s/ and no counter-evidence to the pattern in the exposure phase.
6 Additionally, while the artificial language learning work discussed above indicates that more
7 natural patterns are more easily learned, listeners are still fully capable of learning unnatural
8 patterns. While it is possible that listeners in the /s/-voicing condition (Experiment 3) did not
9 show targeted directional learning because the pronunciation pattern was deemed an incidental
10 speech trait, following the logic of Kraljic et al. (2008), we offer an alternative explanation that
11 exists within the sound change literature.
12 A mechanism that may account for the current results exists more readily in theories
13 about sound change, which could be viewed as the long game in accommodating new sound
14 patterns. Several recent models intended to account for diachronic sound change all highlight a
15 need for mechanisms that filter or discard ambiguous items (Wedel, 2006; Sóskuthy, 2015; Hay,
16 Pierrehumbert, Walker, & LaShell, 2015; Todd et al., 2019). Sóskuthy (2015), for example,
17 introduces an ambiguity filter to his computational model of perception-production feedback as a
18 means of accounting for the simultaneous stability and flexibility of sound systems. An item
19 experienced by an agent may be discarded if it is phonetically ambiguous. In Sóskuthy’s model,
20 like many other episodically-flavoured models (e.g., Pierrehumbert, 2002, 2003; Johnson, 1997),
21 an update to a category shifts the category to accommodate the newly experienced item into its
22 distribution. Highly frequent words have denser distributions and are thus less affected by new
23 experiences, while low frequency words will be more easily swayed by novel pronunciations.
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 52
1 Sóskuthy describes this in terms of phonetic ambiguity. Hay et al. (2015), on the other hand,
2 propose a mechanism with a similar function that operates more on the word level. Hay and
3 colleagues examine the front vowel push chain in New Zealand English using corpus data that
4 span 130 years. They propose a mechanism similar to the feel of Sóskuthy’s ambiguity filter: if
5 items are “difficult to understand, they will be less likely to be encoded in memory” (Hay et al.,
6 2015: 88). In their work, the crucial example relates to high frequency and low frequency words
7 at a category boundary. Low frequency words of the encroached upon category will then be more
8 readily comprehended and encoded when they are more acoustic-phonetically distant from the
9 original category. Along similar lines, a computational model of sound change by Todd,
10 Pierrehumbert, and Hay (2019) implements an exemplar-based model that includes evaluation
11 stages for discriminability and typicality prior to a storage stage, which contributes to the
12 modelling of frequency effects in sound change.
13 A post-perceptual evaluative stage similar to those proposed by sound change theorists
14 may account for the directional adaptation to devoiced /z/, which did not generalize, compared to
15 the very different category relaxation behaviour, which included generalization to novel items,
16 for voiced /s/. Such a mechanism is congruent with our results, and the prospect of integrating
17 theoretical mechanisms for category flexibility and stability in both synchronic and diachronic
18 scenarios is appealing. When listening to devoiced /z/ items in sentences, listeners likely had no
19 trouble recognizing the intended word and it was likely not considered an extreme outlier, as
20 listeners regularly experience devoiced /z/. Thus, these devoiced /z/ items were filed away and
21 used to update the /z/ distribution for particular lexical items only. This suggests that listeners
22 may have been explicitly learning an alternate pronunciation of particular lexical items (similar
23 to the dual mapping described in Samuel & Larraza, 2015), which in the context of our results
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 53
1 did not influence the entire /z/ distribution. While we did not test lexical endorsement for
2 canonical pronunciations, there is no reason to believe that listeners would reject such items
3 (e.g., listeners would likely accept both [dʌsən] and [dʌzən] for dozen, regardless of condition).
4 Listeners presented with sentences that include items with voiced /s/ likely comprehended the
5 utterances as intended. However, given the rarity of experience with voiced /s/, these items may
6 not have passed an ambiguity filter threshold, despite recognition in context. As a result, these
7 items may not have directly updated the distribution, but instead affected the threshold of what
8 may constitute an /s/. These listeners seemed to be more willing to accept any novel
9 pronunciation as /s/ compared to control listeners, as evidenced by the interaction between
10 condition by item types in the /s/-learning model, and the main effect of condition in the /s/-
11 generalization model.
12 This kind of post-perceptual evaluation is becoming viewed as necessary to account for
13 diachronic sound change — and offers an elegant account of our results — but how does it fit
14 with the models and mechanisms discussed above for lexically-guided perceptual learning? A
15 stage that involves weighting of evidence and goodness-of-fit evaluation seems to align well
16 within a Bayesian model like Merge B (that has a more explicit decision stage built into the
17 model framework), though an evaluation stage is not incompatible with an interactive model of
18 spoken language processing (e.g., TRACE). Building such a stage into our models allows us to
19 account for asymmetries in adaptation that ostensibly relate to the magnitude of experienced
20 category deviation. While we remain agnostic between the two opposing proposals, the degree to
21 which lexical activation feeds back or merges with a phonemic category to allow a sufficient
22 signal-to-phoneme mapping update may be determined by the certainty or confidence in the
23 lexical assessment and deviant sound’s category goodness (Babel, McAuliffe, et al., 2019).
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 54
1 Ultimately, the current results demonstrate that subphonemic changes with which listeners have
2 linguistic experience facilitate targeted adjustments in the direction of that experience, while
3 novel changes seem to spur a more general relaxation of criteria for the category.
4 The total lack of generalization to novel devoiced-/z/ words warrants further discussion.
5 We suggest that this is due to listeners learning a context-specific mapping associated with a
6 particular lexical item. Previous studies highlighting a lack of generalization argue that the
7 learned acoustic-auditory features are highly context dependent (Reinisch, Wozny, Mitterer, and
8 Holt, 2014; Reinisch and Mitterer, 2016). The context dependency is surprising, given that
9 perceptual recalibration is typically assessed with the assumption of generalized learning, as the
10 categorization continua typically used to quantify learning employs novel lexical items or non-
11 words to localize a category boundary shift. Generalization is a hallmark of robust learning and
12 is found in a range of instances in perceptual retuning: for example, within a voice across word
13 position (Eisner et al., 2014) and oral stop places of articulation (Kraljic and Samuel, 2006), in
14 addition to across sufficiently auditorily similar voices (Kraljic and Samuel, 2007; Reinisch and
15 Holt, 2014). The targeted and specific behaviour for devoiced-/z/ merits further investigation,
16 and while the present result is not entirely without precedent, it highlights that generalization
17 should not necessarily be the default assumption.
18 7. Conclusion
19 We demonstrate that there are asymmetries in what listeners learn and how they adjust in
20 lexically-guided perceptual learning tasks. Listeners adapted to word-specific patterns in /z/-
21 devoicing, illustrating a directional adaptation mechanism. Those exposed to voiced /s/ showed
22 some evidence of engaging in more generic /s/ category relaxation, subtly and variably
23 increasing their probability of endorsing any novel /s/ pronunciation. These results suggest that
ASYMMETRIES IN PERCEPTUAL ADJUSTMENTS 55
1 perceptual learning of speech is moderated by listener knowledge or experience. The different
2 response elicited by these two patterns may be because /z/-devoicing is phonetically natural in
3 the languages of the world and/or because it taps into pre-existing pronunciation variants and is,
4 therefore, readily recognized and accepted as a pronunciation that merits the updating of a
5 word’s category-associated distribution. We are, of course, unable to say which of these phonetic
6 factors is ultimately the motivating factor for the lack of learnability of voiced /s/ and the
7 learnability of devoiced /z/, but we clearly establish an important asymmetry in how listeners
8 update phonetic representations. We posit that an evaluation stage, which has been invoked in
9 the sound change literature, accounts for these results. Altogether, these results suggest that
10 adaptation to novel pronunciation may leverage distinct mechanisms based on the nature of the
11 phonetic variability presented.
