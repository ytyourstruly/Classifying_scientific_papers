Abstract
It has been suggested by some authors that time has no physical existence, but it would be an
illusion. The human being uses clocks for measuring the numerical sequential order of the
duration of material changes, namely the motion which runs in space. We experience a run of
changes in the frame of the linear psychological time “past-present-future”, which has its
basis in the neurological activity of the brain. We could link it with a concept of universe
where there is neither physical past nor physical future. In this model of “time-free” space (in
the physical sense) it exists only what we observe with our senses and measure with
apparatuses.
