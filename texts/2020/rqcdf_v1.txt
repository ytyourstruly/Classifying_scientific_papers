21 Abstract. Social information is immensely valuable. Yet we waste it. The information we get
22 from observing other humans and from communicating with them is a cheap and reliable
23 informational resource. It is considered the backbone of human cultural evolution. Theories and
24 models focused on the evolution of social learning show the great adaptive benefits of evolving
25 cognitive tools to process it. In spite of this, human adults in the experimental literature use
26 social information quite inefficiently: they do not take it sufficiently into account. A
27 comprehensive review of the literature on five experimental tasks documented 45 studies
28 showing social information waste, and 4 studies showing social information being over-used.
29 These studies cover “egocentric discounting” phenomena as studied by social psychology, but
30 also include experimental social learning studies. Social information waste means that human
31 adults fail to give social information its optimal weight. Both proximal explanations and
32 accounts derived from evolutionary theory leave crucial aspects of the phenomenon unaccounted
33 for: egocentric discounting is a pervasive effect that no single unifying explanation fully
34 captures. Cultural evolutionary theory’s insistence on the power and benefits of social influence
35 is to be balanced against this phenomenon.

41 1. Introduction
43 The human capacity to use social information is fundamental to our species’ cultural evolution—
44 arguably humankind’s key adaptive asset [1–4]. It affords enormous cognitive benefits, allowing
45 individuals to avoid the costs of individual exploration, and most importantly, to avail
46 themselves of collective progresses no individual could have made on their own. One is naturally
47 tempted to infer that humans evolved both uncommon capacities for using social information,
48 and an uncommon degree of dependence on it. Leading specialists of cultural evolution embrace
49 this view, drawing on alleged cases of over-reliance on the example of others, such as the
50 imitation of kamikaze suicides [5] or celebrity suicides [4,6], and the copying of prestigious
51 models in domains where these models are clearly incompetent [7]. However, several
52 experimental results, including from the cultural evolution research tradition, suggest that
53 individuals (this paper focuses on human adults) use social information sub-optimally.
54 Specifically, they do not use it enough.
56 Social information consists in all the things that an individual can learn from others, be it through
57 intentional communication, demonstrations, or the mere observation of behaviours that are not
58 necessarily meant to be seen [1,8]. We use social information whenever we let it affect our
59 behaviour. Alongside social information, we routinely process large amounts of non-social
60 information. Here we'll call it "individual": primary perceptions that come to us directly from the
61 world, neither coming from nor mediated by other people. Individual information has one clear
62 advantage over social information: it comes to us processed by no filter but our own sensory
63 nervous system. Social information is processed or produced by others before we process it,
64 which can cause distortions due to random error, bias, or deliberate deception.
66 In a social world, individual information acquires two new uses.
68 First, each agent’s individual information can be combined with others agents’ individual
69 information, producing “wisdom of crowds” effects. When several agents produce two
70 independent (i.e., not influenced by or copied from the other agent) guesses on a state of the
71 world, and if (for binary decisions) each individual agent is more likely to be right than wrong,
72 the combination of their guesses through majority voting or averaging usually gives a far more
73 reliable guess than any single answer [9–11]. This well-known result only holds, however, to the
74 extent that individual guesses are independent from each other: each guess must reflect
75 individual information [12,13].
77 Second, possessing a piece of information that is not (or not yet) social may give one an edge in
78 strategic relations with conspecifics. Disclosed to others, it enhances one's reputation as a
79 reliable informant and valuable cooperator [14]. Kept to oneself, it makes it possible to reap
80 rewards that elude others [15]. Both types of information (the social and the asocial) thus have
81 their advantages and drawbacks. How much weight should we give to individual or social
82 information, and how much effort should we spend acquiring one or the other?
84 Experimental evidence from several independent research traditions has evidenced a surprising
85 discrepancy between efficiency rules for social information use, and human participants’ actual
86 behaviour. Contrary to what one might expect from a cultural species, participants appear to put
87 too little weight on the information they can gather from other people’s decisions or testimony.
88 In each of the literatures we survey, the relevant findings are relatively uncontroversial: we do
89 not claim to be discovering anything that is not already known. However, researchers in one field
90 do not necessarily know about all the findings from other fields. As a result, the pervasiveness of
91 egocentric discounting is not always fully realised. Furthermore, no single field possesses an
92 integrated account of why it occurs in its multiple manifestations. The present paper precisely
93 aims at filling this lacuna, proceeding in three steps. Part 2 synthetises the available experimental
94 evidence for the overweighting of individual information relative to social information,
95 surveying social psychology, cultural evolution, and experimental economics. In Part 3, we
96 discuss the putative proximate factors that have been put forward to explain this effect: cognitive
97 biases, task-specific demands, biases in participants sampling. In Part 4, we discuss some
98 ultimate factors that one can derive from theories or models about social learning’s evolutionary
99 history. In conclusion (part 5), our survey reveals that no single explanation taken in isolation
100 captures all the aspects of the phenomenon.
102 2. How much does social information weigh in our decisions?
104 The supplementary materials present a list of publications that specifically document how
105 experimental participants (focusing exclusively on human adults) give less weight to social
106 information when it conflicts with a belief that they hold based on previous knowledge, or with a
107 piece of private information provided by the experimenters to them but not to others. A
108 comprehensive list of inclusion criteria is given in Section 1 of the Supplementary Materials.
109 These are studies in which participants are asked to perform a task, having access to both
110 individual and social information. Pieces of information of both kinds are potentially relevant to
111 the task, but often conflict. What counts as success in the task is clearly defined, and there are
112 widely accepted normative frameworks that specify how agents should behave to succeed.
113 Accurate performance, as opposed to agreement with other participants, is valued (usually
114 incentivised). The participants are presented with social information, usually concerning the
115 other participants’ responses, freely or at a small cost.
117 The exact criteria for what constitutes rational or efficient use of social information vary
118 depending on authors, protocols, or studies, but some basic criteria are shared by all. First, the
119 opinion of two random participants should be given equal weights. Second, absent suspicions of
120 deceptive intent or noisy transmission, other people’s opinion should not be given less weight
121 merely because they come from others. These two principles imply that the average random
122 participant should give equal weight to her opinion and to that of a random participant from the
123 same group [16]. This basic principle can be formalised in various ways, the most common being
124 Bayesian updating rules [17–22] or the averaging heuristic [16,23]. This point of view is not
125 universally shared. Hawthorne-Madell and Goodman [24] defend a somewhat more relaxed view
126 of what counts as a rational use of social information. Their model does not place a priori
127 restrictions on the degree of competence that an agent should attribute to a random unknown
128 agent. If an agent believes themselves to be more knowledgeable and reliable than others, it is
129 rational for them to discount others’ opinions. Indeed, under this assumption, the very fact that
130 others disagree with the agent is evidence that their advice shouldn’t be trusted [24]. This model,
131 however, does not explain why an agent would believe themselves to be better informed and
132 more reliable than any random agent, on a topic that neither agent is especially competent about.
134 We did a comprehensive search of the literature on five experimental tasks, detailed below.
135 Overall, between 45 (counting only clear cases) and 49 (counting ambiguous cases, see Supp.
136 Mat. Section 1 on what counts as a ambiguous case) of the studies we collected show that
137 participants clearly fail to give enough weight to social information, showing excessive reliance
138 on their own information, a phenomenon known as “egocentric discounting” in the advice-taking
139 literature [25]. We re-use this label, here, to name a phenomenon that goes far beyond advice-
140 taking experiments. In contrast, we found only 3 publications (5 if we include two ambiguous
141 cases) showing a bias in the other direction or an absence of bias. This review is no quantitative
142 proof, but it is in line with the consensus view in the publications we surveyed (See
143 supplementary materials, in particular section 1 on inclusion criteria). Evidence for egocentric
144 discounting, which consists in giving individual information greater weight than would be
145 normatively warranted, comes from at least three independent research traditions (social
146 psychology, cultural evolution-inspired experiments, and behavioural economics). In all three,
147 egocentric discounting came up as a surprise discovery—at least not one that previous theorising
148 had predicted. These studies mainly use five broad types of tasks.
150 The advice-taking paradigm. The standard form of this task is the “Judge-Advisor System” [26],
151 but we also consider studies that do not use this exact paradigm, or do not explicitly do so, as
152 well as studies from the forecast combination literature [27,28]. In a typical advice-taking task,
153 the participant is asked to make a quantitative judgement on a factual question (e.g. “What is the
154 height of Mount Everest?”). Having given this first answer, they are confronted with another
155 participant’s answer, and allowed to give a second answer. Accurate answers are usually (but not
156 always) incentivized (incentives tend to decrease the egocentric discounting effect without
157 eliminating it) [29]. The main variants involve presenting the participant with the other estimate
158 before asking them for their own, presenting the participant with an average of the group’s
159 estimate, or allowing discussions between participants. The normative strategy in such tasks, for
160 the second answer, is to average, i.e., to move halfway towards the other participant’s guess [28],
161 unless one has reasons to think the advisor is clearly more (or less) knowledgeable than oneself.
162 All the studies we gathered find evidence of egocentric discounting, at least in their baseline
163 condition: the participants’ second guess modifies their first guess in the direction of the
164 advisor’s guess, but gives much more weight to the participant’s first guess than to the advisor’s.
166 measures) for 40 experiments across 17 publications. All 40 studies document a WOA below
167 0.5, consistent with egocentric discounting, in one condition at least (usually the baseline
168 condition). Egocentric discounting can be modulated by changing the participants’ confidence in
169 their own answer and their perception of the advisor’s expertise, but all this happens against a
170 baseline of heavy discounting.
172 Two-armed bandit problems with social learning. In a typical task, a participant must choose
173 between two options, A and B, one of which yields greater rewards on average. The payoff
174 function linking A or B to the attached rewards is noisy, so that the best response can only be
175 detected after a certain amount of exploration. Participants are typically informed about their
176 rewards on each trial, with a piece of individual (and usually, private) information, but they are
177 also informed about other participants’ choices. This information may concern one participant, a
178 few, or all previous participants, it may or may not include the feedback that these participants
179 received, it may or may not be available for free. Given this variation, there is not one single
180 optimal strategy for taking social information into account in all these tasks, and even inside a
181 given task, what would constitute optimal use cannot always be straightforwardly determined.
182 Nevertheless, six studies show clear cases of egocentric discounting (vs. only one showing clear
183 evidence of the opposite effect). In [30]’s “Best Color” condition, the option that gave the best
184 payoff for the majority of participants on the previous round is announced, yet the model that
185 best fits the data does not include social information. In [31], participants in the “social learning”
186 condition are not given any individual feedback on their own responses, but they are told what
187 the majority of participants chose in another condition, where those participants were given
188 feedback. This information is under-used, resulting in sub-optimal choices. (Specifically, 12 out
189 of 40 participants, self-described non-conformists, ignore it altogether.) In [32] (experiment 2),
190 participants sometimes or (for 20 participants out of 55) always refuse to view a piece of
191 information about others’ choices that is made freely available and would have improved
192 decisions if followed. In experiment 3 of the same study, a conformist strategy (imitating what
193 the majority of participants did on the previous rounds) is consistently optimal but not
194 consistently followed by participants, who tend to prefer relying on their own private
195 information. Importantly, learning based on non-social information is, in these studies, highly
196 effective (e.g. [31]). In other words, participants have no difficulty updating their behaviour
197 when the feedback consists in individual (rather than social) information. This suggests that
198 general difficulties with belief updating cannot explain social information under-use in these
199 tasks.
201 “Virtual arrowheads” experiments. These experiments, developed by Mesoudi and his group
202 (e.g. [33,34]) can be seen as a many-dimensional version of a multi-armed bandit task.
203 Participants devise, via a computer interface, arrowheads that are used for simulated “hunts”, and
204 rewarded depending on their hunts’ success. Hunting success is a function of the arrowhead’s
205 properties (a range of parameters that participants determine). Although [35] found that
206 participants readily consulted and used social information when given the opportunity to view
207 the choices of other players for free, requiring participants to pay for this information clearly
208 pushes them to rely on their own feedback instead. In subsequent studies where participants must
209 choose between getting feedback on their own hunts and seeing other people’s choices of
210 arrowhead parameters, they choose the former, even though choosing the latter is more
211 beneficial [33,34,36].
213 In the last two types of tasks, a participant must guess a given state of the world on the basis of
214 cues provided by the experimenter, and may be given, in addition to these cues, information on
215 other participants’ choices (one or more). This general description fits both the use of cue-based
216 learning paradigms in the advice-taking and social learning literatures [37–40], and the “ball-
217 and-urn” task used by behavioural economists to simulate cascades (e.g. [17], and see sup. mat.).
218 In addition to the cues, participants may be given feedback regarding the accuracy of their
219 choices, but in “ball-and-urn” studies, no feedback is given until rewards are disclosed at the end
220 of the task.
222 Cue-based learning. These studies, inspired by advice-taking tasks, differ from advice-taking
223 tasks in one essential respect. Instead of basing their guesses on general knowledge, the subjects
224 have access to a series of experimentally controlled cues. The subject makes a first guess on the
225 basis of these cues, then makes a second (possibly revised) guess after being exposed to social
226 information (either an expert’s guess, or a peer’s guess, or a group’s average guess). Once again,
227 participants fail to update their first guess as much as they should [37–39]. Here again we only
228 looked for positive evidence for egocentric discounting, or for the opposite effect. We do not
229 include studies whose design may have allowed them to capture egocentric discounting, but
230 which do not mention it among their findings, possibly because they did not look for it. Possible
231 examples include [40,41].
233 Ball-and-urn tasks. In a typical ball-and-urn task (see sup. mat. for more information),the
234 experiment starts with the experimenter randomly picking one out of two urns. Each urn contains
235 balls of different colours, one urn having more balls of colour A, the other urn more balls of
236 colour B. Participants, playing one after the other, are each given a ball drawn (with
237 replacement) from the chosen urn. They must guess which of the two urns is being used,
238 knowing that one urn contains more balls of colour A, the other more balls of colour B. (The
239 ratio of A/B balls in each urn is typically known to the participants.) In addition to seeing the
240 colour of their own ball (individual information), each participant knows the guesses made by
241 everyone else before them. The studies in this group are the least straightforward to interpret,
242 because of issues surrounding the normative criteria that apply to the task. To determine the
243 weight that a participant should give to the decisions of the preceding participants, assumptions
244 need to be made regarding their rationality, the probability that they err randomly, and the weight
245 that they themselves put on their predecessors’ decisions. Standard models, based on rational
246 choice (in the specific sense of Bayesian updating) and game-theoretic equilibria [42,43], assume
247 that all agents update their beliefs in a fully normative way, and know that other agents also do.
248 Yet experimental participants do not behave in the normative way, as these models make clearly
249 false predictions [43,44]. Since standard models are normatively valid for an agent only if other
250 agents behave as the model say they should, which they do not, using them as a normative
251 benchmark is questionable. Several alternative ways to prove egocentric discounting coexist in
252 the literature. One consists in showing that a simple “private information” model, where
253 participants take no account whatsoever of social information and only rely on their individual
254 information, outperforms more complex model like the Bayes-Nash model [45–47]. Another is
255 to demonstrate that participants overweigh their private information both relative to the optimal
256 Bayes-Nash model but also relative to more realistic models, like the Quantal Response
257 Equilibrium model [48]. Perhaps the most concrete demonstration comes from showing how
258 much of the possible payoff participants forego by relying on private information (an important
259 amount, while almost no payoff is lost from following social information) [44,49]. Together,
260 these different lines of circumstantial evidence converge to show that participants in these tasks
261 generally underuse social information.
264 3. Proximate explanations for egocentric discounting
266 Many potential explanations have been put forward to explain egocentric discounting [3,29,50].
267 A generally endorsed explanation is that people put less trust in socially acquired information
268 than in individual information [29,51]. This explanation is not trivial. It does exclude some
269 possible causes, for instance a general inability to revise one’s opinions in the face of
270 information of whatever nature. There is a general consensus that egocentric discounting is
271 different from, and stronger than, a simple inability to update our beliefs [27,29]. Belief updating
272 in human adults is not optimal, but consistent evidence for a clear bias in favour of one’s prior
273 opinion is lacking [52]. In most of the “bandit” and “arrowhead” tasks, participants get private
274 feedback on their actions, which they take into account in a near-optimal way, contrasting with
275 their poor use of social information [31,53]. Likewise, participants in advice-taking tasks use
276 new evidence efficiently when it is not social [16,22]. Self-confidence is a reliable predictor of
277 egocentric discounting [29]: indeed, as Hawthorne-Madell & Goodman show, it is rational (in
278 the authors’ specific sense) for a self-confident agent to discount divergent opinions. However,
279 simply saying that people fail to place as much trust in other informants as they place in
280 themselves eschews the main question. Why do we not trust others as much as we ought to?
282 Lack of ecological validity. The value of social information may be higher in experiments than it
283 is in real life. According to a common critique of the experimental psychology of decision-
284 making, subjects tackle laboratory tasks with a series of heuristics adapted to real-life
285 circumstances that need not obtain in the lab, leading to a mere appearance of irrationality [54].
286 Is there evidence that people fail to profit from social information optimally outside the lab?
287 Non-laboratory evidence that people fail to trust social information as much as would be useful
288 for them includes studies of vaccine refusal, climate change skepticism, and resistance to mass
289 persuasion attempts (synthesised in [55]). The experiments reviewed here represent a wide range
290 of methodologies, some highly controlled, others much closer to everyday experience. Among
291 the most ecologically relevant, the early experiments on forecast updating grew from ergonomic
292 research [37,56,57] What these studies ask of their subjects is little different from what they
293 would do in the ordinary course of their life: update an epidemiological forecast or a medical
294 treatment forecast, based on another opinion. Experiments in the advice-taking literature also
295 place subjects in a fairly ordinary situation, that of updating one's estimate for a date (e.g. a
296 historical or news event), a quantity (e.g., a price), given someone else's estimate. It is not clear
297 how these tasks depart from ordinary situations in such a systematic way as to explain pervasive
298 egocentric discounting.
300 Culture. One popular explanation among cultural evolutionists explains egocentric discounting
301 as an effect of culturally inculcated individualistic values [1,36,58]. Individualistic cultural
302 learning is thought to be a “Western” phenomenon, absent in some cultures at least: China, Japan
303 or Korea [1,59], or small-scale societies relying on pastoralism (according to [58]). However,
304 clear evidence for egocentric discounting has been found in both groups. Egocentric discounting
305 was documented in Japanese [60,61] and Chinese participants [20,36,62], and in a group of
306 executives from 24 different nationalities [28]. While some studies find stronger rates of
307 egocentric discounting in East Asian participants as opposed to Western ones [61], others do not
308 [20,60]. In [36], only one sample of East Asian participants shows higher reliance on social
309 learning, but the other two do not. Pastoralists in [58] show less discounting of social
310 information compared to horticulturalists or city-dwellers, but they still discount it, as do the
311 Altiplano pastoralists studied in [30]. Overall, the literature shows some evidence for cultural
312 modulations of egocentric discounting, but does not support seeing it as a Western peculiarity.
313 Geographical differences may also be determined by external factors (rather than culturally
314 transmitted ideologies). For instance, experiencing economic and psychosocial adversity seems
315 to increase reliance on social information [63].
317 Access to reasons. One standard explanation in the advice-taking literature holds that participants
318 trust their own views more because they have access to their reasons for those views [16,64].
319 There are, however, reasons to doubt that this is a necessary condition. Results show that
320 egocentric discounting occurs even when participants are asked to revise an estimate without
321 being given access to the cues that motivated the estimate [65] and that egocentric discounting is
322 also observed when participants are presented with someone else’s opinion, falsely presented as
323 their own [27,66]: they put more weight than they ought to on opinions that are presented as their
324 own.
326 Task engagement. In most of the studies we reviewed, participants may be more actively
327 involved in processing or producing individual information, than in receiving advice. Active
328 engagement in a task promotes learning in a way that passive observation does not, arousing the
329 participants’ attention to a greater extent and allowing them to encode information in distinctive
330 ways [67]. In “two-armed bandit” and “arrowheads” tasks, the level of engagement is often
331 strikingly higher for individual information: the nature of the feedback that participants receive is
332 a direct consequence of their intentional actions, whereas social information is produced by
333 others. In some of these tasks, participants may decide whether or not they want to see others’
334 choices, but the extent of their active involvement with social information ends there. In most
335 advice-taking tasks, the participants actively generate their personal estimate, and are then
336 passively exposed to someone else’s. Could this explain egocentric discounting in such cases?
337 Partly, but once again it fails to explain why egocentric discounting obtains when participants are
338 presented with someone else’s opinion falsely presented as their own [27,66]. The best argument
339 against an account of egocentric discounting based on the participants’ active involvement may
340 come from ball-and-urn tasks, where both individual and social information consist in passively
341 received cues. Social information remains discounted. It is worth noting, however, that in
342 experiments where social information has to be actively requested, instead of being passively
343 presented, subjects are prone to request too much social information [68,69], even when that
344 information is worthless [70].
346 An anchoring effect in advice-taking tasks. These tasks typically ask a participant to formulate
347 their own guess for a quantitative or numerical question, then to update it after being exposed to
348 someone else’s guess. These are favourable conditions for an anchoring effect to occur.
349 Anchoring effects happen when a piece of information biases an estimate because all subsequent
350 estimates are referred to it and weighed in its direction, to a greater extent than they should be,
351 and even when the piece of information is completely irrelevant — for instance, a random
352 number [71]. In one sense, egocentric discounting truly is a type of anchoring effect: the
353 participants’ initial estimate is given excessive weight, preventing them from updating their
354 guess as much as they should. However, there are good reasons to reject the view that the general
355 mechanisms at work in the anchoring effect explain egocentric discounting [27,29,65,72]. One
356 reason is that an egocentric effect still obtains when participants complete a number of unrelated
357 numerical estimation tasks between their first estimate and their last estimate, which should
358 cancel any priming effect [27]. Furthermore, telling participants that an estimate is their own is
359 sufficient to trigger egocentric discounting in favour of that estimate, even when the estimate is
360 not actually their own, and is presented for the first time [27,66]. If egocentric discounting rested
361 on a mere anchoring effect, labelling estimates as one’s own or others should not matter. See
362 [73] for an exploration of the possible role of anchoring mechanisms in advice-taking more
363 generally.
365 Low exploration rates in “bandit” and “arrowhead” tasks. In these two types of tasks,
366 participants must update their behaviour in response to feedback, in a simulated environment
367 where the payoff associated with each response is noisy, and may change over time. In some of
368 these experiments, environmental changes are faster than in habitual real-life situations. A failure
369 to adjust to the rapid rates of these changes could lead to conservatism, i.e., a tendency to stick to
370 the solution one chose on previous trials (or remain close to it) instead of changing to the
371 (correct) solution available with social learning. Two studies show a correlation between
372 exploratory behaviour and social learning. In the "social and individual learning condition" of
373 [34] (Experiment 2), changes in the up-coming responses were greater for participants who opted
374 to copy a model than for those who did not. In [74] participants in the "social learning"
375 condition, who could see the solutions that other participants gave to the task, were more
376 explorative than participants in the individual learning condition, who could not. The data in [34]
377 in particular raise the possibility that participants neglected social information because of a
378 general aversion to exploration (in [74], it is not clear whether participants under-use social
379 information). However, neither study establishes causation. In [74], the availability of social
380 information is experimentally manipulated and controlled, so high exploration must be a
381 consequence of social learning—not its cause. Another study that experimentally manipulates the
382 availability of social information, and finds that social information induces a greater level of
383 exploration, is [50]. Here again, greater explorativeness cannot cause social learning. Both
384 studies suggest that relations between exploration and social learning, when present, are likely to
385 reflect an effect of social information upon exploratory behaviours, rather than the opposite. (See
386 [75] for additional evidence against a causal link between exploratory behaviour and social
387 information use).
390 4. Evolutionary explanations for egocentric discounting
392 The mechanisms discussed in the previous sections have to do with the specifics of experimental
393 situations, from participant selection to task demands. We now move on to possible explanations
394 for egocentric discounting that see it as a functional and adaptive feature of the way we deal with
395 social information.
397 Epistemic vigilance. Trouche et al. [66] interpret egocentric discounting through the lens of
398 Sperber et al.’s epistemic vigilance framework [76]. In this view, human adults have an a priori
399 reluctance to believe communicated information, unless accompanied by arguments or other
400 guarantees of reliability. This default vigilance serves as a protection against attempted
401 manipulation [76]. A straightforward implication seems to be that social information will be less
402 readily accepted when a source intentionally communicates it, rather than letting it leak
403 inadvertently. Yet, it is unclear whether participants in the experiments we just reviewed usually
404 perceive social information as being intentionally communicated to them by the source. With a
405 few exceptions [77], social information is merely introduced as another participant’s opinion,
406 leaving it unspecified whether the participant intended their opinion to be shown, or even knew
407 that it would be. The same is true of most two-armed bandit tasks, arrowhead experiments, and
408 cue-based learning tasks: social information is eavesdropped by its recipient, not openly
409 communicated by its source. The major exception are “ball-and-urn” experiments, where
410 participants know that their answers will be made public to all subsequent participants [17,44].
411 Contrary to what epistemic vigilance might imply, this seems to cause participants to trust social
412 information more, not less. Participants in ball-and-urn tasks tend to answer in ways that are
413 helpful for others (but possibly harmful for themselves). Working with a task similar in its main
414 features to the ball-and-urn tasks, [78] argue that participants are aware of this, and show that
415 participants are more likely to follow their predecessor’s advice than to imitate their action—the
416 opposite of what epistemic vigilance would suggest. This piece of counter-evidence is merely
417 suggestive: testing the epistemic vigilance hypothesis would require experiments that make it
418 clear to participants whether other participants intentionally produced social information for
419 other participants to use.
421 A producer-scrounger dilemma for information use. Social information is only useful when
422 others also gather information asocially. Cultural-evolutionary models contain a possible
423 explanation of egocentric discounting. Rogers’ influential model [79] showed that social learning
424 may not provide any advantage over individual learning when the environment changes. The
425 advantage of using social learning depends on the frequency of social learners in the population:
426 if those are too numerous, social learning is useless. When there are mostly individual learners,
427 copying is effective, because it saves the costs of individual exploration, and because the
428 probability of copying a correct behaviour is high. However, when there are mostly social
429 learners, the risk of copying an outdated behaviour increases and individual learners are
430 advantaged. This means the advantages of social-learning are inversely frequency-dependent: the
431 more other people learn socially, the less efficient it is to learn from them. The same logic is
432 reflected, on a smaller scale, in models of information cascades, where social learning can (with
433 a small probability) become detrimental for an individual when too many other individuals resort
434 to it. More generally, a broad range of models converge upon the view that social information
435 use can be likened, in terms of evolutionary game theory, to a producer-scrounger dynamic
436 [35,75,80]. At equilibrium, these games typically yield a mixed population of producers
437 (individual learners) and scroungers (social learners), where neither type does better than the
438 other [81,82]. Egocentric discounting might emerge from a producer-scrounger dilemma, as a
439 response to the devaluation of social information which may occur when too many other agents
440 rely on social learning.
442 This hypothesis potentially explains several phenomena related to egocentric discounting. A
443 frequency-dependent equilibrium could account for egocentric discounting in a subset of
444 experimental participants [83]. These participants could be wasting social information for two
445 reasons, a strategic one and an altruistic one. The strategic reason starts from the premise that
446 other participants rely excessively on social learning, making it hazardous to follow them. On a
447 more altruistic account, egocentric discounting may be a way to help the community of
448 participants with first-hand information [50]. Egocentric discounting, in this perspective, is
449 altruistic: it increases the amount of information circulating in a group, at the cost of making the
450 discounter less accurate [42]. Only two studies, to our knowledge, address the possible effect of
451 altruistic motivations on egocentric discounting. In Eriksson & Strimling [50], subjects who
452 scored high on a prosocial attitudes survey (Social Value Orientation scale) showed a greater
453 propensity to acquire individual as distinct from social information, although [69] fails to find an
454 impact of self-reported altruistic tendencies on subjects’ preferences for social or private
455 information. A "producer-scrounger equilibrium" account may also explain the widely
456 documented inter-individual heterogeneity in propensities for social learning [53,75,84,85] since
457 such an equilibrium is based upon the coexistence of two opposite strategies. However, this
458 account leaves several questions unanswered, which future work might address.
460 - How do we explain egocentric discounting at the aggregate level? The experiments we review
461 document egocentric discounting effects at the level of entire groups of subjects. Even though
462 inter-individual variation, when explored, can be large, the discarding of social information is not
463 driven by a minority, and it is not compensated, overall, by an equally strong tendency in the
464 opposite direction. Why are there so few information scroungers?
466 - Do egocentric discounters expect others to over-rely on social information, and why? The
467 producer-scrounger dilemma account appears to assume that people waste social information
468 because they assume (consciously or not) that others are too reliant on it, making it less useful.
469 But in most of the studies we reviewed the opposite holds true: most participants rely too little on
470 social information, not too much.
473 5. Conclusion
475 There is little doubt that our species relies a great deal on social information, and that cultural
476 transmission would be impossible if we did not use it [7,76,86]. This makes the well-known
477 phenomenon of egocentric discounting all the more puzzling. This paper documented it across
478 five different experimental paradigms (going beyond standard cases of egocentric discounting in
479 the advice-taking literature). Several independent research traditions uncovered different aspects
480 of the same phenomenon, a phenomenon that none of them had predicted. Combining the results
481 of a diverse range of tasks allows for a better assessment of the most common explanations. Our
482 review highlights the difficulty of explaining away egocentric discounting with any single-cause
483 account, and stresses the need to study egocentric discounting through the lenses of the multiple
484 research traditions that have investigated it. Those complement each other. Social psychology is
485 strong on ecological validity. Cultural evolution research seeks diverse subject pools of
486 participants. Experimental economics is weaker on both these counts, but cascade experiments
487 provides evidence against mechanisms that play a role in other paradigms: for instance, task
488 engagement or epistemic vigilance.
490 A closer look at egocentric discounting also addresses a long-running debate in cultural
491 evolutionary theory. A long-standing critical argument rightly stresses the artificial nature of the
492 distinction between social and individual learning [87,88]. Social learning, as the critics point
493 out, need not be anything but individual learning from social cues: humans require no special-
494 purpose adaptation, no dedicated cognitive module to learn from others. We fully agree with this
495 stance, with one subtle difference. Individual and social information may be processed by the
496 same mechanisms, but not on an equal footing. The information that one gets on one’s own
497 engages our attention differently; it is more tractable and traceable than information that comes
498 to us filtered through others’ minds. Because it is acquired independently, it is also of more use
499 to others than second-hand information.
501 Cultural evolution, alongside social psychology and experimental economics, has done much to
502 document and explore the fact that socially acquired information may be given less weight than
503 equivalent individual information. No extant theory predicts this phenomenon in all its
504 dimensions or in a straightforward way. An exciting next step could consist in drawing the
505 cultural consequences of our reluctance to incorporate information: how it impacted the
506 evolution of social learning in our evolutionary past, and the diffusion of culture throughout our
507 history.

27 1. Inclusion criteria
29 This document summarizes a comprehensive search of three literatures—social psychology,
30 cultural evolution, and experimental economics. We looked specifically for empirical studies
31 of social learning where human adult participants could access information from other human
32 adults. (We include Gardner & Berry’s 1995 study, where advice comes from a computer
33 expert system because it is historically important and highly influential.) Studies of social
34 learning in non-human animals or in children do not fall under the purview of this review.
35 The non-human literature is too vast for a single paper to tackle it alongside the human
36 literature. The developmental literature on social learning is more directly relevant but we
37 believe the expertise gap between children and the adults they interact with is so broad as to
38 cancel any specific effect of egocentric discounting (Mascaro et al., 2017). (But see Atkinson
39 et al., 2020 for an example of social learning in children, where egocentric discounting is not
40 observed.)
42 Since we needed reliable criteria against which to measure the efficient use of social
43 information, we excluded tasks where the task lacks a straightforward normative solution. In
44 other words, we focus on tasks where participants must make a guess (or a bet) concerning a
45 state of affairs that is independent not only of their own opinion, but also of other
46 participants’ views. This excludes the vast literature on persuasion and attitude change, where
47 participants are exposed to arguments concerning policy interventions (e.g., Should abortion
48 be legal?) or matters of taste (e.g., Which colour do you prefer?). For similar reasons, we also
49 excluded studies where the nature of the rational response depends on other people’s
50 responses, as happens in most economic games (e.g. Prisoner’s dilemmas). For similar
51 reasons, we excluded studies where “normative conformity” (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955), i.e.,
52 the pressure to give a response in conformity with other participants’ responses for reasons of
53 social desirability, was likely to play an important role: this explains the absence of Asch’s
54 famous experiment (Asch, 1955) and its various replications. We also excluded tasks based
55 on strategic interactions (e.g., public goods game, ultimatum game, etc.), where aligning with
56 others’ actions may be beneficial or detrimental in itself, neither option being intrinsically
57 “right” or “wrong” (e.g., Molleman & Gächter, 2018).
59 The various fields studying social learning use a wide variety of methods and measurement
60 tools. There is no such thing as a unified metric for egocentric discounting, which the five
61 families of studies covered here would share. The closest thing to such a metric is the “weight
62 of advice” measure used in Judge-Advisor-System tasks (although WOA-like measures come
64 whenever possible, to get a systematic and quantitative overview. For other studies, however,
65 we rely on verbal descriptions, since the methods and measurements used are not
66 commensurable. For all clear cases of egocentric discounting, we rely on the authors’
67 interpretation, in their own words. When the evidence is less clear-cut we explain how we
68 interpret the study.
70 The following survey distinguishes two categories of evidence: ambiguous and non-
71 ambiguous. We count evidence is ambiguous if there are good reasons to doubt the effect as
72 interpreted by the authors, or if we suspect the existence of an effect but the authors do not
73 explicitly make this claim.
75 2. Advice-taking tasks
77 We include in this category all the studies that we found where a participant was asked to
78 produce her individual answer to a numerical or quantitative question, then, having made this
79 first guess, was confronted with that of another participant (real or fictitious), or (in rare
80 variants) several participants. This survey mostly brought back studies from the literature on
81 advice-taking, usually carried out with the Judge-Advisor System paradigm, as well as
82 forecast combination tasks. We also include studies like (De Filippis et al., 2016; Morgan et
83 al., 2012, Experiment 2; Toelch et al., 2014, Heath & Gonzalez 1995) that do not derive from
84 the advice-taking research traditions, but that use a highly similar task, with analogous results.
85 Several studies measuring the “wisdom of crowds” effect provide relevant data because they
86 measure participants’ propensity to revise their opinion when exposed to a group’s average
87 guess (Jayles et al., 2017; Kerckhove et al., 2016). Lastly, two studies using an original
88 methodology are Heath & Gonzalez (1995), where exposure to the advisor’s advice is
89 replaced with live interactions, and Gardner & Berry, who use an idiosyncratic set-up (see
90 description below).
92 Our goal here is simply to show the pervasiveness of egocentric discounting and its
93 importance. Bonaccio & Dalal’s authoritative review (Bonaccio & Dalal, 2006) provide a
94 comprehensive overview of the various factors that modulate egocentric discounting, not
95 covered in this supplementary material.

98 2.1. Advice-taking studies, reporting the weight of advice (or a related measure) (17
99 publications)
101 We include here all the studies we could find that measure egocentric discounting with a
102 reported “Weight of Advice”. When a participant updates her estimate in response to another
103 participant’s estimate, the rational strategy (other things being equal) is to use a WOA of 0.5,
104 i.e., to move halfway towards the other participant’s estimate. A WOA significantly below 0.5
105 is evidence of egocentric discounting. Most studies using the Judge-Advisor System report a
106 “Weight of Advice” measure to assess egocentric discounting. All the studies that report this
108 control or baseline condition (i.e., subject’s first guess > advisor’s guess > subject’s second
109 guess) coupled with a test condition (e.g., modulating the difficulty of the task) designed to
110 decrease egocentric discounting and increase the WOA, often successfully. Without a single
111 exception, all studies find a WOA below 0.5, consistent with egocentric discounting, in at
112 least one condition (the baseline, usually). We provide standard deviations and number of
113 subjects when available.

139 2.2. Advice-taking studies, not reporting the weight of advice (or using other measures)
141 This list gathers all the relevant studies that did not report a raw weight of advice (or similar)
142 measure, but described relevant effects either qualitatively or quantitatively through a
143 different measure. We only mention positive evidence for egocentric discounting or for the
144 opposite effect. We did not include studies whose design may have allowed them to capture
145 egocentric discounting, but which do not mention it among their findings, because they did
146 not look for it. Possible examples include two studies by Sniezek and co-authors (Sniezek &
147 Buckley, 1995; Sniezek & Van Swol, 2001).
149 2.2.1. Evidence of Egocentric Discounting (12 publications)
151 Chacoma & Zanette (2015), one unique experiment. “The most frequent instance recorded
152 in the experiment corresponds to no change in the answers (...)—in agreement with a
153 comparable result in the original version of the experiment. In almost 60% of the events, the
154 subjects chose not to modify their answers, while their confidence remained the same in more
155 than 70%.” (p. 13)1
157 De Filippis et al. (2016), one unique experiment. “Our main result is that subjects update on
158 their private signal in an asymmetric way. They weigh the private signal as a Bayesian agent
1 This quote, like all other quotes in this document, describe the study’s relevant result (as
opposed to generalities or results of other studies).
159 would do when the signal con...rms their prior belief; they overweight the signal when it
160 contradicts their prior belief.” (p. 1)
162 Harvey & Harries (2004), experiment 2 of 2. "[In Experiment 2]... people combining
163 forecasts put more weight on forecasts that are their own (whether or not they are labelled as
164 such) or are labelled as their own (when they are not) than on equivalent forecasts that are
165 neither their own nor labelled as such." (p. 391) Note: Experiment 1 deals with forecasts
166 combination, not directly with Egocentric Discounting.
168 Heath & Gonzalez (1995), Experiments 1–2 of 3. "[These] two studies show that interaction
169 [with other participants] does not increase decision accuracy. (...) According to the studies in
170 this paper, it appears that interaction is relatively ineffective as information collection.
171 Decision quality does not improve much after interaction." (p. 305). Note: Experiment 3
172 focuses on rationalization as distinct from decision-making.
174 Kerckhove et al. (2016), one unique experiment. “Most individuals overweight their own
175 opinion compared to the mean opinion to revise their judgment … in accordance with the
176 related literature on the subject. (p. 4)
178 Lim & O’Connor (1995), all 3 experiments. “The studies reported in this paper examine the
179 efficacy of allowing people to adjust their own forecasts in the light of statistical forecasts that
180 are provided to them. (…) … people had considerable difficulty placing less weight on their
181 own forecasts (compared to the statistical forecasts) and this behaviour became more
182 pronounced over time. Even provision of decision support did not improve performance at the
183 task.” (p. 149)
185 Mahmoodi et al. (2015), Experiment 1 of 4. [In Experiment 1] “When collapsed across dyad
186 members, participants showed a small egocentric bias, confirming their partner’s decision in
187 45 ± 16% (mean ± SD) of disagreement trials. This result is consistent with previous works
188 on egocentric advice discounting.” (p. 2) Note: The next experiments (2 to 4) do not address
189 egocentric discounting.
191 Mannes (2009), Experiments 2-4 of 4. “[In Experiment 2] participants improved upon their
192 initial judgments but were conservative in their use of advice— increases in influence
193 declined at a faster rate than recommended by an ego-neutral judgment policy. Accordingly,
194 their observed policies failed to weight appropriately the more accurate and reliable
195 judgments.” (p. 1272) “[In Experiment 3] because ... participants placed too much weight on
196 their initial beliefs, they underperformed the ego-neutral judgment policies.” (p. 1274) “[In
197 Experiment 4] participants continued to underperform the ego-neutral judgment policies.” (p.
198 1276) Note: Experiment 1 does not ask participants to combine or confront their own estimate
199 with that of a group.
201 Minson et al. (2011), all 4 experiments. “[In the four studies] dyad members failed to give
202 due weight to a partner’s estimates” (p. 1325)
204 Morgan et al. (2012), Experiment 2 of 4. “The rarity of conditions under which conformist
205 behaviour is realized suggests a bias towards asocial over social information.” (p. 660)
207 Moussaïd et al. (2013), Experiment 2 of 2. “… participants exhibited a significant bias
208 toward their own initial opinion rather than equally weighting all social information they were
209 exposed to” (p. 6) Note: Experiment 1 addresses only individual performance.
211 Toelch et al. (2014), one unique experiment. "We show that individuals behave near Bayes
212 optimal when integrating two distinct sources of social information but systematically deviate
213 from Bayes optimal choice when integrating individual with social information… In general,
214 models confirmed that players underused social information when integrating social and
215 individual information." (p. 1746)
217 Yaniv & Choshen-Hillel (2012), all 3 experiments. “In three studies, participants used
218 others’ opinions to estimate uncertain quantities (the caloric value of foods). In the full-view
219 condition, participants could form independent estimates prior to receiving others’ opinions,
220 whereas participants in the blindfold condition could not form prior opinions. (…) In all
221 studies, the blindfolded participants provided more accurate estimates than did the full-view
222 participants. (…) … the advantage of the blindfolded participants was due to their unbiased
223 weighting of others’ opinions.” (p. 427)
225 2.2.2. Ambiguous evidence of Egocentric Discounting in an atypical task (1 publication)
227 Gardner & Berry (1995), Experiments 1 and 2 of 3. Note: This study does not follow the
228 judge-advisor paradigm, and it is atypical in two respects. Subjects received advice from a
229 computer “expert system” instead of a human advisor, and they had numerous occasions to
230 make decisions based on this advice and based on the feedback they received. In the
231 “Optional Advice” condition of experiment 1, subjects may use that is accurate and improves
232 performance, if used. Yet it is ignored 40% of the time (p. S64–S65). This phenomenon is
233 again observed in experiment 2, where the advice is explained verbally. Experiment 3 does
234 not directly address egocentric discounting.
236 2.2.3. Ambiguous evidence for the opposite effect (2 publications)
238 Leong & Zaki (2018), all 2 experiments. Note: In this study, participants rely excessively
239 on the advice of two virtual characters, which are misleadingly (in our view) presented as
240 experts. In experiment 1, the three characters in this simulated financial decision task are
241 presented as “financial advisors”, suggesting relevant expertise, even though only one makes
242 predictions more accurate than chance. In experiment 2, one crucial advisor receives above-
243 average ratings even though his performance is no better than chance. (Removing this
244 misleading cues of competence cancels the effect.)
246 Schultze et al. (2017), all 4 experiments. Note: Participants follow an advisor’s opinion
247 even when they have no reason to do so, because the advisor’s estimate is preposterously off
248 the mark, or because they know the advisor is a random numbers generator. This reversal of
249 egocentric discounting relies entirely on an anchoring effect (see below on anchoring effects
250 as potential explanations for egocentric discounting). The authors present their effect as
251 compatible with egocentric discounting, which they see as a distinct mechanism.
253 3. “Multi-armed bandit” tasks
255 The experiments included here allow participants to choose between different bets (typically
256 two) to obtain different payoffs. Some bets are associated with higher payoffs, but the
257 relationship is noisy. Social information comes in the form of exposure to other participants’
258 bets, possibly accompanied by their payoffs. Performance is incentivized as a rule, in contrast
259 to the Judge-Advisor System literature where rewards often fail to follow performance. This
260 list only mentions positive evidence for egocentric discounting or for the opposite effect. We
261 did not include studies whose design may have allowed them to capture egocentric
262 discounting, but which do not mention it among their findings, possibly because they did not
263 look for it. A possible example includes McElreath et al. (2005).
265 3.1. Evidence of Egocentric Discounting (6 publications)
267 Efferson et al. (2008), one unique experiment. “A subset of social learners behaved
268 according to a classic model of conformity. The remaining social learners did not respond to
269 frequency information.” (p. 56)
271 Efferson et al. (2007), one unique experiment. “The analysis ... found neither a clear
272 tendency to imitate success nor conformity. Players instead seemed to rely largely on private
273 feedback about their own personal histories of choices and payoffs.” (p. 11)
275 Eriksson & Strimling (2009), Experiment 1 of 2. “We found that people explore a smaller
276 number of further options after having individually acquired information about three options,
277 compared to when they had socially acquired the same information. This result supports our
278 hypothesis that individually acquired information has greater cognitive impact than socially
279 acquired information.” (p. 10) Note: Experiment 2 does not directly address the importance of
280 egocentric discounting but considers how personality traits may affect it.
282 Najar et al. (2019), all two experiments. "The comparison of the private reward learning
283 rate with the imitation learning rate was overall consistent with an egocentric bias." (p. 2)
285 Toelch et al. (2014), Experiment 1 of 2. [In Experiment 2, the “Farming game”] “… there
286 was considerable individual variation in the use of this social information in planting
287 decisions, and for many participants the observed social information had little influence on
288 their planting decisions.” (p. 4) Note: egocentric discounting was not clearly reported for the
289 first experiment, a perceptual discrimination task with social input.
291 Toyokawa et al. (2019), one unique experiment. "… the social learning weight[‘s]…
292 estimated mean value was 𝜎̄ = 0.3. This implies a weaker social than asocial influence on
293 decision-making as reported in several other experimental studies (…). Thanks to this
294 relatively weak reliance of social learning, the kind of herding that would have blindly led a
295 group to any option regardless of its quality (like the ‘symmetry breaking’ known in social
296 insect collective foraging systems…) did not occur."
298 3.2. Ambiguous evidence of Egocentric Discounting (3 publications)
300 Glowacki & Molleman (2017), Experiments 1–2 of 3 experiments (one study with 3
301 different populations). Note: At least two of the three groups of participants (the urban
302 dwellers and the pastoralists) fail to request social information most of the time. Social
303 information consists in the last decision of three other players, and thus it is likely to be at
304 least as useful as information regarding a participant’s own decision.
306 McElreath et al. (2005), Experiments 2–3 of 3. Note: In experiment 2, participants can
307 access, for free, information on the behaviour of another (randomly picked) participant (but
308 not their payoff). 20 out of 55 participants never or rarely used this information. Social
309 learning was higher in experiment 3, where participants could access the whole group’s
310 choices. (Social learning was impossible in experiment 1, a purely individual task.)
312 Toyokawa et al. (2017), one unique experiment. Two-thirds of the participants make no use
313 at all of the information they are given concerning the choices of another player. However, it
314 is unclear whether using this information would be beneficial at all.
316 3.3. Evidence for the opposite effect (1 publication)
318 Yahosseini et al., 2018), one unique experiment. "The harmful effect of social information
319 is caused by the participants’ tendency to copy social information too early in the experiment,
320 without knowing its relative value compared to what can be discovered by individual
321 exploration." (p. 5)
323 4. “Virtual arrowheads” tasks
325 These experiments simulate the manufacture of arrow blades and its evolution in a virtual
326 environment. Participants are asked to specify several characteristics of their arrowheads,
327 each combination of characteristics being associated with a (noisy) payoff. The task can be
328 seen as a many-dimensional version of a multi-armed bandit task. Performance is
329 systematically incentivized. Social information comes as information concerning the other
330 participants’ arrowhead designs, possibly accompanied by the associated payoffs.
332 This list only addresses positive evidence for egocentric discounting or for the opposite effect.
333 We did not include studies whose design may have allowed them to capture egocentric
334 discounting, but which do not mention it among their findings, possibly because they did not
335 look for it. Possible examples include (Atkisson et al., 2012; Derex et al., 2015; Mesoudi,
336 2008; Mesoudi & O’Brien, 2008).
338 4.1. Evidence of Egocentric Discounting (3 publications)
340 Acerbi et al. (2016), one unique experiment. "… as in previous experiments social
341 information was generally underutilized" (p. 1)
343 Mesoudi (2011), one unique experiment. “… individual learning was chosen significantly
344 more often than payoff bias, random copying, conformity, and averaging.” (p. 338)
346 Mesoudi et al. (2015), one experiment with 4 populations: 3 out of 4 populations. "We
347 have … replicated, in our UK sample, the sub-optimal under-utilization of social information
348 observed in the UK sample of a previous study that used the same task. (...) Despite their
349 Chinese heritage, Hong-Kong and Chinese Immigrant participants were comparable to UK
350 participants in their copying frequencies." (p. 6) Note: The fourth sample (mainland China)
351 shows greater utilization of social learning, yet it is not clear whether social learning reaches
352 optimal level even in that group.
354 5. Cue-based learning tasks
356 5.1. Evidence of Egocentric Discounting (3 publications)
358 Harvey & Fischer (1997), all 2 experiments. “… [subjects’] ability to use advice to improve
359 judgement appears constrained by their overestimation of their own judgment skill relative to
360 that of people who have had as much or more training.”
362 Läpple & Barham (2019), one unique experiment. “… the subjects could have improved
363 further by utilizing more advice. Therefore, our finding is also in line with the general
364 literature on advice taking, which reports that people often discount advice and give greater
365 weight to their own opinion (…). … expert advice utilization was 48 percent, while subjects
366 put 52 percent of weight on their own initial estimate. This implies that on average, given own
367 and expert’s experience levels, subjects were egocentric towards their own opinions and
368 discounted advice” (p. 16–22)
370 Novaes Tump et al. (2018), one unique experiment. “… individuals were relatively
371 reluctant to incorporate social information and instead used suboptimal switching thresholds”
372 (p. 7)
374 6. “Ball-and-urn” cascade experiments (and variants)
376 The studies listed here originate as variants of Anderson & Holt’s protocol to test models of
377 information cascades (Anderson & Holt, 1996; Bikhchandani et al., 1998). In the original
378 design, participants sequentially make guesses concerning the probability of drawing a ball of
379 a given colour from an urn, based on their private information (the colour of one drawn ball)
380 and on the sequence of other participants’ previous bets. Studies using this basic design have
381 not been reviewed here: instead, we cite two authoritative meta-analyses. Variants of the basic
382 design include not informing participants of one previous choice instead of a whole sequence
383 (Çelen & Kariv 2004, 2005), or restricting access to the other participants’ decisions in
384 various ways. Performance is always incentivised.
386 6.1. Evidence of Egocentric Discounting (4 publications including 2 meta-analyses)
388 Çelen & Kariv (2004), one unique experiment. “…subjects give excessive weight to private
389 information relative to the public information revealed by the behaviour of others” (p. 497)
391 Çelen & Kariv (2005), one unique experiment. “… under imperfect information, follow-
392 own-signal heuristic out-performs Bayes’ rule as a predictor. In contrast, under perfect
393 information although in Bayesian terms subjects assign too much weight to their own
394 information and too little weight to the public information they gradually increase their
395 confidence in the information revealed by the history of actions taken before them.” (p. 695)
397 Weizsaecker (2010), meta-analysis of 13 experiments. “The average player contradicts her
398 own signal only if the empirical odds ratio of the own signal being wrong, conditional on all
399 available information, is larger than 2:1, rather than 1:1 as would be implied by rational
400 expectations.” (p. 2340)
402 Ziegelmeyer et al. (2013), meta-analysis of 13 experiments. “... participants quite often fail
403 to contradict their signal in decision situations where it is beneficial to do so though they
404 (almost) always follow their signal in the complementary set of decision situations.” (p. 7)
406 6.2. Evidence for an absence of bias (1 publication)
408 Duffy et al. (2019), one unique experiment. “Our experiment modifies the standard
409 sequential social learning setting. Subjects have to choose to observe either a private signal or
410 the decisions made by earlier subjects in the sequence, rather than having both forms of
411 information supplied by default. (…) In the aggregate, we find no overall bias for or against
412 private information. In other words, when mistakes can run both ways, they do indeed run
413 both ways.” (p. 27–28)
415 6.3. Evidence for the opposite effect (2 publications)
417 Çelen & Hyndman (2012), one unique experiment. “Our experiment consists of a group of
418 four subjects who sequentially make decisions on the same problem. Each subject is endowed
419 with a piece of information regarding the fundamentals of the problem. In addition to his
420 private information, each subject, before making a decision, is allowed to form links to his
421 predecessors. Forming a link is costly, yet it allows a subject to observe the actions of those
422 with whom he linked. (…) … we show that subjects have a tendency to form too many links.”
423 (p. 1526)
425 Goeree & Yariv (2015), one unique experiment. “… subjects choose between observing a
426 private (statistically informative) signal or the history of play of predecessors who have not
427 chosen a private signal (i.e., a statistically uninformative word-of-mouth signal). In our setup,
428 subjects choose the statistically uninformative social signal 34 % of the time and, of those,
429 88% follow their observed predecessors’ actions.” (p. 15)
