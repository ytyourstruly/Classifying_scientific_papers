Abstract
Research has generally suggested enhanced cognitive performance when
performing jointly with others in social settings. However, the interpersonal influence on
visuospatial attention was not well understood. With a newly developed dual attention
paradigm, we investigated how paying attention to the same spatial location with
another person affects one’s attention performance. Participant pairs independently
performed go/no-go tasks to visual targets while sustainedly attending to same or
different locations, and showed reduced attention effects when sharing spatial attention
(Experiment 1, N = 40). This dual attention effect relied on the presence of another
individual performing a similar task, being reversed when participants performed the
same task in isolation (Experiment 2, N = 38), and persisted under an increased
perceptual load (Experiment 3, N = 45). These data showed a diminishing effect of
shared attention, likely driven by stronger response inhibition or increased mentalizing/
monitoring when people attended together.
Statement of relevance
Paying attention towards the same spatial locations with other individuals is an
essential component of most human social interactions. We do this since childhood,
while trying to learn from our parents, and continue doing it throughout our lifetime.
Examples include a group of students attending together to a lecture and several
workers monitoring a product in an industrial assembly chain. This topic is highly
relevant to research fields involving social interactions and research questions on
fundamental cognitive functions (such as attention and memory). The present article
improves our understanding about how human attention is shaped when people
perform tasks together. We show that attention performance is impaired when people
jointly attend to the same spatial locations. These findings have ubiquitous real-life
implications, and may shed more light on how to optimize daily performance in
environments such as classrooms and working spaces.

Introduction
Humans are social animals immersed in social interactions and regularly
performing tasks with others. For these interactions to be successful, people need to
attend to spatial locations with other individuals. A group of students paying attention to
a teacher and a couple of workers monitoring a product on an assembly chain
represent only a few examples. However, the cognitive implications of this specific
aspect of our social life are not well understood. Here we investigated whether paying
attention towards the same spatial location with another person affects one’s attention
performance.
Since the first year of life, we follow other’s gaze and jointly attend to objects in
the environment with them. Termed joint attention (Frischen et al., 2007; Mundy &
Newell, 2007), this skill facilitates sharing, coordinating and cooperating in the social
world (Tomasello et al., 2005). Joint action research also illustrated that one can
process another individual’s task features as one’s own when working together (task
co-representation account), even if it does not benefit one’s own behaviour (He et al.
2011; Knoblich & Sebanz, 2006). Recent findings showed that, without gaze following
or joint action, the sole knowledge of paying attention to the same objects or tasks with
other individuals (i.e. shared attention; Shteynberg, 2015, 2018) is sufficient for leading
to preferential allocation of cognitive resources and better performance. However,
research has not investigated how the associated visuospatial attention performance
differs between attended and unattended spatial locations under shared attention. The
enhanced attention performance for attended locations is one of the most fundamental
aspects of human behaviour thus required further research from the shared attention
perspective.
Previous literature examined attentional allocation in hierarchical stimuli with a
joint Navon task (Böckler et al., 2012). There, participant pairs viewed global letter
stimuli made of local letters (e.g. a big “S” made of small “E”s) and focused on letter
identities at the global or local level. While the global advantage was maintained,
slower responses were found when two participants attended to different levels,
showing a conflict of attentional focuses (Böckler et al., 2012; Böckler & Sebanz,
2012). The temporal aspect of visual attention was also studied in social settings.
Inhibition of return (IOR) is a suppression of processing of stimuli recently being
attended (Klein, 2000). When two participants worked together, IOR was found for
locations previously attended by another person (Welsh et al., 2005, 2007).
Interestingly, this social IOR was dependent on participants’ belief and was found to be
weaker when visual cues preceding targets were believed to be computer-generated
rather than indicating another individual’s overt attentional focus (Gobel et al., 2018).
Despite these important findings, additional research was needed to examine
the social modulation of spatial attention performance. Theories proposed to explain
interpersonal influences often pointed towards shared representation of task
requirements and performance enhancement (e.g., Knoblich & Sebanz, 2006;
Shteynberg, 2015; however, see Mairon et al., 2020). Yet, visuospatial attention
performance in social settings has been largely missing from the picture. Some studies
addressed effects of shared attentional focus (e.g. Lachat et al., 2012; Wolf et al.,
2016) but did not investigate the spatial attention effect per se (i.e. the performance
difference between attended and unattended conditions). The current study
investigated the social modulation of spatial attention effects (termed dual attention).
The sustained visuospatial attention paradigm (Eimer, 1996) was adapted for
participant pairs (i.e. dual attention paradigm; Fig. 1), with two individuals
independently performing go/no-go tasks to visual targets while deploying sustained
attention to the same or different spatial locations. If dual attention, as suggested by
most social attention theories, benefits from shared experience, an enhanced spatial
attention effect would be expected when people shared their attentional locus.
Fig. 1. Stimuli and trial sequences. Participant pairs (Experiments 1 and 3, low and high task
loads respectively) or individuals (Experiment 2) performed covert sustained visuospatial
attention tasks (go/no-go responses). Participant pairs could attend to the same side or opposite
sides of a screen.
Experiment 1
Method
Participants
Twenty-four volunteer pairs with normal or corrected-to-normal vision
participated. Data from 40 participants (32 females, 8 males; 32 right-handed; aged
21.1 ± 3.0 years) were analysed after 8 participants being excluded due to low
accuracies (< 75%) in any design cell. Given that there was no previous literature on
the current research topic, the sample size was estimated with a power analysis for a
paired samples t-test on the contrast of interest (i.e., the attention effect changes when
the attentional loci were shared vs. unshared by the participants), targeting a medium
to large effect size (d = 0.45) and an alpha criterion of 0.05. The result suggested a
sample size of 40 in order to achieve a power of 80% to detect the targeted effect.
Twenty-four volunteer pairs with normal or corrected-to-normal vision
participated. Data from 40 participants (32 females, 8 males; 32 right-handed; aged
21.1 ± 3.0 years) were analysed after 8 participants being excluded due to low
accuracies (< 75%) in any design cell. Participants in each pair reported not having a
close relationship. Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained.
Materials and procedure
Participant pairs sat next to each other in front of a computer monitor at a
viewing distance of 70 cm and independently performed sustained visuospatial
attention tasks. There were four two-block sessions, each block having 160 trials, with
attending instructions varying between sessions. In each session, each participant in a
pair covertly attended to one side of the screen (50%:50% probability), resulting in the
pair attending to the same side (attention shared) or different sides (attention not
shared) of the screen with equal probabilities. Each participant acknowledged
awareness of the other person’s task.
The two participants in a pair performed discrimination tasks (go/no-go) with
different assigned targets. Stimuli were large/small circles and squares. Each
participant performed a go/no-go task. Each person was assigned one shape as their
shape feature (e.g. circle) and to quickly respond to the large items of that shape
(targets; e.g. large circles) presented in either side of the screen and withhold
responses to other stimuli (non-targets; e.g. small circles) and the other shape (e.g.
square). The large stimuli subtended 4.57 x 4.57°, while the small ones 2.38 x 2.38°
(30% of the area of a large stimulus), presented in white against a black background.
In each block, participants were requested to fixate on a white fixation cross
(0.54×0.54˚) at the screen centre throughout the block. Each trial randomly displayed
one stimulus 8.68˚ (centre-to-centre) to one side of the screen for 150ms, followed by
an interval of 1,350ms. For each shape feature, the attended side contained 75% of the
targets (attended trials) and 25% of the non-targets (unattended trials), while the other
side contained 25% of the targets and 75% of the non-targets. Participants responded
as quickly as possible (within 1,000 ms) whenever detecting a target by pressing a
mouse button (the participant on the right) or the spacebar on a keyboard (the person
on the left). Each experimental session had eight blocks, varying the instructed focus of
attention (i.e., along a specific block, the attended side for each participant could be as
follows: P1:left / P2:left, or P1:left / P2:right, or P1:right / P2:left, or P1:right / P2:right;
P1=Participant 1, P2=Participant 2). These task instructions changed every two blocks.
Each participant was informed about the experiment partner’s instructions at the
beginning of each experimental block. They had to acknowledge reading the
instructions regarding the experiment partner’s task. Several questionnaires were also
completed (see Supplemental Material for details).
Statistical analyses
All analyses were performed using R (version 1.1.456) and RStudio (RStudio
Team, 2016). Accuracies and reaction times (RTs) were analysed with analyses of
variance (ANOVAs) on means (R package ‘ez’; Lawrence, 2016) and robust methods
on 20% trimmed means (R package ‘WRS’; Wilcox & Schönbrodt, 2014). The latter
works well both in the presence and absence of violations of statistical assumptions
and increases statistical power and robustness over the arithmetic mean (Field &
Wilcox, 2017; Wilcox, 2012). Statistical contrasts with the percentile bootstrap method
on 20% trimmed means (Rousselet, Pernet, & Wilcox, 2019) were used to follow up
ANOVA results to assess their robustness to outliers and to assumption violations. The
percentile bootstrap results were presented as differences between trimmed means ψ,
the associated bootstrap 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs, reported simply as “CI”s
below), and p-values. For relevant statistical interactions, Bayes factors were computed
(R package ‘BayesFactor’; Morey & Rouder, 2018) with the default prior (Jeffreys-
Zellner-Siow) following the suggestion for situations when no prior information is
available (Wagenmakers et al., 2018). Figures were made using the R packages ‘yarrr’
(Phillips, 2017) and ‘ggplot2’ (Wickham, 2016).
Results
Participants showed high hit rates (97.1%, CI [95.7%, 98.5%]) and low false
alarm rates (1.9%, CI [1.4%, 2.3%]). The accuracy data were not analysed further due
to the near-ceiling performance. RTs in go-trials with correct manual responses were
analysed. 4.5% of the data were removed as outliers determined with a threshold of 2.5
times the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) for each design cell (Leys et al., 2013).
Mean RTs data (Fig. 2) were submitted to a 2x2 repeated-measures ANOVA
with within-subjects factors Attention (attended vs. unattended) and Sharing (shared vs.
unshared). A significant main effect of Attention was observed, F(1, 39) = 70.45, p
< .001, η =0.068, showing shorter RTs in the attended (411 ms, CI [396 ms, 426 ms])
than the unattended conditions (438 ms, CI [422 ms, 454 ms]). The main effect of
Sharing was not significant, F(1, 39) = 0.99, p = .325 (shared 427 ms, CI [411 ms, 443
ms]) vs. unshared 423 ms, CI [407 ms, 438 ms]). Attention significantly interacted with
Sharing, F(1, 39) = 9.10, p = .004, η = 0.004. The attention effect was smaller when
attention was shared (21 ms, CI [14 ms, 28 ms]), F(1, 39) = 36.06 , p < .001, η = 0.04,
than when it was not shared (33 ms, CI [25 ms, 41 ms]), F(1, 39) = 63.76 , p < .001, η
= 0.10. This reduction of the attention effect by sharing situations was termed dual
attention effect in the current setup.
The results from the within-within design percentile bootstrap on 20% trimmed
means showed consistent results with a significant main effect of attention (ψ = -53 [-
66, -41], p = 0), a non-significant main effect of Sharing (ψ = -8 [-22, 5], p =.223), and a
significant interaction (ψ = -12 [-21, -3], p =.006). For the Bayes factors analysis, the
attention effect was computed (subtracting the RTs in the attended condition from the
RTs in the unattended condition) and compared across sharing conditions. BFs
remained insensitive. The data were only 2.267 times more likely under an attention
effect modulation, than under the null model (BF = 2.267).
Discussion
Contrary to the prediction, Experiment 1 showed a reduced attention effect
when the participant pairs attended to the same spatial locations than when their loci of
attention differed, which effect was termed as dual attention effect. This added to the
literature showing negative effects of shared experience (e.g. Mairon et al., 2020), and
disagrees with most shared attention research. One potential explanation was that the
dual attention effect was not socially driven. Instead, it could be elicited by probabilistic
properties of the adapted task. It is typical to have more targets on the attended side of
the screen to encourage sustained attention. Here, this was implemented for both
participants with the overall stimulus distribution balanced by having the unattended
side containing more non-targets. However, the trial target/non-target distributions
differed between the shared and unshared conditions. This trial imbalance might have
induced an unwanted attention bias and led to the current finding. Experiment 2 was
employed to address this possibility.

attention effect. (c) The attention effect in each participant, with lines representing paired

mean.
Experiment 2
Experiment 2 tested solo participants with the same paradigm. If the finding
obtained in Experiment 1 was due to the differential distribution of targets across
attention sharing conditions, Experiment 2 should replicate this result. A social effect
would be argued instead if the result would differ from that of Experiment 1.
Method
Participants and procedure
Forty-three individuals with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated.
Data from 38 participants (23 females, 15 males; 30 right-handed; aged 23.1 ± 4.2
years) were analysed with 5 participants being excluded from analysis due to accuracy
below 75% in any design cell.
The stimuli and procedure were identical to those of Experiment 1, except that
participants performed the task individually by responding to a single assigned target
stimulus. Therefore, the “Sharing” factor reflected the unbalanced distribution of stimuli
across attention sharing conditions in Experiment 1.
Results
Participants showed a high performance in the task (mean hit rate 97.4%, CI
[96.0%, 98.7%]; mean false alarm rate 1.3%, CI [1.0%, 1.6%]). Due to the near-ceiling
performance, accuracies were not further analysed.
RTs were analysed as in Experiment 1 (Fig. 3), with 5.1% of the data removed
as outliers with the same 2.5 MAD protocol. The ANOVA factor names were kept
identical to those in Experiment 1 to allow comparisons. There was a significant effect
of Attention (attended 441 ms, CI [423 ms, 458 ms] vs. unattended 457 ms, CI [440
ms, 474 ms]), F(1, 37) = 54.20, p < .001, η =0.022, but no effect of Sharing (shared
450 ms, CI [432 ms, 468 ms] vs. unshared 448 ms, CI [431 ms, 465 ms]), F(1, 37) =
0.30, p = .585. Importantly, the Attention x Sharing interaction was significant, F(1, 37)
= 33.74, p < .001, η =0.025, and was in the opposite direction to that of Experiment 1.
The attention effect was significant in the shared condition (33 ms, CI [26 ms, 41 ms]),
F(1, 37) = 78.05 , p < .001, η =0.082, but non-significant in the unshared condition (-1
ms, CI [-8 ms, 6 ms]), F(1, 37) = 0.07 , p = .780.
The percentile bootstrap on 20% trimmed means showed the same results,
namely a significant effect of Attention, ψ = 29 [17, 43], p = 0, a non-significant effect of
^ ^
Sharing, ψ = -6 [-17, 7], p = .354, and a significant interaction, ψ = -31 [-42, -22], p = 0.
Bayesian analysis provided extreme evidence for the attention effects difference
between Sharing conditions, relative to the null model, given the data, BF =
1,651,410.

conditions (95% CIs displayed). The attention effect is smaller in the unshared than in the
shared conditions. (c) The attention effect in each participant. 32 out of the 38 analysed
participants showed the same trend as the group mean.
Contrasting attention effects (Experiments 1 vs. 2)
To compare the attention effects between paired and solo situations, mean RTs
in Experiments 1 and 2 were submitted to a three-way mixed ANOVA with an additional
between-subjects factor Pairing (paired vs. solo). A significant main effect of Pairing
was found, F(1, 76) = 4.59, p = .035, η =0.052, due to longer RTs in Experiment 2 (449
ms , CI [432 ms, 466 ms]) than in Experiment 1 (425 ms, CI [410 ms, 440 ms]). More
importantly, there was a significant three-way interaction, F(1, 76) = 42.87, p < .001, η
=0.013, suggesting that the modulation of the attention effect by sharing differed
between experiments (Fig. 4). The dual attention effect (i.e. the attention effect
difference between sharing situations, unshared minus shared) was 12 ms (CI [4 ms,
21 ms]) when participants were paired (Experiment 1) but turned out to be -34 ms (CI [-
46 ms, -22 ms]) in the solo situation (Experiment 2), showing opposite patterns across
experiments.
The between-within-within percentile bootstrap on 20% trimmed means showed
the same results, i.e. a significant effect of Pairing (ψ = 108 [23, 197], p = .014) and a
significant three-way interaction (ψ = 46 [31, 65], p = 0). Bayesian analysis of the
attention effect modulations also revealed the data were more likely under the Sharing
x Pairing interaction than under the null, BF = 2,254,602.

(unattended minus attended) as a function of Sharing across experiments (i.e. Pairing:

differences, unshared minus shared) between experiments. Group means are displayed with
95% CIs.
Discussion
The result showed the opposite modulation pattern of the attention effect to that
in Experiment 1. Instead of showing a reduction, the attention effect was significant in
the “shared” condition but absent in the “unshared” condition. This pattern in fact could
be explained by the trial distribution. In the “unshared” condition, both visual fields
contained large stimuli with equal probabilities. Despite that only one shape requested
manual responses, attention might not be well biased towards the field containing most
of the targets. This is consistent with the goal-contingent bias notion (Folk et al., 1992)
with the large size being the contingent feature and capturing attention.
More importantly, given that the social context of the task (the presence of task
partners and their task demands) was the only difference between the two
experiments, the data suggest that the dual attention effect (i.e. attention effect
reduction) was indeed social in nature. The shorter overall RTs in Experiment 1 (paired)
than in Experiment 2 (solo) agrees with the social facilitation (Zajonc, 1965) and shared
attention (Shteynberg, 2015, 2018) theories, which predict better performance when
people attend to the same task together. However, the reduced visuospatial attention
performance in the shared condition contradicted these theories.
This dual attention effect found in Experiment 1 would unlikely be explained by
social loafing either, which refers to reduced motivation and effort when people work
collectively (Karau & Williams, 1993). First, the RTs were not prolonged in the shared
condition, not showing a general reduced effort. Second, it has been shown that when
participants performed different tasks and each individual’s responses were identifiable,
it was less likely for social loafing to occur (Harkins & Petty, 1982). To further exclude
the possibility of social loafing, it was desirable to run another experiment with
increased task difficulty. Indeed, it has been shown that social loafing was reduced or
even overturned with increased task difficulty (Harkins & Petty, 1982; Jackson &
Williams, 1985). The Load theory (Benoni, 2018; Lavie, 2010; Murphy et al., 2016) also
suggests that an increased perceptual load reduces processing of distracting
information (task requirements related to another individual in this case) and could lead
to weaker interpersonal influence.
Experiment 3
Experiment 3 increased perceptual load by making target and non-target stimuli
more similar. Social loafing would be expected to be weaken by this perceptual load
manipulation. Thus, if social loafing was the reason for the dual attention effect, the
effect would be diminished or reversed in the current experiment. Alternatively, a dual
attention effect unaffected by perceptual load would suggest that the interfering social
information employs resources from a separate process or attentional capacity
(Benoni, 2018; Murphy et al., 2016)
Method
Participants and procedure
Twenty-four participant pairs with normal or corrected-to-normal vision took
part. Data from 45 participants (33 females, 12 males; 41 right-handed; age 23.5 ± 5.2)
were analysed, with 3 participants being excluded from analysis due to accuracies
below 50% in any design cell. This new accuracy threshold was adopted for the
increased task difficulty. Participants in all pairs reported not having a close
relationship.
The stimuli and procedure were identical to those of Experiment 1, with the exception
being the increased size of the non-target stimuli (from 2.38 x 2.38° to 3.97 x 3.97°,
now 75% of the area of the target stimuli).
Results
The mean hit rate (83.4%, CI [80.7%, 86.1%]) was lower, and the mean false
alarm rate (4.6%, CI [3.8%, 5.3%]) was higher, than that in Experiment 1 (mean hit
rate: 97.1%, CI [95.7%, 98.5%]; mean false alarm rate: 1.9%, CI [1.4%, 2.3%]) due to
the higher task load. The 2 Attention (attended vs. unattended) x 2 Sharing (shared vs.
unshared) ANOVA on mean accuracies did not find any main effect of Attention or
Sharing, but revealed a significant interaction, F(1, 44) = 10.52, p = .002, η = 0.011.
This interaction was confirmed by the percentile bootstrapping on 20% trimmed means,
ψ = 4.63 [1.57, 7.65], p = .003. The attention effects showed opposite directions for
unshared (attended 84.9% vs. unattended 81.7%; attention effect -3.2%, CI [-5.51%, -
0.89%]) and shared (attended 82.8% vs. unattended 84.2%; attention effect 1.35%, CI
[-0.88%, 3.58%]) conditions.
RTs were analysed as before after 5.0% of data were removed as outliers with
the same 2.5 MAD protocol. Results replicated those of Experiment 1 (Fig. 5). There
were a significant effect of Attention (attended 479 ms, CI [465 ms, 494 ms] vs.
unattended 504 ms, CI [488 ms, 519 ms]), F(1, 44) = 89.20, p < .001, η = 0.048, and a
significant Attention x Sharing interaction, F(1, 44) = 10.58, p = 0.002, η = 0.005. The
same dual attention effect as in Experiment 1 was found, showing a smaller attention
effect in the shared condition (17 ms, CI [10 ms, 23 ms], F(1, 44) = 24.70 , p < .001, η
= 0.027) than in the unshared condition (32 ms, CI [25 ms, 39 ms], F(1, 44) = 77.28, p
< .001, η = 0.070). The main effect of Sharing was not significant (shared 486 ms, CI
[472 ms, 501 ms] vs. unshared 497 ms, CI [476 ms, 514 ms]), F(1, 44) = 3.63, p
= .063. This dual attention effect was not due to an accuracy-RT trade-off.
This pattern was confirmed by the robust method, which showed a significant
^ ^
effect of Attention, ψ = -45 [-57, -35], p = 0, a non-significant effect of Sharing, ψ = 13 [-
2, 31], p = .079, and a significant interaction, ψ = -17 [-25, -8], p < .001. The Bayesian
analysis of the attention effects also supported this interaction with strong evidence,
BF = 13.8.

Contrasting attention effects (Experiments 1 vs. 3)
To compare Experiment 1 and Experiment 3, mean accuracies were submitted
to a 3-way Mixed ANOVA, adding Load (Easy vs. Hard) as between-subject factor. This
yielded a significant main effect of Load, F(1, 83) = 77.00, p < .001, η =0.399, given
that participants performed better in Experiment 1 (M = 97.14 %, 95%CI [95.74, 98.54])
than in Experiment 3 (M = 83.41 %, 95%CI [80.71, 86.11]). The robust test
(‘bwwmcppb’ function; Wilcox, 2012) supported this result, ψ = 56.2 [43.3, 68.2], p = 0.
In addition, the classic 3-way ANOVA also yielded a significant interaction Attention x
Sharing, F(1, 83) = 13.25, p < .001, η =0.002, but this was not the case for the robust
test, ψ = 8.78 [-0.34, 12.9], p = .060. Regarding this disparity, it should be mentioned
that robust methods are generally preferred (and their results trusted more) over
classic statistical tests, especially when addressing accuracies data, known to violate
the normality assumption associated to the latter (Field & Wilcox, 2017).
Mean RTs in Experiments 1 and 3 were submitted to a three-way mixed ANOVA
with a between-subjects factor Load (Easy vs. Hard). A significant effect of Load was
obtained, F(1, 83) = 39.78, p < .001, η = 0.290, showing longer RTs in Experiment 3
(492 ms, CI [477, 507]) than in Experiment 1 (425 ms, CI [410, 440]).The three-way
interaction was not significant, F(1, 83) = 0.21, p = .650. The dual attention effect (i.e.
the attention effect difference between sharing conditions, unshared minus shared) was
comparable between Experiments 1 (12 ms, CI [4, 21]) and 3 (15 ms, CI [6, 25]).
The between-within-within percentile bootstrap on 20% trimmed means
confirmed the above findings with a significant Load effect (ψ = -284 [-355, -205], p = 0)
and a non-significant three-way interaction (ψ = 3 [-13, 18], p = .734). The absence of
differential dual attention effect was also supported by Bayesian analysis, which

Discussion
The result replicated the finding of Experiment 1, while a higher task difficulty
was confirmed by the significantly longer RTs and lower accuracies. The absence of
modulation of the dual attention effect by perceptual load agrees with earlier discussion
dismissing a contribution by social loafing.
General Discussion
When visual attention was deployed by two individuals to the same location,
visuospatial attention performance was impaired (i.e. the dual attention effect). The
manipulations of social presence (Experiment 2) and perceptual load (Experiment 3)
were both effective, as evidenced by the general slowing down without the social
presence of another person and worse performance (lower response accuracy and
longer RTs) in the harder task. The dual attention effect was not modulated by task
difficulty yet relied on the presence of another individual sharing the visuospatial
attention task. These findings suggest that the dual attention effect is a social
phenomenon resistant to high perceptual load. However, in contrast to most of the
findings on joint action and shared attention (e.g. Knoblich & Sebanz, 2006;
Shteynberg, 2015), the current findings were not due to one individual representing
both participants’ task requirement or general performance enhancement with the
presence of another acting person.
The dual attention effect could be explained by changes in response inhibition
across attention sharing conditions. Evaluative pressure increases distractability of
irrelevant stimuli comprising features contingent to one’s task set (Belletier et al., 2019;
Normand, Bouquet, & Croizet, 2014). This interference occurs at the response
selection stage due to a greater visuomotor priming from the irrelevant (but contingent)
stimuli (Normand et al., 2014). In the current paradigm, the contingent interference
arose from another individual’s targets, which shared a key feature (stimulus size) of
one’s own targets, leading to response priming that required inhibition. Furthermore,
attending to the same spatial location with a task partner potentially caused an
increased evaluative pressure (relative to the unshared condition), leading to higher
distractability, a heightened contingent interference, and subsequently a higher level of
response inhibition. This response inhibition was reflected in the impaired attention
effect. It is worth noting that the attended location did not act as the contingent feature
since that would predict a RT difference between the attention shared and unshared
conditions, here absent. Instead, the attended spatial location served as “glue” that
bound visual features together (Spence & Frings, 2020; Treisman & Gelade, 1980). A
jointly attended location might make the features related to another person more
distracting and harder to ignore, if they relate to one’s current task. The need of
visuomotor priming inhibition may also come from task co-representation and
mentalizing. Co-representing a partner’s targets could activate one’s own target-
relevant response (Knoblich & Sebanz, 2006) which, given the unbalanced trial
distribution, was stronger and in more need of being inhibited in the shared than
unshared attention conditions.
Moreover, it has been argued that jointly attending to the same spatial location
increases bonding between the co-attending individuals and might induce mentalizing
(Wolf et al., 2016). The knowledge of attending to the same spatial location with
another person could possibly lead to cognitive processes similar to those involved in
joint attention, including mentalizing and monitoring the other individual, which are
crucial for behavioural coordination (Mundy & Newell, 2007; Tomasello et al., 2005).
These higher cognitive processes may consume mental resources and negatively
impact on the attention performance.
The competition between mentalizing and dual attention is also consistent with
the absence of modulation by perceptual load. The persistence of the dual attention
effect under a high perceptual load suggests that the effect is unlikely a sensory-level
process, and potentially higher in cognition (Handy & Mangun, 2000; Handy, et al.,
2001). An alternative explanation of the high load data would be an efficient/automatic
dual attention process, which does not require attentional resources (Benoni, 2018;
Lavie, 2010; Murphy et al., 2016), in line with the features of joint attention (Frischen et
al., 2007). However, this explanation does not agree well with the earlier suggestion of
a higher cognitive dual attention process, thus less likely to be true.
Overall, the current study revealed a striking interpersonal influence on
visuospatial attention (dual attention). This effect impaired attention performance when
people attended to the same spatial location irrespective of perceptual load. These
findings highlight the importance of examining visuospatial attention in future social
interaction research.
