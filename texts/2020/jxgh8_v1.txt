ABSTRACT
Human facial structures communicate personality from which one can infer
another’s behavioral intentions, forming a basis for mate selection. One particularly
detectable trait through facial structures is extraversion. Extraversion is a trait associated
with heightened interest in promiscuous mating strategies and preferred among
individuals similarly interested in short-term mating, implicating extraverted mates as
ideal trait for short-term mating. Nonetheless, behavioral repertoires associated with
extraversion may also pose risks, particularly in long-term mating, as their increased
promiscuity may undermine their fidelity to a specific partner, thereby potentially
reducing biparental investment in any offspring produced. Thus, a preference for
introversion (i.e., low extraversion) may be desirable in long-term mating. This
dissertation sought to determine the extent to which differential mating contexts, as
elicited through activating context-specific motives, influence preferences for facially
communicated extraversion versus introversion. Men and women were experimentally
primed with mating motives, either long- or short-term, or a control state before
indicating the extent to which various mating-related motivational states were activated
(i.e., arousal, intrasexual competition, infidelity concerns, sociosexually unrestricted
attitudes). Finally, I tasked them with indicating their preferences among male and female
face pairs manipulated to communicate high and low levels of extraversion. Consistent
with previous research, participants reported a preference for extraverted female faces
and aversion to extraverted male faces. However, and contrary to hypotheses, differential
mating contexts influenced neither men’s nor women’s preferences for extraversion.
Furthermore, no motivational states provided the predicted mediation pathways. I frame
ii
these results based on various methodological limitations that could inform future
research and posit future directions.

CHAPTER I BACKGROUND
Selecting a mate capable of satisfying various goals related to specific mating
contexts is paramount to reproductive success, necessitating sensitivity to those
possessing psychological and physical characteristics that would facilitate salient mating
goals. Human reproduction is aided through the identification of individuals who can
optimally facilitate production of healthy offspring capable of successful reproduction
themselves and partners willing and capable of investing in offspring (Trivers, 1972),
because human offspring are born vulnerable and require significant resource
contributions from both parents. Accordingly, humans focus on both short-term
relationships, emphasizing partner traits that facilitate the production of healthy offspring,
and long-term relationships, emphasizing considerable resource investment in any
offspring produced (Gangestad & Simpson, 2000).
Salient mating goals predict preferences for facial structures connoting various
personality traits, with structures connoting extraversion being particularly important in
weighing mate selection decisions (Brown & Sacco, 2017a). Given extraverted
individuals’ interest in promiscuous mating strategies (Schmitt & Shackelford, 2008) and
heightened physical attractiveness (Lukaszewski & Roney, 2011), extraverted
prospective mates may satisfy important selection criteria in short-term mating contexts.
Conversely, introverted individuals’ reduced proclivity toward promiscuity may connote
greater relationship fidelity, thereby implicating facially communicated introversion as
ideal in long-term mating contexts.
Context-Dependency in Mate Preferences
Although procuring an individual mate who equally and effectively solves all
reproductive problems is ideal, any given partner will likely only satisfy certain
reproductive goals better than others. According to sexual strategies theory, context-
dependent mating goals should influence partner preferences, whereby certain traits
become prioritized based on given contexts (Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Kenrick, Groth,
Trost, & Sadalla, 1993). Men and women can both benefit from either a short-term
(STM) or long-term mating (LTM) focus. Men focusing on STM can increase their
overall number of offspring produced, whereas women’s STM focus facilitates the
identification of partners with traits indicating heightened capacity to produce healthy
and fertile offspring. Conversely, men and women’s LTM focus could facilitate their
ability to identify partners motivated to invest parentally, thereby increasing the chances
of offspring survival to reproductive age. Thus, both men and women should demonstrate
differential sensitivity to prospective mates’ social cues connoting mate qualities when
selecting partners to facilitate mating success.
Men and women contextually value, and select, different constellations of traits,
to ensure both STM and LTM success (Buss & Schmitt, 1993; Li et al., 2013; Li &
Kenrick, 2006). STM emphasizes strategic pluralism, or the acquisition of mates for
brief, uncommitted sexual encounters (Gangestad & Simpson, 2000). This emphasis
necessitates the acquisition of mates exhibiting good genes, particularly cues associated
with physical attractiveness. Such cues indicate a potential mate’s ability to produce
healthy offspring subsequently capable of successful reproduction themselves (Thornhill
& Gangestad, 2006). For example, women emphasizing STM strategies prioritize men’s
muscularity and facial masculinity (i.e., square jawline and wide forehead), which
communicate greater immune system functioning and fertility (Frederick & Haselton,
2007; Little, Burt, Penton-Voak, & Perrett, 2001; Penton-Voak & Chen, 2004; Sacco,
Jones, DeBruine, & Hugenberg, 2012). Men emphasizing such strategies prioritize
fertility cues in women’s bodies (e.g., 0.7 waist-to-hip ratio; Confer, Perilloux, & Buss,
2010; Singh, 1993) and feminized facial features (i.e., round face, full lips; Smith et al.,
2006), which collectively communicate sexual availability, increased likelihood of
impregnation following a single act of intercourse, and heightened capacity for
successfully birthing offspring without complications. Women prioritizing STM also
prefer men with agentic, dominant personalities who adopt promiscuous mating strategies
(Aitkens, Lyons, & Jonason, 2013; Brown & Sacco, 2017a; Durante, Griskevicius,
Simpson, Cantú, & Li, 2012; Jonason & Buss, 2012; Kruger, Fisher, & Jobling, 2003;
Marcinkowska, Helle, & Lyons, 2015). This preference affords access to good genes
associated with such personalities without having to incur interpersonal costs following a
single act of intercourse (e.g., infidelity; Jonason, Li, & Buss, 2010; Nettle, 2005).
LTM refers to committed pair-bonding, which necessitates that men and women
prioritize different traits in potential partners. Although physical attractiveness remains
desirable in LTM, most notably for men, women additionally emphasize traits indicating
men’s access to resources and willingness to invest such resources in offspring (Buss,
1989; Guéguen, 2014; Jonason, Li, & Madson, 2012; Kenrick et al., 1993; Li, Bailey,
Kenrick, & Linsenmeier, 2002). Nonetheless, across cultures, both men and women
recognize benevolence and relationship fidelity as the most desirable traits in evaluating
long-term mates, particularly for those with heightened LTM interest (Barclay, 2010;
Brown & Sacco, 2019; Brown, Sacco, & Medlin, 2019a; Buss, 1989; Li et al., 2002). For
men, preferring fidelity in a female partner reduces concerns of unknowingly rearing
genetically unrelated offspring, thereby ensuring investment in offspring that would
facilitate their own inclusive fitness (Platek & Shackelford, 2006). Women’s preference
for faithful men reduces concerns of resource diversion to other women and offspring not
their own. Importantly, because extraversion is associated with gregariousness and
promiscuity (Nettle, 2005; Schmitt & Shackelford, 2008), men and women motivated by
LTM may emphasize introversion to avoid potential infidelity costs associated with
extraverted individuals. Women’s large reproductive costs further position them to have a
particularly strong introversion preference for LTM selection (Trivers, 1972).
Extraversion and Mating
Various personality traits correlate with differing levels of LTM and STM
interest, implicating certain personalities as ideal for different mating contexts (Schmitt &
Shackelford, 2008). Identifying prospective mates’ personality would be adaptive in
inferring the extent to which a given person could satisfy relevant mating goals. For
example, marital satisfaction is highest among agreeable partners, suggesting agreeable
mates are ideal for LTM (Botwin, Buss, & Shackelford, 1997). Conversely, agreeable
individuals are averse to promiscuity, undermining their STM attractiveness (Schmitt &
Shackelford, 2008). Extraverts utilize pluralistic mating strategies more than introverts,
implicating extraversion as attractive in STM (Nettle, 2005; Schmitt, 2004; Schmitt &
Shackelford, 2008). Identifying and selecting extraverted mates would benefit those
motivated by STM, whereas such decisions may be costly for those prioritizing LTM.
Associating with extraverted conspecifics has numerous social benefits. Their
gregariousness affords extensive affiliative opportunities (Pollet, Roberts, & Dunbar,
2011). Selection may have favored gregariousness to ensure availability of sociable
conspecifics, thus leading to specific genes implicated in extraversion becoming
pervasive (Buss, 2009; Penke, Dennisen, & Miller, 2007). Extraversion’s interpersonal
agency and gregariousness in affiliative domains may translate to STM desirability, as
evidenced by extraverted individuals’ proficiency in initiating relationships (Ashton &
Lee, 2007; Nettle, 2005). Genes implicated in STM desirability may have thus emerged
from social selection of gregariousness. Extraversion is associated with short Cytosine-
Adenine-Guanine codon repeats, a gene expression for heightened androgenic receptor
activity associated with heightened physical strength and dominance in men that is
attractive in STM (Lukaszewski & Roney, 2011; Simmons & Roney, 2011; Westberg et
al., 2009). Extraverted men and women are also more physically attractive, with
extraverted men possessing considerably greater physical strength relative to introverted
men (Cheng, Tracy, & Henrich, 2010; Fink, Weege, Pham, & Shackelford, 2016;
Lukaszewski & Roney, 2011; Pound, Penton-Voak, & Brown, 2007).
Desirable traits afforded by genes associated with extraversion may subsequently
provide extraverted individuals increased STM opportunities, which could heighten their
proclivity toward promiscuous mating strategies, given their likelihood of success in such
pursuits (Lukaszewski & Roney, 2011; Provenzano, Dane, Farrell, Marini, & Volk,
2018). Extraverted women also strongly prefer facial masculinity, a preference akin to
sociosexually unrestricted women’s good genes preference (Sacco, Hugenberg, & Sefcek,
2009; Welling, DeBruine, Little, & Jones, 2009). Extraversion may therefore facilitate
optimum STM experiences between individuals with good genes and similar STM
interests. Men’s proclivity toward promiscuity would further position them as especially
interested in extraverted women when STM is salient due to the increased sexual
availability associated with female extraversion (Schmitt, 2003).
Although extraversion is ostensibly ideal in STM, certain aspects of the trait
undermines its LTM desirability. For example, preferring extraverted men in STM
affords women access to good genes (i.e., extraverted men’s physical dominance),
without incurring costs from continued association following a single act of intercourse.
Thus, benefits of mating with dominant men in STM outweigh the costs (Gangestad &
Simpson, 2000). Nonetheless, continued association with extraverted partners may leave
women vulnerable to the costs of antagonistic partners, specifically a partner prone to
aggressive mate guarding tactics and possessiveness (Holden, Zeigler-Hill, Pham, &
Shackelford, 2014). Additionally, extraverted long-term mates could be costly when
considering their proclivity toward infidelity (Nettle, 2005; Schmitt, 2004). This
proclivity further suggests extraverted women would increase men’s concerns of paternal
uncertainty. Women may also perceive extraverted men as unreliable in providing
resources for mates and offspring. Thus, introversion may ultimately be preferable in
LTM. Introverted individuals’ disinterest in promiscuous mating strategies should
augment their long-term desirability, as interest in promiscuity is typically a dealbreaker
in long-term contexts (Jonason, Garcia, Webster, Li, & Fisher, 2015). Because of the
greater reproductive costs women face compared to men, resulting in especially judicious
mate selection (Haselton & Buss, 2000), it would follow that women’s preferences for
introverted men in LTM contexts would be greater relative men’s preference for
introverted women in such contexts.
Facial Personality and Mate Selection
The importance of identifying mates whose personalities would optimize mating
goals, it becomes incumbent upon perceivers to detect prospective mates’ personalities.
Although personality is typically assessed through self- and other-reports, the Realistic
Accuracy Model posits detection also occurs through a multimodality of interpersonal
cues (Funder, 1995, 2012). In fact, only brief exposure is frequently necessary for such
inferences (e.g., Ambady & Rosenthal, 1992). Perceivers demonstrate perceptual acuity
when assessing others’ personalities based on interpersonal behavior, with the
interpersonal components of extraversion being the most easily detected of all Big Five
traits (Borkenau, Mauer, Riemann, Spinath, & Angleitner, 2004). Personality inferences
may be rooted in inferences of targets’ behavioral intentions connoting certain
personalities. If one can infer the associated behavioral intentions through such cues, then
one can more effectively identify another’s affordance in facilitating the perceiver’s goals
(Zebrowitz & Collins, 1997; Sacco & Brown, 2018a), including those related to mating.
Human facial structures are robust channels through which personality is
adaptively inferred. Much of human history involved direct, physical face-to-face
interactions, necessitating specific capacities to infer valuable social information through
faces (Argyle & Cook, 1976). To facilitate such communication, humans have evolved
strategies for extracting information from target faces (e.g., mutual eye gaze, emotion
recognition). Beyond facilitating general social interactions, faces communicate specific
information pertinent to mating. Facial structures can cue mate value, particularly related
to a target’s overall health and mating intentions (Parkinson, 2005; Rhodes, 2006).
Within these inferences, perceivers are capable of detecting personality through facial
structures, particularly those connoting Big Five Personality traits (Little & Perrett,
2007). Such perceptual acuity occurs at minimal exposure, with raters accurately
identifying the exemplification of a given trait following 50-150ms of exposure
(Borkenau, Brecke, Möttig, & Paelecke, 2009). Importantly, inferences were most
apparent in detecting extraversion (Penton-Voak, Little, Pound, & Perrett, 2006; Kramer,
& Ward, 2010; Little & Perrett, 2007). Inferring social targets’ level of extraversion
would be adaptive for subsequent affiliative decisions based on perceptions of extraverts’
ability to satisfy certain goals. Accurately identifying a target as extraverted through
facial structures would implicate that person as able to satisfy STM goals, whereas these
inferences should subsequently elicit perceptions of inability to satisfy LTM goals.
Preferences for Facial Extraversion
Salient goals influence interpersonal preferences based on the extent to which
targets’ faces communicate extraversion (Sacco & Brown, 2018a). These affiliative
decisions are contingent upon an assessment of the benefits and costs associated with
such personalities and which is prioritized by these goals. For example, extraverts have
considerable interest in affiliation and increasing extraversion predicts increased social
network size (Pollet et al., 2011); this implicates extraverts as offering extensive
affiliative opportunities resulting in greater preferences for facially communicated
extraversion by those with activated affiliation needs. Indeed, those with a heightened
need to belong, both dispositionally and following an exclusionary experience, prefer
extraversion (Brown & Sacco, 2017b; Brown, Sacco, & Medlin, 2019b). Conversely,
extensive interpersonal contact facilitates disease transmission, implicating extraversion
as a pathogenic threat (Nettle, 2005; Schaller & Murray, 2008). Heightened perceived
vulnerability to disease elicits aversion to facially communicated extraversion,
particularly among opposite-sex faces (Brown & Sacco, 2016). People can identify
extraverted behavioral repertoires by facial structure and subsequently decide whether
such behaviors are costly or advantageous (Sacco, Young, & Hugenberg, 2014).
Germane to this conversation is the relative sensitivity toward facial extraversion
among those dispositionally interested in STM. Sociosexually unrestricted women,
women particularly interested in STM, are sensitive to facial structures connoting
extraversion in male faces, such that they more preferred male facially communicated
extraversion relative to restricted women (Brown & Sacco, 2017a). Interestingly,
sociosexually unrestricted men also indicated similar preferences. Whereas women’s
preferences would be in the service of identifying high-quality short-term partners, men’s
preferences may represent vigilance toward intrasexual competition and subsequent
willingness to confront rivals with similar mating goals (Maner, Gailliott, Rouby, &
Miller, 2007; Maner, Miller, Coyle, & Kaschak, 2014). Independent of STM motives,
however, the costs associated with extraverted men appeared salient through a
downregulated preference for extraverted male faces, which would seem sensible given
perceptions of dominance and masculinity in extraverted male faces (Kramer, Ward, &
King, 2011). Unrestricted women nonetheless prioritize the short-term benefits of such
associations in their decisions over long-term costs. These preferences suggest women,
when shifting their mating priorities to STM and traits most desirable for such relations,
will upregulate their preference for male facial extraversion.
Although men dispositionally interested in STM were vigilant of extraverted male
faces (Brown & Sacco, 2017a), which may translate to aggression, such responses may
not be unilateral. Indeed, men can demonstrate interest for both LTM and STM, but those
without chronic prioritization of such strategies may also not perceive confronting rivals
as an ideal strategy, given links between men’s physical formidability and successfully
enacting promiscuous mating strategies (Boothroyd, Jones, DeBruine, & Perrett, 2008;
Frederick & Haselton, 2007). Thus, temporal activation of STM motives should generally
downregulate preferences for extraverted male faces among men. Furthermore, activation
of such motives should downregulate women’s preference for extraverted female faces in
the service of avoiding their own intrasexual rivals.
Current Research
This dissertation sought to determine the causal link between facially
communicated extraversion and its desirability as a function of mating context. I
experimentally tested how activated mating motives elicit preferences for facial
extraversion or introversion in opposite- and same-sex targets. Given both extraverted
individuals’ interest in STM and heightened physical attractiveness (Lukaszewski &
Roney, 2011; Schmitt & Shackelford, 2008), activating STM motives should heighten
preferences for those who could best facilitate those salient mating goals. Conversely,
such consonant mating goals would likely pose extraverted same-sex individuals as
intrasexual threats, suggesting STM motives would elicit preferences for introverted
same-sex faces (Nettle, 2005). Further, because of the potential for infidelity and
antagonism associated with extraversion (Holden et al., 2014; Nettle, 2005), there should
be an overall preference for introversion when LTM motives are salient. Specifically, I
predict women with activated STM motives will prefer extraverted male faces and
introverted female faces (H ), whereas men with such STM motives will prefer
extraverted female faces and introverted male faces (H ). I also predict both men and
women with activated LTM motives will further prefer introverted male and female faces
more than those primed with STM motives (H ).
Sex differences in preferences should further emerge based on both men’s greater
interest in STM relative to women (Schmitt, 2003) and women’s judiciousness in mate
selection (Haselton & Buss, 2000; Kenrick et al., 1993; Trivers, 1972). Specifically,
STM-primed men’s preference for extraverted female faces will be larger than STM-
primed women’s preference for extraverted male faces (H ). Conversely, LTM-primed
women’s preference for introverted male faces will be larger than men’s preference for
introverted female faces (H ).
Proposed Mediators
I also sought to identify the bases of these preferences. Upon the activation of a
motivational state, individuals subsequently could experience a litany of mentalities to
facilitate goal acquisition, specifically pertaining to mate acquisition and vigilance of
relationship threats. In the acquisition of mates, mating-motivated individuals may
experience sexual arousal to facilitate identification of facial cues connoting sexual
receptivity for a desired relationship (e.g., Maner et al., 2005; Maner et al., 2007). This
posits arousal as potentially facilitating an approach toward mates who would facilitate
their salient mating goals. In fact, previous research indicates that a heightened sex drive
upregulates preferences for sex-typical faces, potentially in the service of motivating
engagement with prospective mates (Lippa, 2006; Welling, Jones, & DeBruine, 2008).
Thus, I predicted LTM-primed individuals’ preference for opposite-sex faces connoting
introversion will be mediated by heightened sexual arousal (H ), whereas STM-primed
6a
individuals’ preference for opposite-sex faces connoting extraversion would be similarly
mediated by arousal (H ). Relatedly, because individuals more oriented toward STM and
6b
LTM would differentially influence endorsement of promiscuous mating strategies (Buss
& Schmitt, 1993; Gangestad & Simpson, 1991), it would logically follow situationally
activating an LTM motivational state would restrict sociosexuality and activating an
STM state would unrestrict sociosexuality. Indeed, previous research suggests variability
in sociosexuality influences individuals’ perceptual acuity toward facial features
connoting sexual receptivity in the service of identifying prospective mates most suited to
satisfying mating goals (e.g., Sacco et al., 2009; Sacco et al., 2012), and that
sociosexuality can be adaptively calibrated for salient goal acquisition on a state level
(Sacco, Young, Brown, Bernstein, & Hugenberg, 2012). Thus, I predicted the effects of
STM motives on opposite-sex extraversion preferences will be mediated by an
unrestricted sociosexuality (H ), whereas LTM-motivated preferences for opposite-sex
7a
introversion will be mediated by a restricted sociosexuality (H ).
7b
Along with heightening interests in mate acquisition, contextual mating motives
may heighten vigilance toward domain-specific threats to mating success. In the service
of identifying and avoiding intrasexual rivals, activated STM motives may subsequently
heighten motivation for intrasexual competition (e.g., Griskevicius et al., 2009; Sundie et
al., 2011). Extraverted individuals’ heightened attractiveness and interest in promiscuity
would implicate them as particularly likely intrasexual rivals, making it adaptive to avoid
them when STM motives are salient. Thus, I hypothesized STM-motivated individuals’
aversion to same-sex extraverted faces would be mediated by heightened intrasexual
competition (H ). Finally, whereas STM-motivated individuals’ vigilance toward
intrasexual rivals would manifest as competition, those in committed relationships may
specifically espouse concern about threats to one’s own pairbond vis-á-vis attractive
rivals and alternatives (e.g., Maner, Gailliot, & Miller, 2009; Plant, Kunstman, & Maner,
2010). This vigilance could manifest as infidelity concerns, particularly from interlopers
who would threaten one’s pairbond. Given that extraverted individuals are particularly
prone to infidelity and the dissolution of relationships in favor of attractive alternatives
(Nettle, 2005), concerns about infidelity could elicit aversion to extraverted faces. Hence,
I hypothesize the effect of LTM motives on a preference for introverted faces of both
sexes would be mediated by infidelity (H ).
CHAPTER II - METHOD
This research was approved by the Institutional Review Board at The University
of Southern Mississippi (Protocol #: 18062905).
Participants
A small-medium effect-size power analysis using G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, &
Lang, 2007) indicated 200 participants would sufficiently detect effects using a 3 × 2 × 2
mixed-model ANOVA (Cohen’s f = 0.13, β = 0.80). I intentionally oversampled and
obtained 284 participants through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (Buhrmester, Kwang, &
Gosling, 2011) who were compensated $0.50 (US) for their participation. Given this
study was interested in heterosexual mate preferences and that it is recommended for
studies using mating primes to consider only those in a window of time in which mating
motives are especially salient (see Brown & Sacco, 2018; Brown, Sacco, & Medlin, in
press; Sundie, Beal, Neuberg, & Kenrick, in press), I limited participation to individuals
between 18-40 years of age and reporting at least some heterosexual attraction. I
excluded 29 participants for indicating having participated distracted (i.e., not immersing
themselves as fully in the mating prime); inclusion of these participants did not influence
results in a meaningful way. This resulted in a final sample of n = 254 (M = 30.69
Age
years, SD = 4.74; 119 men, 135 women; 72.5% White).
Following initial data collection, I thought it prudent to consider the distribution
of participants’ relationship status. This is based on differences between single and paired
individuals’ sensitivity toward facial features connoting heritable fitness in mating
contexts (Lustgraaf & Sacco, 2015; Sacco et al., 2012). A chi-squared analysis
considering men and women who are single and paired indicated that a considerable
asymmetry in these variables, χ²(1, N = 254) = 11.96, p < 0.001. Specifically, there was a
substantially larger number of paired women (n = 86) relative to single women (n = 49).
Although there was more symmetry between men, there were also more single men (n =
69) than paired men (n = 50). Because of this asymmetry, I proceeded with caution in the
subsequent analysis.
Materials
Mating Prime
Mating motives were primed through immersive narratives designed to heighten
domain-specific mating desires (Griskevicius et al., 2007). Primes described same-sex
protagonists (matched to the participants’ sex) from a first-person perspective meeting an
attractive opposite-sex person. Narratives described either a romantic evening with
implications of the encounter being the start of a relationship (LTM; see Appendix A for
example) or a one-night stand (STM; Appendix B). A third control condition tasked
participants with reading about going to a concert with a same-sex friend to elicit an
equivocally positive affective state as the mating primes (Appendix C). Such primes have
previously demonstrated efficacy in heightening sensitivity to discrete facial features
connoting mate quality, particularly limbal rings (Brown & Sacco, 2018), suggesting that
such primes could heighten sensitivity to configural features connoting similar properties.
Manipulation Checks
Following the prime, participants responded to a series of manipulation checks to
determine the extent to which mating-related motivations were activated to determine the
potential basis for extraversion preferences. Aside from the arousal assessment, which
immediately followed the prime, the manipulation checks were presented in random
order.
Arousal
Participants initially responded to four 7-point manipulation check questions
assessing activation of mate acquisition motives (1 = Not at All; 7 = Very Much; α =
0.92). Further, participants also indicated their general affect using another 7-point item
(-3 = Very Negative; 3 = Very Positive; Appendix D), to determine the extent to which
positive affect would be driving the effects.
Sociosexuality
Participants indicated their endorsement to a state assessment of sociosexuality
using the attitude subscale of the Sociosexual Orientation Inventory-Revised (Penke &
Asendorpf, 2008; Appendix E). This subscale utilizes 3 items, operating along 9-point
scales, assessing the extent to which one’s sociosexual attitudes are unrestricted with
higher scores indicating a more unrestricted attitude (1 = Strongly Disagree; 9 = Strongly
Agree; 1 item reverse-scored; α = 0.82).
Intrasexual Competition
Participants indicated the extent to which they felt intrasexually competitive, at a
state level, along five 7-point ad hoc items adapted from a dispositional measure of
individual differences in intrasexual competition (Buunk & Fisher, 2009; Appendix F).
Items assessed whether various aspects of competition were applicable to individuals
with higher scores indicating greater feelings of intrasexual competition (1 = Not at All
Applicable; 7 = Completely Applicable; α = 0.86).
Infidelity Concerns
Participants indicated the extent to which they were concerned about infidelity
along five ad hoc items to measure concerns on a state level (Appendix G). Items
operated on 7-point scales (1 = Not at All; 7 = Very Much; α = 0.72) with higher scores
indicating greater concerns of infidelity.
Extraversion/Introversion Faces
Participants indicated their preferences among male and female face pairs
manipulated to communicate high and low levels of extraversion (Brown & Sacco, 2016;
Appendix H for examples). Faces were 40 unique Caucasian identities including 20 male
and 20 female faces between the ages of 18-40 years, which were morphed with
extraverted and introverted composite face prototypes (Holtzman, 2011). The extraverted
face composites were comprised of the 10 men and 10 women scoring highest in
extraversion from self- and other-reports in personality inventories with introverted
composites being comprised of the 10 men and 10 women who scored lowest in
extraversion. The unique identities were blended with matched-sex composites for
extraversion and introversion for a 50% appearance for both faces, using morphing
software (Morpheus Animation Suite v3.10, 1999).
Participants were presented with each face pair, which were randomized on a
between-participants basis with face position counterbalanced (i.e., left-, right-screen
position). Participants selected the face in each pair they preferred by clicking a
corresponding button under their options in a self-paced task with trials ending after
participants indicate their decisions. Responses indicating preferences for extraversion
were coded as “1” and responses indicating preferences for introversion “0.” Higher
values indicated preferences for extraversion relative to introversion. I calculated the
relative extraverted face preference by summing the frequency of participants’ selection
of an extraverted target and dividing it by the total number of trials, separately for both
male and female targets. Results from 20 trials per stimulus type can accurately reflect
true probability of preference in ipsative scales (Pollet & Little, 2017).
Procedure
Consenting participants initially provided demographic information and were
randomly assigned to one of three priming conditions describing the matched-sex
scenario for that condition (STM, n = 84; LTM, n = 89; Control, n = 82). Participants
then responded to the manipulation check items before completing the face preference
task. Finally, participants were debriefed and receiving a 6-digit redemption code for
compensation (see Appendices I-K for the demographics, informed consent, and
debriefing form).
CHAPTER III - RESULTS
Manipulation Check
To determine the success of our manipulations, I conducted a 2 (Participant Sex:
Male vs. Female) × 3 (Condition: LTM vs. STM vs. Control) factorial MANOVA with
arousal, affect, sociosexuality, intrasexual competition, and infidelity concerns as
dependent variables. Instances in which assumptions of homogeneity of variance were
violated, as evidenced through Levene’s tests of homogeneity, resulted in my use of
Games-Howell tests for post hoc tests. Instances when homogeneity was assumed, I
Arousal
A main effect of Condition emerged, F(2, 249) = 81.39, p < 0.001, η² = 0.395. A
Games-Howell test indicated participants in both the LTM and STM conditions (Ms >
5.25, SDs > 0.96) reported greater arousal than in the Control condition (M = 2.75, SD =
1.83), ps < 0.001, ds > 1.60. No difference emerged for the LTM and STM conditions, p
= 0.694, d = 0.12. Men reported marginally more arousal (M = 4.72, SD = 1.89) than did
women (M = 4.32, SD = 1.99), F(1, 249) = 3.07, p = 0.081, η² = 0.012. No interaction
emerged, F(2, 249) = 1.60, p = 0.203, η² = 0.013.
Affect
A marginally significant main effect of Condition emerged, F(2, 249) = 3.00, p =
0.051, η² = 0.024. Post hoc LSD tests indicated participants in the LTM condition
reported marginally greater positive affect (M = 2.25, SD = 0.92) than in the Control
condition (M = 1.90, SD = 1.23), p = 0.068, d = 0.32; there were no differences between
LTM and STM (M = 2.20, SD = 0.87) or STM and Control, ps > 0.16, ds < 0.30. Neither
the main effect for Sex nor the interaction was significant, Fs > 0.34, ps > 0.340, η²s =
0.390.
Sociosexual Orientation
A main effect of sex emerged, such that men espoused more sociosexually
unrestricted attitudes (M = 5.91, SD = 2.25) than women (M = 4.97, SD = 2.46), F(2, 249)
= 10.48, p = 0.001, η² = 0.040. No effect of condition emerged, F(2, 249) = 0.55, p =
0.577, η² = 0.004. Unexpectedly, effects were qualified by a significant Condition × Sex
interaction, F(2, 249) = 3.37, p = 0.036, η² = 0.026. Simple effects tests indicate no
difference in sociosexually unrestricted attitudes in men based on Condition, F(2, 249) =
1.26, p = 0.286, η² = 0.021. For women, however, a marginally significant main effect
emerged, F(2, 249) = 2.79, p = 0.065, η² = 0.041. A Games-Howell test indicated that
women in the LTM condition (M = 5.61, SD = 2.23) were marginally more sociosexually
unrestricted compared to women in the Control condition (M = 4.47, SD = 2.74), p =
0.078, d = 0.46. No differences emerged for STM (M = 4.77, SD = 2.28) with either
LTM or Control, ps > 0.189, ds < 0.12. These results suggest that the experimental
manipulation marginally elicited an effect in women that in opposition to the predictions.
Intrasexual Competition
A main effect of Condition emerged, F(2, 249) = 6.14, p = 0.002, η² = 0.047. A
Games-Howell test indicated participants in the LTM condition reported greater
intrasexual competition (M = 4.66, SD = 1.43) than in the Control condition (M = 3.91,
SD = 1.48), p = 0.003, d = 0.52, and marginally greater competition than STM (M = 4.15,
SD = 1.57), p = 0.069, d = 0.34. The main effect for Sex and the interaction were not
significant, Fs < 1.80, ps > 0. 160, η²s < 0.013.
Infidelity Concerns
A main effect of Sex indicated women were significantly more concerned about
infidelity (M = 5.60, SD = 1.12) than were men (M = 5.01, SD = 1.05), F(2, 249) = 19.02,
p < 0.001, η² = 0.071. The main effect of Condition and the interaction were not
significant, Fs < 2.00, ps > 0.140, η²s < 0.017.
Primary Analysis
For my primary analysis, I conducted a 2 (Participant Sex: Male vs. Female) × 3
(Condition: LTM vs. STM vs. Control) × 2 (Target Sex: Male vs. Female) mixed-model
ANOVA with repeated factors over the latter factor. Consistent with previous findings
(Brown & Sacco, 2016; 2017a, 2017b; Brown et al., 2019b), a main effect of Target Sex
indicated that participants preferred extraverted female faces (M = 0.57, SD = 0.13) more
than extraverted male faces (M = 0.47, SD = 0.13), F(1, 249) = 68.83, p < 0.001, η² =
0.071. Furthermore, one-sample t-tests indicated that participants categorically preferred
extraverted female faces and introverted male faces, |ts| > 2.70, ps < 0.01, ds > 0.33. No
other main effects or interactions emerged in the data, therefore precluding me from
analyzing this model further, Fs < 1.81, ps > 0.180, η²s < 0.006.

Mediation Analyses
To determine potential mediation pathways between our study variables and
preferences for extraverted faces determined by indirect effects (Rucker, Preacher,
Tormala, & Petty, 2011), I conducted 8 separate moderated mediation analyses, 4 for
both target faces, with condition and target sex as moderators using the Lavaan Package
in R with 5,000 bootstraps (Rosseel, 2012). Specifically, I utilized arousal,
sociosexuality, intrasexual competition, and infidelity concerns as mediators. Contrary to
hypotheses, none of my proposed mediators significantly mediated the link for
preferences of either male or female faces, as evidenced by the confidence intervals in
bivariate correlations between outcome measures.

CHAPTER IV – DISCUSSION
The current experiment provided no support for any of the proposed hypotheses.
That is, the activation of specific mating motives did not influence men and women’s
subsequent preferences for extraverted same- and opposite-sex faces. Despite not
providing support the hypotheses in the primary analysis, analyses of the various
manipulation checks suggest the experimental manipulations may not have sufficiently
activated their intended motivational states. This could have subsequently undermined
the manipulations in further eliciting the specific mentalities that would have facilitated
face preferences (e.g., sociosexuality, intrasexual competition, infidelity concerns).
Despite the various concerns pertaining to the experimental manipulations and
assessments of activated motivational states, the stimuli utilized in this study yielded the
consistent preference demonstrated elsewhere (e.g., Brown & Sacco, 2016, 2017a, 2017b;
Brown, Sacco, & Medlin, 2019b; Sacco & Brown, 2018b). That is, participants preferred
extraverted female faces and downregulated their preference for extraverted male faces,
suggesting that individuals ultimately recognize the signal value connoted through the
stimuli’s facial features. Specifically, whereas extraverted individuals appear sociable
and gregarious, traits that could upregulate general preferences for individuals to engage
affiliative others, the added cue to physical strength and interpersonal dominance
connoted in extraverted male faces could undermine interest in generally affiliating with
them in the service of avoiding potential interpersonal costs of dominant and formidable
conspecifics (Kramer et al., 2011). Specifically, extraverted individuals are especially
interpersonally competitive (Anderson, John, Keltner, & Kring, 2001), which positions
them to engage others confrontationally more than introverted individuals. Because
extraverted men are physically strong (Lukaszewski & Roney, 2011), individuals may
view the costs of associating with extraverted men to outweigh the benefits, whereas such
concerns may not be as salient for women, given physical size asymmetries between men
and women (Lassek & Gaulin, 2009).
Manipulation and Manipulation Checks
Although participants were sufficiently sexually aroused by the mating primes, an
effect consistently found for both LTM and STM primes in previous research (e.g.,
Brown & Sacco, 2018; DiDonato & Jakubiak, 2016; Griskevicius et al., 2007; Sundie et
al., 2011), no differences emerged in sociosexuality for men as a function of condition.
Further, women in the LTM condition reported a marginally more unrestricted
sociosexuality than the STM and control conditions; this effect was in direct opposition
to both the study hypotheses and previous research. This contradictory finding could have
occurred for several reasons. One such reason could have been rooted in that LTM-
primed women could have been strategically endorsing unrestricted sociosexual
strategies momentarily in the service of appearing receptive to men willing to provide
access to resources. That is, STM-primed men are more willing to engage in costly
resource signaling (i.e., conspicuous consumption), which would connote access to
resources desire to women in LTM (Kenrick et al., 1993; Sundie et al., 2011). LTM-
primed women could have reported more unrestricted sociosexual attitudes in the service
of resource acquisition. Although, these women could have been more interested in LTM,
assessing sociosexuality could have been a limiting factor if it were to serve as an
interpersonal signal. Future research could benefit in assessing contextual mate
preferences more directly by asking whether participants’ actual interest in LTM and
STM in a capacity that would ameliorate concerns about espoused sexual interest serving
as an interpersonal signal (e.g., DiDonato & Jakubiak, 2016). Nonetheless, caution is
necessary in future research using these primes to ensure the intended motives are
activated.
Interestingly, and contrary to predictions, intrasexual competition concerns were
highest among LTM-primed participants. Although a necessary component of intrasexual
competition considers pre-emptive confrontation with rivals who could impede mate
acquisition, competition does not necessarily end following acquisition, as evidenced by
a litany of mate retention behaviors to address relationship interlopers (e.g., vigilance of
intrasexual threats; Buss & Shackelford, 1997). The activation of LTM motives could
have elicited such concerns, which would have been indexed by their heightened
concerns about competition. When considering the activation of intrasexual competition
concerns in future research, it could prove advantageous to discern between competition
on the level of acquisition and retention to determine what aspect of competition may
ultimately be driving the effects found in this study.
Along with the manipulation checks yielding a series of unexpected results, the
findings in the main analysis could have reflected the experimental primes themselves.
Although both mating primes provided unique mating situations that explicitly described
different mating contexts (i.e., meeting a stranger vs. start of a relationship), which have
previously demonstrated an ability to differentially elicit behaviors conducive to LTM
and STM success (e.g., conspicuous consumption; Sundie et al., 2011), certain mating-
related behaviors had previously yielded equivocal outcomes that were greater than a
control condition (e.g., blatant benevolence; Griskevicius et al., 2007). At least
concerning the differences emerging in the manipulation checks, this inconsistency in
teasing apart LTM motives from STM could have been a result of the primes not
explicitly stating participants to think about a specific context. Future research could
benefit from more explicit mating primes. For example, on a basic level, individuals
could simply think about having an STM experience or LTM experience (DiDonato &
Jakubiak, 2016), which would subsequently elicit prioritization of traits conducive to
either pairbond. In using a more comprehensive motivational prime that could
specifically elicit contextual motivation, subsequent studies could utilize a mate search
paradigm (e.g., Maner et al., 2007), whereby participants would describe what types of
traits they would find ideal in a partner. To create the necessary nuance for mating
contexts, researchers could then specify the nature of the hypothetical partner as either
long- or short-term.
Nonetheless, the motivational primes did not elicit differences in preferences for
extraverted faces nor were there differences between these primes and the control
condition. Previous research assessing mating-motivated face perception indicates that
mating motives are capable of heightening sensitivity to facial features connoting mate
value and subsequent desires to approach/avoid targets exhibiting such features (e.g.,
Brown & Sacco, 2018). However, previous research typically concerns sensitivity to
these facial cues along scalar measures, whereas the current experiment specifically
utilized an ipsative measure of preference. Despite being able to create proportion scores
in this task, thus creating a continuous outcome, dichotomous choices may not
necessarily possess the psychometric granularity to capture the interest in extraverted
targets. Although sociosexually unrestricted individuals espoused heightened preferences
toward extraverted male faces using ipsative scales (Brown & Sacco, 2017a), it could be
possible sociosexually unrestricted individuals’ chronically heightened interest in STM
could position them as more sensitive to facial features connoting extraversion than those
whose STM interests are activated acutely. Indeed, strategic pluralism positions humans
to utilize both STM and LTM strategies simultaneously to reap an optimum amount of
benefits associated with each strategy (Gangestad & Simpson, 2000), but sociosexually
restricted individuals whose STM motives are activated, for example, may not
necessarily become as sensitive to the presence of cues connoting STM value as are
unrestricted individuals.
Another possibility for the failure of the experimental manipulation could have
been an asymmetry in relationship status among participants. Having continuous access
to a relationship partner would afford individuals mating opportunities and potentially
downregulating interest in promiscuous mating strategies from within the confines of a
committed pairbond (Little, Jones, Penton-Voak, Burt, & Perrett, 2002). Indeed,
sociosexually unrestricted individuals have reduced preferences toward facial features
connoting good genes (e.g., sexual dimorphism, symmetry), but only among those not
currently partnered and particularly among women (e.g., Lustgraaf & Sacco, 2015; Sacco
et al., 2012). The relatively large number of partnered women in the current study could
have had their salient mating goals satisfied prior to the priming of a motivational state,
prime insufficient to motivate a given contextual motive. Given both single women’s
particular sensitivity toward facial features connoting mate value (Sacco et al., 2012) and
an interest in male facial features in STM (Perilloux et al., 2010), it would thus seem
sensible to predict that single women would be especially sensitive to extraverted facial
structures in a given mating context. However, based on sample size recommendations
informed by power analyses (Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2011), the current study
did not have sufficient statistical power for a defensible exploratory analysis. Future
research would benefit from considering either participants whose mating motives are not
currently satisfied (i.e., single participants) exclusively, or collecting a substantially
larger sample to ensure equivocal representation of single and paired respondents, which
could accommodate an analysis with relationship status as a moderator.
Future Directions
Because of the communicative properties of extraverted and introverted faces,
future research would benefit in employing methodologies that focus on perceptions of
the stimuli in capacities that would assess adaptive perceptions and preferences that
would indicate consideration of mating motives without necessarily priming them. First,
future studies could explicitly task participants with indicating which face in each pair
would be more desirable for specific context (e.g., Lyons, Marcinkowska, Helle, &
McGrath, 2015). Within these parameters, it would be sensible to predict that men
(women) would find extraverted female (male) faces as more desirable for STM and
introverted male (female) faces for LTM. However, this task would necessitate the use of
a parallel task to assess perceptions of intrasexual threats. This assessment could occur by
asking which of each face pair would appears more intrasexually threatening or likely to
cheat on their romantic partner, with same-sex extraverted faces being likely to elicit such
a perception. Such perceptions could potentially identify the basis of interpersonal
decisions in a capacity the mating primes could not in the current study. For example,
identifying extraverted faces as intrasexually threatening could assess intrasexual
competition concerns.
When considering scalar measures of extraverted faces, instead of ipsative, it
could also be advantageous to assess the contextual desirability of targets separately.
Specifically, a study could task participants with indicating the extent to which each
version of the opposite-sex targets would seem desirable in both LTM and STM
separately (Brown & Sacco, 2018, 2019; Medlin, Brown, & Sacco, 2018). Along with
identifying preferences for faces, one could directly infer the specific contextual
desirability of each target.
Despite the benefits of explicitly tasking participants with indicating which target
would be more desirable for a given context, the task would nonetheless remain
imbalanced, as participants could not utilize the same measure to assess preference and
aversion for prospective mates and rivals. For the sake of developing an equivocal task
across participants sex, it could be advantageous to consider tasking participants with
indicating with which face they would prefer to interact to contextualize their preferences
in a more ecologically valid capacity (Brown, Sacco, Lolley, & Block, 2017). To
approximate participants’ contextual mating motives, experiments could place
participants in LTM- and STM-specific environments. For example, for STM,
participants could be asked which version of the face would be preferable for an
interaction if one were at a single’s bar, with the implication being that it is a bar where
people attempt to acquire short-term mates (see van Straaten, Engels, Finkenauer, &
Holland, 2008). It would be sensible to predict a preference to interact with extraverted
opposite-sex faces and introverted same-sex faces in such a setting. Conversely,
participants could imagine themselves in a setting with a romantic partner to make LTM
motives salient and be tasked with selecting preferable interaction partners. Given the
potential intrasexual threat posed by extraversion, it would be sensible to predict an LTM
context would elicit preferences for both same- and opposite-sex introversion.
Given that mate preferences and mate choices ultimately remain distinct
constructs (Eastwick & Finkel, 2008, but see Li et al., 2013), the proposed studies may
ultimately be limited in their capacity to infer actual mate choices and rival aversion on a
behavioral level (Montoya, Kershaw, & Prosser, 2018). Along with assessing contextual
desirability and preferences toward mates, research could consider specific attraction-
related behaviors toward prospective mates, including prolonged eye gaze, motivation to
message targets through a dating site, or expressing interest to meet a person. When
considering behaviors toward intrasexual rivals or prospective mates who could be prone
to infidelity, researchers could also consider approach/avoidance tasks (e.g., joysticks,
arm flexion/extension) to determine how such faces influence willingness to (dis)engage
rivals and relational threats (e.g., Maner et al., 2014; Mortensen, Becker, Ackerman,
Neuberg, & Kenrick, 2010).
Conclusion
Despite results not supporting any hypotheses, considering contextual preferences
for facially communicated extraversion could nonetheless prove fruitful after refining
various methodological considerations. Given the different signal value that extraverted
faces continue to exhibit compared to introverted, it would seem sensible to consider
acutely activated mating motives influence subsequent perceptions of such facial
structures. However, it now becomes incumbent upon research identify the best possible
way to identify how these processes occur.
APPENDIX A- LONG-TERM MATING PRIME
Imagine that you’re at home getting ready to go on a first date with a wonderful person
whom you just recently met. Your roommate can sense that you’re excited about the date
and asks about how the two of you met. You think that the story about how you met is
very sweet and romantic, so you decide to tell it to your roommate…
There you are, sitting around on campus after class. It’s a pleasant early spring day, and
you can smell the blooming flowers in the breeze. You have a book open, but you’re not
really reading it. You look around, relaxed and daydreaming. As you watch the people
strolling by in front of you, you notice that everyone seems to be in a particularly good
mood.
From behind you, you hear a voice say: “You don’t look like you’re studying very hard.”
When you turn around, you’re surprised to see a particularly handsome guy whom you
have seen before. In fact, you remember noticing him on the first day of class, when your
eyes locked across the classroom. Since that time, you’ve seen him several times, but
have never had a convenient opportunity to talk with him. Now he is standing right in
front of you, and smiling warmly. “Mind if I join you for a few minutes?” he says.
At first you feel a bit awkward, but as you begin to talk, you realize you feel incredibly
comfortable with him. The two of you discover that you have a lot in common, including
that both of you are currently single. When he hears this, he lights up. Up close, he is
even more attractive than you remember. And he is wonderful to talk to. You find
everything he says somehow fascinating, and you notice that when you talk, he listens
carefully to everything you say.
An hour passes very rapidly, at which point he notices that he’s late for class. He suggests
that maybe he’ll just cut class today, if you still want company. You are only too glad to
prolong the conversation. It is clear that he is enjoying your company immensely. He
suggests that the two of you go grab something to eat. Walking together, you notice that
he’s walking close to you and comfortably touching you on the arm when you say
something that makes him laugh. When he’s around you, your senses are heightened.
Even when his hand touches yours by accident, you feel a tingle and a rush of excitement.
You quickly glance at his eyes, waiting for him to look at yours. When he does, both of
you smile and look away.
You end up in a little restaurant near school, and the two of you sit in a dark romantic
aromas from the kitchen. As the evening goes on, you realize you are having an
absolutely wonderful time with this person, and that he is feeling the same way. The two
of you begin to talk a bit about your personal lives, and you realize that he is an
especially kind and sensitive man who really cares about others. As he talks about his
ambitions, you find yourself imagining what it would be like to be in a relationship with
him. You haven’t felt so comfortable with someone in a long time.
Several more hours go by and the waitress smiles when she mentions that the restaurant
is closing. Apparently, she’s noticed the romantic feelings between the two of you. As he
walks you home, you’re amazed at what has happened in the last few hours. It’s as
though you’re falling in love at first sight. In front of your door, he stops and looks at you
with an intense gaze. You wonder if it would be appropriate to kiss, but nothing happens.
He tells you that he hopes to see you again and your heart just melts. Your hands brush
together, and your heart races as you begin to feel lightheaded. You lean towards one
another and hold each other in a warm and loving embrace. As the evening comes to a
close, you don’t want to let him go, and you are already thinking about the next time
you’ll see him…
After that first wonderful encounter, the two of you have gone out on several more
spectacular dates. During that time, you’ve met his friends and have learned a lot more
about him as a person. You are amazed at what a wonderful man he has turned out to be
and you feel very fortunate that he approached you on that day at school. When your
roommate met him last week, she was amazed at what a great guy he was. She was
certain that you should go after him, which only confirmed your own feelings. At this
point, you are sure that you would like to start a meaningful relationship with this loving
and beautiful man, and you are confident that you can make him feel the same way.
In fact, you’re going to be seeing him again tonight. Although you’ve been out
with him several times, you still get butterflies in your stomach and your heart begins to
race each time before you see him. There’s just something about him that always makes
you feel comfortable and excited. You can’t wait to see him and you know you’re going
to have a great time like you always do when you’re together. You hope that tonight will
be the night when the two of you officially become a couple. As you head out the door,
you are filled with excitement and anticipation…
APPENDIX B- SHORT-TERM MATING PRIME
Imagine that you are on vacation with your friends on a tropical island. It’s the last day of
your trip and you are sitting on the beach on a pleasant summer afternoon, sipping an
exotic drink. The air is warm and pleasant, and you watch the waves as the sun begins to
set. You have a book open, but you’re not really reading it. Instead, you look around,
relaxed and daydreaming. As you watch the people strolling by on the soft sand, you
notice that everyone seems to be in a particularly good mood.
From behind you, you hear a voice say: “Wow, isn’t that the most beautiful sunset you
have ever seen?” When you turn around, you are surprised to see that it’s coming from a
particularly handsome man whom you have seen before. You remember noticing him a
few days earlier at the hotel, when your eyes locked across the lobby. Since that time,
you’ve seen him several times, but you have never had a convenient opportunity to talk
with him. Now he is standing right in front of you, and smiling warmly. “Mind if I join
you for a few minutes?” he says.
At first you feel a bit awkward, but as you begin to talk, you realize that you feel
incredibly comfortable with him. You share your thoughts about your week on the island,
and you are both a little sad that your time in paradise hasn’t been as exciting as you had
hoped. And while you learn that he lives far away from you, it turns out that it’s his last
night on the island as well. Up close, he is even more attractive and charming than you
remember. And he is wonderful to talk to. You find that everything he says is somehow
fascinating, and you notice that when you talk, he listens carefully to everything you say.
An hour passes very rapidly and he notices that he’s late for dinner with his friends. He
suggests that maybe he’ll just skip dinner with them and stay here with you, if you still
want company. After all, he sees them all the time, but the two of you only have one
evening together. You are only too glad to prolong the conversation. It is clear that he is
enjoying your company immensely.
He suggests that the two of you go grab something to eat. Walking together, you notice
that he’s walking close to you and comfortably touching you on the arm when you say
something that makes him laugh. When he’s around you, your senses become heightened.
Even when his hand touches yours by accident, you feel a tingle and a rush of excitement.
You quickly glance at his eyes, waiting for him to look at yours. When he does, both of
you smile and look away. You end up in a little restaurant near the beach, and the two of
you sit in a dark romantic corner in the back. By the candlelight, you notice the pleasant
and soothing aromas from the kitchen. As the evening goes on, you realize you are
having an absolutely wonderful time with this person, and that he is feeling the same
way. The two of you order a dessert together and decide to share it. He suggests that after
dinner, both of you should go for a walk on the beach in the moonlight. You have been
dreaming about someone asking you that very question all week.
As you stroll out onto the sand, he reaches for your hand. You softly squeeze his hand in
yours and your eyes meet once again. It’s a little windy and you get closer to him. His
body feels warm under the stars and you put your head on his bare arm. You can hear that
your heart is beating faster, and you feel excited. The sand feels cool and soft against
your feet. A wave comes crashing on the beach and you both lightly trip and fall as you
try to run away. Sitting in the sand and still holding his hand, you feel the coldness of the
water on your feet. Both of your eyes lock again and your heart feels like it’s about to
stop. As your look at his beautiful face in the moonlight, his hand moves up to caress the
back of your neck. You can feel your hairs begin to tingle. He leans in and the tip of his
nose slowly touches yours as you continue to wander in each other’s gaze. Finally, you
close your eyes and his soft lips slowly touch yours for the first time. Although you know
that you might never see him again, the kiss is filled with passion. Your embrace is
flowing with the kind of desire that you have never felt. You squeeze his body tighter,
and you can feel yourself getting excited as you begin to think of how to make this night
be one of the most memorable of your entire life.
APPENDIX C- CONTROL PRIME
Imagine that it’s Tuesday afternoon during the semester. You’ve been working hard all
week and you’ve been looking forward to this weekend for quite a while. You and one of
your friends have two tickets for a sold-out concert that’s happening tonight. Both of you
have been looking forward to this show for a long time. In fact, you had to bend over
backwards to get the tickets. Your friend has been talking about the concert every day for
weeks now, so you know she’s excited. And although it’s still several hours away, you
can already feel your heart beating a little faster than usual.
As you’re getting ready for the show at home, your friend calls to tell you that she’s
coming over in about an hour. Just so you don’t forget later, you decide to get the tickets
from your drawer. You open your top drawer where you remember leaving them, but
they’re not there. You search a little deeper in the drawer, but they’re not there either.
You stop to take a breath and tell yourself to calm down. You know you put the tickets in
a good place, but where? You start searching through your backpack. Books, folders,
pens, but no tickets. You turn the bag upside down and shake it. Nothing but junk. Now
you start getting worried. What if you lost the tickets? What’s your friend going to think?
In a hurry, you look through the laundry. Maybe they’re in a pocket somewhere? You
find some pieces of paper, but no tickets. You go into your closet and start throwing
things to the floor—no tickets. You’re feeling upset at this point. Your hands start to
shake a little. You think back to when you had the tickets and try to retrace your steps.
You clearly remember putting them in your top drawer, so you search again. You inspect
everything, but there are no tickets in this drawer. You look through your whole room,
but they’re nowhere to be found.
You run to the kitchen and start looking on the counters. You open all the cupboards and
drawers. You have no idea why the tickets would be there, but you need to look
somewhere. In fifteen minutes, your kitchen looks like a disaster area. But still no tickets!
You run out into the driveway. Maybe the tickets fell out somewhere? You look in the
grass, the bushes, underneath cars. But even if they did fall out, they probably wouldn’t
even be there by now. As you walk back inside in complete frustration, you feel as
though you’re ready to pull your hair out. You lost the tickets. And you obviously can’t
go to the show without them.
Suddenly, you hear a knock on the door. Your friend is early, probably because she’s
eager to get going. You can hear her humming outside. What are you going to tell her?
She’ll be crushed. Is there anything you can do? Maybe you should lie? But that probably
won’t solve anything. As you walk toward the door, you get ready to fess up, take the
blame, and hope that everything will be okay. You open the door, ready for the worst.
As you are about to start telling her what happened, she yells “Are you ready?” and pulls
out the two tickets from her back pocket. Your eyes get wide. You grab the tickets from
her hand and fall to your knees. Your friend has the tickets! She’s had them the whole
time. You think back and remember that she wanted to show the tickets to another
person, so she took them the other week. You can’t believe you forgot. You don’t think
you’ve ever felt so relieved in your life. You sit down, shake your head, and put your
hand on your chest. You begin to laugh, wiping the sweat from your forehead. You and
your friend will get to go to the show after all. Things are going to be just fine.
As you try to forget what happened, you’re actually even more thrilled about the
concert than before. Your relief turns into elation. You want to shout to everyone just
how great you feel. It’s as though you just found the winning lottery ticket. You can
appreciate going to the concert even more now, knowing that you were very close to not
going at all. Your friend is dying to get to the show, and her euphoria is contagious. Both
of you run out the door, turn up the stereo, and head off to the most thrilling show of your
lives.

APPENDIX J- INFORMED CONSENT

APPENDIX K- DEBRIEFING
Thank you for participating in today’s research. We hope you found this experience
interesting and enjoyable.
In this study, we were interested in how different types of mating strategies may predict
preferences for extraversion, as communicated by facial features. Previous research
indicates that extraverts are more interested having multiple sexual partners at one time,
which would suggest that they would be ideal in short-term mating contexts but
undesirable in long-term contexts (Schmitt & Shackelford, 2008). In fact, women who
are dispositionally interested in short-term mating prefer extraverted male faces (Brown
& Sacco, 2017). Conversely, introverts are disinterested in such strategies and should
therefore be attractive in a long-term mating context.
How do you know if a face is extraverted or introverted? Holtzman (2011) created a
series of composite faces of individuals who scored high and low in the personality trait.
We merged these faces with faces other individuals to create an extraverted and
introverted of each face and asked you whether you preferred the extravert or the
introverted in each face pair.
Due to the on-going nature of this research, we would like to ask for your cooperation in
not revealing any details of this study to others (e.g. friends, classmates) who might
eventually participate in this study. These details could affect the way they perform in
this experiment, which would adversely affect the nature of our study. If someone does
ask, you can just tell them that you were asked to participate in a study about social
perception, rather than providing specific details about the study.
If you have further questions, please contact the experimenter listed on your consent form
(Mitch Brown, mitchellbrown@usm.edu). Should you be interested in reading research
