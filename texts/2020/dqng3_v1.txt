PERCEPTUAL COMPARISONS MODULATE MEMORY BIASES 2
Abstract
It is well-established that stimulus-specific information in visual working memory (VWM) can be
systematically biased by new perceptual inputs. These memory biases are commonly attributed to
interference that arises when perceptual inputs are physically similar to VWM contents. However,
recent work has suggested that explicitly comparing the similarity between VWM contents and
new perceptual inputs modulates the size of memory biases above and beyond stimulus-driven
effects. Here, we sought to directly investigate this modulation hypothesis by comparing the size
of memory biases following explicit comparisons to those induced when new perceptual inputs
are ignored (Experiment 1) or maintained in VWM alongside target information (Experiment 2).
We found that VWM reports showed larger attraction biases following explicit perceptual
comparisons than when new perceptual inputs were ignored or maintained in VWM. An analysis
of participants’ perceptual comparisons revealed that memory biases were amplified after
perceptual inputs were endorsed as similar—but not dissimilar—to one’s VWM representation.
These patterns were found to persist even after accounting for variability in the physical similarity
between the target and perceptual stimuli across trials, as well as the baseline memory precision
between the distinct task demands. Together, these findings illustrate the causal role of perceptual
comparisons in modulating naturally-occurring memory biases.

Perceptual Comparisons Modulate Memory Biases Induced by New Visual Inputs
Visual working memory (VWM) and perception interact to influence behavior. For example,
VWM content can be used proactively to facilitate visual stability in our dynamic visual
environment (Fischer & Whitney, 2014; Liberman et al., 2014; Kiyonaga et al., 2017; Bae &
Luck, 2019, 2020; Fischer et al., 2020). However, the reciprocal influence of perception on
VWM may not be as beneficial. Visual stimuli that are perceived during the maintenance of a
VWM representation have been shown to systematically distort the representation, even when
the perceived stimuli are irrelevant to ongoing behavior (see Lorenc et al., 2021 for review).
Studies elucidating this perceptual interference effect highlight the role of physical similarity
between mnemonic and perceptual representations in producing memory distortion (Sun et al.,
2017; Teng & Kravitz, 2019). At the neural level, interference caused by physical similarity may
arise from corresponding overlap in the sensory cortex to support VWM maintenance and
perception simultaneously (Rademaker et al., 2019; Teng & Kravitz, 2019). Thus, VWM biases
may occur as natural, stimulus-driven consequences of a dual-functioning sensory system.
However, these stimulus-driven biases may be further modulated by explicitly comparing
VWM representations to perceptual inputs. In a series of recent experiments, Fukuda et al.
(2021) found that VWM biases induced by new perceptual inputs were larger when individuals
explicitly endorsed the percept as being similar rather than dissimilar to their VWM
representation. Critically, the authors were able to show that these similarity-induced memory
biases (SIMB) were selectively dependent on the perceived similarity of the novel percept, such
that larger memory biases following endorsements of similarity than dissimilarity remained even
after the physical similarity between the VWM and percept was matched across trials. This
PERCEPTUAL COMPARISONS MODULATE MEMORY BIASES 4
evidence was used to suggest that explicitly comparing VWM representations to perceptual
inputs causally modulates perceptual interference effects.
Yet, the nature of this ostensible modulation remains unclear. Based on their findings,
Fukuda et al. (2021) posited that endorsing similarity between a VWM and incoming percept
amplifies stimulus-driven biases. However, the authors did not directly compare biases following
perceptual comparisons to those induced by perceptual interference alone. Therefore, SIMB may
occur even in the absence of explicit perceptual comparisons whenever a subjectively similar
percept is perceived. If so, explicit perceptual comparisons may not modulate memory biases,
but instead separate trials where bias occurs (i.e., percepts resulting in “similar” endorsements)
from trials where bias does not occur (i.e., percepts resulting in “dissimilar” endorsements).
Moreover, if differences in memory bias between similar and dissimilar endorsements indeed
reflect causal modulation by explicit perceptual comparisons, this could be equally accomplished
by two distinct mechanisms. As posited by Fukuda et al. (2021), explicitly endorsing similarity
might amplify stimulus-driven biases. Alternatively, explicitly rejecting similarity, or endorsing
dissimilarity, might dampen stimulus-driven biases (c.f., Schacter et al., 2011). This ambiguity
bears considerable weight in determining whether explicit perceptual comparisons can help
preserve VWM fidelity or risk exacerbating VWM distortions.
In the present study, we addressed this issue by manipulating the demand for explicit
perceptual comparisons across multiple tasks. We first compared the size of memory biases
following perceptual comparisons to those observed in a typical perceptual interference
paradigm, where participants are told to ignore the perceptual probe (Experiment 1). However,
since explicit perceptual comparisons render the perceptual probe task-relevant, any observed
bias modulation in Experiment 1 may be attributed to the task-relevance of the perceptual probe.
PERCEPTUAL COMPARISONS MODULATE MEMORY BIASES 5
Therefore, we also conducted a follow-up experiment where we examined the modulatory effect
of perceptual comparisons while preserving the task-relevance of the perceptual probe across
tasks. Specifically, we compared memory biases following perceptual comparisons to those
reported instead when participants remembered the perceptual probe for a subsequent memory
report (Experiment 2, Rademaker et al., 2015). In both experiments, we used an identical delayed
estimation task but varied the instructions for processing the perceptual probe in order to isolate
the effect of task demands themselves. We also assessed the ubiquity of any observed
phenomenon by conducting each experiment twice using familiar (i.e., color) and novel (i.e.,
shape, Li et al., 2020) stimulus spaces.
Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, we assessed the causal role of explicit perceptual comparisons by comparing
memory biases following comparisons to those reported after perceptual inputs were ignored. If
explicit perceptual comparisons modulate VWM biases, we should expect that memory biases
following comparisons will differ from those induced by merely perceiving the novel probe.
Moreover, if perceptual comparisons result in the reliable amplification of memory biases, as
posited by Fukuda et al. (2021), we should find that memory biases following similar—but not
dissimilar—endorsements will be larger than those induced when the probe is perceived but
ignored.
Method
Participants
All participants in the experiment were undergraduate students at the University of Toronto
Mississauga that reported normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and normal color vision.
PERCEPTUAL COMPARISONS MODULATE MEMORY BIASES 6
Each participant provided informed consent in accordance with the procedures approved by the
Research Ethics Board at the University of Toronto.
We conducted a series of planned t-tests and a within-subjects ANOVA with two factors
(i.e., task demand and physical distance between the memory and probe items) to compare the
magnitude of VWM biases across tasks. Given that extant demonstrations of SIMB report
relatively large effect sizes (Fukuda et al., 2021), we anticipated similar effect sizes again here
(Cohen’s d > 0.8; η 2 > 0.16). An a priori power calculation performed with an alpha level of
0.05, statistical power of 0.9, and an average population correlation between the repeated
measures (ρ = 0.50) indicated that we would need 16 subjects to obtain such an effect (Faul et
al., 2007). We doubled this sample size estimate to 32 subjects to ensure that at least 16 data
points were collected in each counterbalancing order (see Procedure section).
We recruited 41 participants in Experiment 1A (color) and 40 participants for Experiment
1B (shape). To extract a reliable measure of memory precision and memory bias, we assessed the
proportion of memory reports made with high confidence in the baseline and experimental
conditions for each participant. This led to the exclusion of five participants that failed to meet
our a priori threshold of at least 15% confident trials in both task conditions (1A: two, 1B: three)
and one participant that did not report any memories confidently in one of the baseline
conditions (1B: one). The remaining participants in the sample reported their memory with high
confidence on more than 70% of baseline and experimental trials in both tasks. Of note, when we
re-conducted our analyses while including the individuals that reported a low number of
confident trials, all of the effects persisted (see Supplementary Material 1). Six other participants
were excluded for not following instructions (1A: one), experimenter error (1A: one), technical
malfunction (1A: two), not finishing the experiment (1A: one), and failing to report any similar
PERCEPTUAL COMPARISONS MODULATE MEMORY BIASES 7
endorsements (1B: one). Data collected from the remaining 34 (24 female, mean age = 19.7
years old) and 35 participants (26 female, mean age = 19.5 years old) in Experiments 1A and 1B,
respectively, were submitted to analysis.
Apparatus and Stimuli
Participants completed the experiment remotely using a personal desktop or laptop computer. To
ensure that experimental conditions were satisfactory, completion of all task procedures was
monitored by researchers in real-time using Zoom video conference software (Zoom Video
Communications Inc., 2016). All stimuli were generated and presented in PsychoPy3 (Peirce,
2007), which was installed and run locally on each participant’s computer.
For the color space, we sampled 360 equally-spaced color values from CIE L*a*b* space
centered at a* = 20 and b* = 38 with a radius of 60. L* was set to 70. The memory and probe
items for a given trial were sampled from this color set and presented as circular color patches at
200 pixels in diameter. A circular color wheel was also created using this set of color values—
such that each color value occupied 1° of the color wheel—and was presented (randomly-
For the shape space, we used a continuous shape space whose circular visual similarity
has been empirically validated (Li et al., 2020). The memory and probe items for a given trial
were sampled from 360 shapes within this stimulus set and presented at 200 x 200 pixels. The
shape wheel for a given trial consisted of 18 equidistant exemplar shapes presented in a circular
Given the online format of our data collection procedure, colors generated in CIE L*a*b*
space were likely rendered with additional variability caused by individual differences in monitor
luminance. This presumed variability acts as an additional source of noise in the data that can

decrease statistical power and limit the precise quantification of effect sizes. However, there
exists both direct and indirect evidence that monitor luminance did not meaningfully contaminate
our results. Firstly, others have directly compared working memory performance between
calibrated and uncalibrated monitors and found consistent results (Bae et al., 2014; Bae et al.,
2015), suggesting that performance variability induced by differences in monitor luminance is
minimal. Second, with sufficient random sampling, variability caused by unequal monitor
luminance is extremely unlikely to produce the systematic response errors that we find in the
present experiments. Lastly, in the present study, we replicated all general findings in color
stimuli and shape stimuli, the latter of which does not have any established dependencies on
monitor luminance.

Procedure
Each participant completed two working memory tasks in a blocked order. The order of task
completion was counterbalanced across participants, such that half of the participants completed
the Compare Task before completing the Ignore Task and the other half of participants
completed the tasks in the reverse order. A separate analysis confirmed no main effects of
counterbalancing order nor any significant interactions between counterbalancing order and task
demands (see Supplementary Material 2). Thus, we collapsed across counterbalancing order in
the analysis below.
For each task, participants performed five blocks of 32 trials that were pseudorandomized
between the baseline and experimental conditions. The compare trial condition only appeared in

task focuses on the use of color stimuli. All procedural differences between color and shape are
explicitly noted.

at the center of the screen for 1000 ms, which participants were instructed to remember as

was presented on a blank screen and participants were instructed to report the memory item.
Using the mouse, participants reported the memory item by clicking on the color wheel. In the
shape tasks, participants were told that the shape wheel consisted of 360 selectable items and that

1A). After selecting, a response probe was displayed at the center of the screen in the selected
color. Participants were then able to use the left and right arrow keys to adjust the response probe
around the circular color space, if necessary, to match what they remembered more precisely.
Once satisfied, they indicated their confidence in the accuracy of their memory report by
pressing one of three keyboard buttons (high confidence, low confidence, guessing). The
accuracy of the memory report was emphasized and was therefore reported without an imposed
time limit.
In each trial of the compare condition, participants completed a perceptual comparison
probe item was presented at the center of the screen for 1000 ms. The novel probe item was
sampled ±30, 60, or 90° away from the memory item in the circular color space. Participants
were instructed to compare the novel probe item to the memory item being retained and judge
whether the novel probe item appeared similar or dissimilar to the memory item. Participants
were told that they would need to remember their similarity judgment for a subsequent report but
should not remember the probe item itself. After another 500-ms blank delay following the offset
of the novel probe item, participants reported the memory item following the same two-step
report procedure described above. After participants indicated their confidence in the accuracy of
their memory report, the number ‘2’ was displayed at the center of a blank screen to indicate that
they should report their similarity judgment made on the novel probe item by pressing the left or
right arrow key (i.e., left for similar, right for dissimilar). The memory item was always reported
before the similarity judgment.
The baseline condition occurred in 25% of trials and the compare condition occurred in
the remaining 75%. Within the compare condition, the physical distance between the memory
PERCEPTUAL COMPARISONS MODULATE MEMORY BIASES 11
and probe items was counterbalanced across the three possible values indicated above (±30, 60,
90°). The direction of offset from the memory item was randomly assigned trial-by-trial.
Ignore Task. The same baseline condition described above occurred in 25% of trials in
the Ignore Task. The remaining 75% of trials were performed in the ignore condition, which was
identical to the compare condition in the Compare Task, with the exception that participants
were instructed to ignore the novel probe item while still maintaining fixation.
Analyses
For every trial, we computed the report error by subtracting the degree value of the memory
report in the circular feature space from that of the original stimulus. We aligned the direction of
report errors across trials such that positive error values indicated memory reports that were in
the direction of the novel probe (signed response errors). The direction of report errors in the
baseline condition was randomly assigned. To quantify the size of the memory bias across trials,
we computed the mean bias magnitude using the mean signed response error for each condition.
A positive bias magnitude indicated a memory bias towards the novel probe item. Memory
precision was calculated by computing the inverse standard deviation (i.e., 1/SD) of the raw
response errors within the baseline condition for each task. For completeness, we report memory
precision across all trials and within high-confidence trials only.
To assess the modulatory role of explicit perceptual comparisons, we matched the
physical distance between the memory and probe items across trials in our analyses to equate all
memory biases that were induced by the physical similarity between items. To do this, for each
participant, we identified the physical probe distances that contained both similar and dissimilar
endorsements across different trials (ambivalent physical distances). For example, if a given
participant made similar and dissimilar endorsements for 30°- and 60°-offset probes, but only
PERCEPTUAL COMPARISONS MODULATE MEMORY BIASES 12
made dissimilar endorsements for 90°-offset probes, 30° and 60° would be considered
ambivalent for that participant, but 90° would not. We then calculated the mean bias magnitude
following similar and dissimilar endorsements separately for each ambivalent distance. In the
above example, we would separately calculate the mean bias magnitude for similar endorsements
at 30°, dissimilar endorsements at 30°, similar endorsements at 60°, and dissimilar endorsements
at 60°. This produced a single point estimate of memory bias for similar and dissimilar
endorsements at each ambivalent distance. We then averaged the mean bias magnitudes for
similar and dissimilar endorsements separately across all ambivalent physical distances. That is,
we averaged together the point estimates of similar bias magnitude across ambivalent distances
and repeated this process for dissimilar endorsements. Together, this process equated all biases
induced by physical similarity and isolated the differences in bias magnitude that could be
reasonably attributed to the perceptual comparison itself. We then used the ambivalent physical
distances identified for a given participant in the Compare Task to repeat this averaging
procedure for the same participant in the Ignore Task.
In order to include as many memory reports as possible for each participant, we did not
place an arbitrary threshold on the number of similar and dissimilar endorsements that were
required for a given physical distance to be considered ambivalent. We confirmed in separate
analyses that none of the results of our ambivalent distance analysis could be attributed to low or
unbalanced numbers of endorsements per ambivalent distance (see Supplementary Material 3).
We report Bayes Factors (BF) in addition to relevant t and F statistics to provide
complementary statistical evidence for our observed effects. BF indicates evidence in favor of
the null hypothesis and BF indicates evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

To report our findings with minimal assumptions, all statistical analyses were performed
with outliers (i.e., memory bias >3SD above/below mean) included. None of the reported results
are changed by removing these outliers.
Results & Discussion
Perceptual comparisons amplify stimulus-driven memory biases
content and perceptual inputs induce reliable memory biases (Fukuda et al., 2021). We also
novel perceptual inputs can induce VWM biases, even in the presumed absence of explicit
perceptual comparisons (see Lorenc et al., 2021 for review).
To test for bias modulation, we conducted a 2 (task demand: compare, ignore) x 3
(physical distance: 30°, 60°, 90°) repeated-measures ANOVA comparing memory biases
between tasks at each physical distance. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found a main effect

Bias amplification is not explained by task differences in memory precision
To ensure that differences in memory bias between tasks could not be explained by
systematic differences in memory quality, we compared memory precision between the baseline
conditions in each task where no probe was presented. We found no differences in memory
precision when measuring across all trials (color: t(33) = 1.30, p = 0.203, Cohen’s d = 0.22, BF
= 2.52; shape: t(34) = 0.31, p = 0.761, Cohen’s d = 0.05, BF = 5.29) and when measuring
across confident trials only (color: t(33) = 0.59, p = 0.560, Cohen’s d = 0.10, BF = 4.63; shape:
t(34) = -0.95, p = 0.350, Cohen’s d = -0.16, BF = 3.64). Thus, differences in memory precision
between tasks were not sufficient in explaining bias modulation.
Bias amplification is driven by perceived similarity, not physical similarity
To determine whether bias modulation stemmed from perceived similarity or
dissimilarity, we computed the size of memory biases following both types of endorsements
separately before comparing them to biases in the Ignore Task. We disentangled any

true even when we constrained the analysis to include only trials where memory reports were
made with high confidence (see Supplementary Material 4). We also confirmed that bias
amplification following similar endorsements reflected a bona fide shift in participants’
responses towards the probe, and not an increase in swap errors (see Supplementary Materials 5-
6). Together, the results of Experiment 1 provide robust evidence that task demands requiring
explicit comparisons between VWM representations and perceptual inputs risk magnifying
naturally-occurring distortions caused by perceptual interference.
1 We noted that evidence favoring a difference between perceived similarity and dissimilarity was smaller in shape
stimuli than color stimuli. We reasoned that this likely occurred because of the additional outlier values in shape,
including two sizable outliers in the dissimilar response bin (= 55.88°, -42.13°) that made for a noisy comparison
between conditions. As noted in our Analyses section, removing these outliers and re-conducting this analysis
drastically increased the effect size of this difference (DM = 4.61°, 95% CI [2.24, 6.97°], t(30) = 3.97, p < 0.001,
Cohen’s d = 0.71, BF = 7.17 x 10).

Experiment 2
To address the possibility that bias modulation in Experiment 1 was determined by the task-
relevance of the probe, we manipulated task demands in Experiment 2 to equate the relevance of
the perceptual probe between tasks (i.e., compare to memory or remember). If bias amplification
in Experiment 1 was determined by perceptual comparisons and not by probe relevance, we
should expect larger memory biases following perceptual comparisons again in Experiment 2.

Each participant provided informed consent in accordance with the procedures approved by the
Research Ethics Board at the University of Toronto.
We recruited 49 participants for Experiment 2A (color) and 50 participants for
Experiment 2B (shape). To extract a reliable measure of memory precision and memory bias, we
again assessed the proportion of memory reports made with high confidence in the baseline and
experimental conditions for each participant. In the Remember Task, confident trials were
operationalized as those in which participants reported both the memory and probe items with
high confidence and did not prioritize the memory item at the expense of the relevant probe. This
assessment led to the exclusion of nine participants who failed to meet the a priori threshold of at
least 15% confident trials in both conditions (2A: four, 2B: five) and three participants who did
not report any memories confidently in one of the baseline conditions (2B: three). The remaining
participants in the sample reported their memory with high confidence on more than 80% and
50% of baseline and experimental trials in the Remember Task and more than 80% and 75% of
PERCEPTUAL COMPARISONS MODULATE MEMORY BIASES 18
baseline and experimental trials of the Compare Task, respectively. Six other participants were
excluded for not following instructions (2B: one), poor overall task performance (memory
precision in baseline condition >3SD below the sample mean; 2A: one), not finishing the
experiment (2A: one, 2B: two), and failing to report any similar endorsements (2B: one). See
Supplementary Material 7 for analyses that include unconfident and poor performing exclusions.
Data collected from the remaining 43 (36 female, mean age = 19.1 years old) and 38 participants
(31 female, mean age = 18.5 years old) in Experiments 2A and 2B, respectively, were subjected
to analysis.
Apparatus and Stimuli
Participants were seated approximately 60cm away from an LCD monitor (refresh rate = 60Hz)
in the laboratory space. All the stimuli were generated and presented in MATLAB using the
Psychophysics Toolbox (Brainard, 1997). The stimulus spaces were identical to Experiment 1.
Procedure
Each participant completed two working memory tasks following the same blocked structure
used in Experiment 1. A separate analysis confirmed no main effects of counterbalancing order
nor any significant interactions between counterbalancing order and task demands (see
Supplementary Material 8). Thus, we again collapsed across the counterbalancing order in the
analysis below.

remember condition, in which participants were instructed to remember the novel probe item as
participants attempted to remember both the memory item and the novel probe item on every
trial. Participants then sequentially reported the memory item and novel probe item following the
same two-step report procedure used in Experiment 1. The memory item was always reported
before the novel probe item.

From here, we again compared memory biases following similar and dissimilar
endorsements to those observed in the Remember Task while controlling for the physical
similarity between the memory and probe items across trials (see Method in Exp. 1). Paired-

Experiment 1, each of the above comparisons persisted when we only included trials where
memory reports were made with high confidence and when we accounted for low or unbalanced
numbers of endorsements in each physical distance condition (see Supplementary Materials 10-
11). We also confirmed again that bias amplification following similar endorsements reflected a
bona fide shift in participants’ responses towards the probe, and not an increase in swap errors
(see Supplementary Material 12-13). These findings corroborate and extend conclusions from
Experiment 1 by demonstrating that explicit perceptual comparisons amplify retroactive VWM
biases that are induced by both relevant and irrelevant perceptual inputs.
General Discussion
In the present study, we address a critical gap in previous work which suggested that explicit
perceptual comparisons amplify VWM biases that are induced by new perceptual inputs (Fukuda
et al., 2021). Specifically, we wanted to determine whether perceptual comparisons indeed
modulate memory biases and, if so, whether this modulation is accomplished via bias
amplification following similar endorsements (Fukuda et al., 2021) or bias dampening following
dissimilar endorsements (c.f., Schacter et al., 2011). We directly compared VWM biases
following perceptual comparisons to those induced when individuals perceived but ignored
PERCEPTUAL COMPARISONS MODULATE MEMORY BIASES 23
perceptual inputs. Our results showed that individuals reported larger memory biases following
perceptual comparisons, but only when they endorsed the perceptual input as being similar to
their memory item. Critically, this modulatory dependence on perceived similarity could not be
equally explained by the physical similarity between items (see Lorenc et al., 2021 for review),
the task-relevance of the perceptual probe, nor the precision of the VWM representation. These
findings are therefore consistent with the view that task demands themselves are responsible for
modulating stimulus-driven biases in VWM representations.
At first pass, the attraction biases observed in the present study may be surprising.
Previous research has shown that VWM representations can exhibit repulsion biases away from
novel inputs and other VWM representations that are maintained simultaneously (Chen et al.,
2019; Bae & Luck, 2017; Golomb, 2015). Some have posited that these opposing biases can be
explained by processing mechanisms that flexibly exaggerate or mitigate featural overlap based
on task goals (Kiyonaga et al., 2017; Chunharas et al., 2019; Scotti et al., 2020). While this
account appears intuitive, it does not seem readily applicable to the findings observed here. In
the present experiments, the participants’ goal was to preserve a fine-grained memory
representation and minimize potential interference by the novel probe. By an adaptive processing
account, we might have expected repulsion biases to occur, especially in the Remember Task,
where simultaneous maintenance may have increased confusability between the two
representations.
Then what factors might be able to unify the myriad of literature investigating VWM
biases? One possibility is that encoding contexts influence the directionality of the bias. A
majority of studies that report repulsion biases in VWM representations present task-relevant
stimuli simultaneously (Golomb, 2015; Chunharas et al., 2019; Scotti et al., 2020), whereas we
PERCEPTUAL COMPARISONS MODULATE MEMORY BIASES 24
observed attraction biases when the stimuli were presented sequentially. The latter is consistent
with a wealth of related studies investigating serial dependence in visual perception, in which
sequential presentation of task-relevant stimuli results in the attraction of current perceptual
inputs towards prior perceptual inputs (Fischer & Whitney, 2014; Liberman et al., 2014;
Kiyonaga et al., 2017; Fischer et al., 2020). It may be the case that the proactive biases induced
during serial perception rely on the same mechanisms responsible for the retroactive biases in
VWM found here.
Some have also shown that shared spatial location at encoding can bias individuals
towards perceiving shared identity between two sequentially-presented visual stimuli (Golomb et
al., 2014). This effect may have contributed to the systematic attraction biases reported here and
the spatial tuning effects observed in serial dependence (Fischer et al., 2020; Bliss et al., 2017;
Fischer & Whitney, 2014; Manassi et al., 2019; Collins, 2019). However, spatial and temporal
encoding contexts are often confounded with one another. During simultaneous presentation of
multiple visual stimuli, manipulations to spatial location are necessarily limited since physical
spatial overlap would require that one stimulus takes perceptual precedent over another. Future
work should therefore seek to clarify the independent and combined contributions of temporal
and spatial encoding contexts towards the repulsion and attraction biases observed across
multiple studies.
A third possibility is that VWM biases are meaningfully influenced by the types of
stimuli that are perceived and remembered. In the present study, we replicated our general
findings between a familiar (i.e., color) and unfamiliar (i.e., shape) type of visual stimulus to
ensure that evidence of bias modulation could not be attributed to reliance on categorical
representations that can induce memory biases without external input (Bae et al., 2015). In doing
PERCEPTUAL COMPARISONS MODULATE MEMORY BIASES 25
so, our findings highlight the forceful nature of perceptual comparisons in outweighing biases
that can be induced by categorical priors. However, it remains an open question as to how
perceptual comparisons might influence highly-familiar stimuli whose underlying feature space
is distorted by the statistical structure of the surrounding environment. For example, previous
studies that have reported repulsion biases between sequentially-presented inputs have primarily
relied on orientation stimuli (Bae & Luck, 2017, 2019, 2020; Bae, 2021; Kang et al., 2011;
Rauber & Treue, 1998). Orientation processing is heavily influenced by biased perceptual
expertise that arises from environmental regularities, such as the ubiquitous occurrence of
vertical and horizontal cardinal orientations (Girshick et al., 2011; Wei & Stocker, 2015, 2017).
It would be useful to elucidate whether perceptual comparisons can induce attraction biases in
remembered orientations as they do in the color and shape stimuli used here.
Taken together, the present findings solidify a causal role of task demands in memory-
perception interactions and support the emerging perspective that perceptual comparisons
represent a general cognitive mechanism that extends to real-world scenarios (Fukuda et al.,
2021). For example, the task demands in the present study are strikingly similar to those present
in eyewitness testimony, where individuals explicitly compare their memory of a perpetrator to
potential suspects (Wixted et al., 2018). The false identification that is commonly described in
these applied scenarios may arise from the same mechanism responsible for VWM biases.
Indeed, repeated biasing of a remembered face by similar-looking faces can potentially explain
why eyewitness identifications tend to become less reliable (but not less confident) with repeated
comparisons (Steblay & Dysart, 2016; Wixted et al., 2016). The present findings should provide
a useful framework for future investigations into the ecological implications of perceptual
comparisons in everyday memory
