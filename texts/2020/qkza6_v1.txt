Increased Extraversion
Increased Sociability I’d like to be more sociable. I get nervous in group settings and can’t think of what to talk about.
Increased Assertiveness I would like to be able to be more outgoing, sociable, and assertive, and less reserved about what I say to people
Increased Energy I would like to more enthusiastic.
Increased Agreeableness*
Increased Compassion Sometimes I do not feel I have enough patience with my children. I would like to change that.
Increase Trust I would like to be more forgiving of people who offend me.
Increased Conscientiousness
Increased Productivity I procrastinate too much.
Increased Responsibility I would really like to change my timeliness. Like, being on time for stuff.
Increased Organization I am very disorganized and careless.
Increased Emotional Stability
Increased Anxiety I get anxious and worry too much, I would like to get that under control without relying on meds
Increased Depression I would like to be more positive minded.

assessed whether desires to change a specific trait predicted actual
change, both in comparison to those without a change goal, and to
those with a goal to change any other trait. We chose to use both
comparison groups in order to help understand the mechanism
of successful (or unsuccessful) personality change. For instance,
individuals with personality change goals may be especially likely
to change relative to someone who is not working on any person-
ality change whatsoever. Alternatively, it may be true that individ-
uals with personality change goals are more likely to change as
compared to someone who has personality change goals but is put-
ting their efforts elsewhere.
3.2.1. Comparisons among those with a specific trait change goal and
those without a change goal
We ran a series of structural equation models (SEMs) to test
whether the desire to change a particular trait, or the dominate
facet(s) for each trait (e.g., sociability for Extraversion, anxiety
and depression for Emotional Stability), predicted actual trait
change in any and all traits, when compared to individuals who
did not report a desire for personality change (see Fig. 1 for a visual
representation of SEM analyses). As indicated in Tables 5a–5d, in
our Internet sample, desired trait change did not predict actual
