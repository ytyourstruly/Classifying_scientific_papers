REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 2
Abstract
Emotion regulation (ER) is integral to well-being and relationship quality. Experimental studies
tend to explore the intrapersonal effects of ER (i.e., impacts of ER on oneself), and leave out the
interpersonal impacts (i.e., the bidirectional impact of ER on the regulator and partner). The ER
strategy expressive suppression shows maladaptive interpersonal and intrapersonal consequences
during distressing conversations. We aimed to explore whether other ER strategies that modify
facial expressions (i.e., expressive dissonance) have similar consequences to suppressing
emotions. We randomly assigned 164 women participants to use expressive dissonance,
expressive suppression, or to naturally express emotions, while engaging in a conversation task
with a confederate. We observed intrapersonal outcomes, including electrodermal activity and
self-reported affect throughout the experiment, and memory performance after. Video coders
unaware of the study goals assessed the conversation on interpersonal qualities (e.g., friendliness
and likeability). There were no differences between conditions on intrapersonal outcomes.
Participants engaging in expressive dissonance, however, were rated more positively, and
participants in the expressive suppression condition were rated more negatively on interpersonal
qualities, relative to the control condition. Although neither strategy appeared to impact the
participant, intrapersonally, both notably influenced the observer’s impression of the participant.

Smiling won’t make you feel better, but it might make people like you more: Interpersonal and
intrapersonal consequences of response-focused emotion regulation strategies
Emotion regulation (ER) involves using strategies to modulate emotional expressions to
meet individual goals or to abide by social norms (e.g., showing happiness when receiving an
undesired gift; Gross, 1998). Emotion regulation strategies can be classified as antecedent-
versus response-focused ER strategies (Gross, 1998). Antecedent-focused ER strategies are used
before an emotion is evoked. Cognitive reappraisal for example, is an antecedent-focused
emotion regulation strategy, which people use to alter their interpretation of a situation and
modify its emotional impacts (e.g., concluding that your friend did not phone you back because
they were sleeping). People use response-focused emotion regulation strategies, in contrast, once
an emotion is already underway, with the goal of altering an emotional output. Expressive
suppression is the most widely studied response-focused ER strategy, and involves inhibiting
outward facial expressions following the start of an affective experience (i.e., displaying a poker
or neutral facial expression; Gross, 1998).
Researchers use experimental designs to measure the impacts of ER strategies, by
manipulating the emotion regulation strategy that participants are asked to engage in when
participating in an emotion-eliciting task (e.g., picture-watching or speech task). Some
researchers have found that using expressive suppression is less helpful than other ER strategies
in terms of intrapersonal outcomes (i.e., effects on oneself); participants who suppress their
expressions tend to experience an increase in sympathetic nervous system arousal, difficulties in
memory accuracy, and decreased self-reported positive mood (see Webb et al., 2012). Moreover,
people with mood and anxiety disorders tend to use suppression inflexibly and more often than
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 4
people without those clinical diagnoses (Aldao et al., 2010), which highlights the potential long-
term disadvantages of frequently using this strategy.
In most experimental studies on ER, researchers measure intrapersonal outcomes of ER
strategies—the impact on oneself—and pay little attention to the interpersonal outcomes of ER
strategies—the impact on others, or on relational dynamics. The process of interpersonal ER
refers to intentionally attempting to alter someone else’s emotional experience or intentionally
engaging someone else in altering our emotional experience (e.g., Niven, 2017; Zaki &
Williams, 2013). However, people’s attempts to regulate their own emotions (rather than the
emotions of others) can also have unintentional social impacts. How do different ER strategies
help or hinder our relationships? How do people perceive us? The quality of our social
interactions may be affected by the emotion regulation strategies that we use (Gross, 1998).
The strategies that people use to regulate their own emotions can impact the quality of
their interpersonal interactions and relationships (Gross & John, 2002). In one meta-analysis of
research focused on emotional expression or suppression and social variables, Chervonsky and
Hunt (2017) found that emotional suppression of any emotion was associated with poorer overall
social wellbeing, including social liking by unacquainted peers. Moreover, these associations
were stronger for women participants than for men, suggesting that the social cost of emotional
suppression may be higher for women. However, the vast majority of studies included in the
meta-analysis were correlational or longitudinal, and relied on participants’ self-report. As such,
it is unclear whether ER strategy use causes specific social outcomes, and whether those
outcomes, as perceived by the self, are similar to those perceived by other social actors.
Experimental designs with behavioural outcomes are vital to understanding the impact of
different ER strategies on social outcomes.
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 5
Although limited, there are a few experimental studies in which researchers examined the
physiological, cognitive, affective, and social consequences of expressive suppression during
social interactions of unacquainted pairs. Butler et al. (2003) recruited unacquainted pairs of
women to discuss an upsetting topic; one partner was given instructions on the strategy to use to
regulate their emotions. Those who suppressed their expressions reported feeling more negative
emotions during the conversation, relative to those who reappraised or received no instructions.
Crucially, suppression was shown to increase blood pressure in both the regulators and their
partners, relative to the other two conditions. The partners of suppressors reported less rapport
and willingness to form a friendship. Peters et al. (2014) asked participants (men and women) to
use either suppression or exaggeration while discussing a negative emotion-eliciting video with
an unacquainted opposite-sex partner. The partners reported that suppressors were poor
communicators and expressed fewer facial expressions, emotions, and gestures. Additionally,
both participants of the suppression dyads exhibited increased sympathetic nervous system
arousal, during the conversation task. Finally, Butler et al. (2008; Studies 1 & 2) found that
participants reported being more likely to help a person (in a vignette, Study 1; a confederate,
Study 2) who expressed feeling a negative emotion compared to people who experienced, but did
not express a negative emotion.
Memory accuracy is also negatively impacted by expressive suppression. Richards and
Gross (2005) found that people who suppressed their expressions while discussing a relationship
conflict with their partner remembered less of the discussion, relative to those who reappraised
or received no specific instructions to regulate. The authors attributed these findings to the
constant self-monitoring of one’s own facial displays, which may distract the regulator from
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 6
his/her partner, reducing their ability to retain or remember pieces of the conversation (Richards
& Gross, 2005).
Taken together, the findings from experimental research suggest that suppression has the
potential to significantly undermine social functioning and relationship quality, via its effects on
communication, psychophysiology, cognition, and affect, among both conversation participants.
Because expressive suppression is a response-focused strategy that may be associated with social
consequences, it is crucial to examine whether other response-focused ER strategies (i.e.,
strategies that modulate facial expressions) lead to similar impacts. Indeed, researchers have
typically categorized response-focused strategies as maladaptive (e.g., Gross, 1998), in that they
counterproductively up-regulate, rather than down-regulate emotional responses. However, there
are social scenarios in which suppressing our emotional expression may actually be socially
beneficial (e.g., suppressing an anger expression in a business meeting). Thus, we need to better
understand social contexts in which it is helpful to regulate (either by suppression or dissonance)
evoked emotions. In a recent review, English and Eldesouky (2020) highlighted the need for
research extending our understanding of how strategies other than expressive suppression lead to
better or worse social outcomes.
Expressive dissonance occurs by displaying the opposite of how one feels (e.g., smiling
when feeling sad). Expressive dissonance represents an incongruency between the emotion felt
and the emotion presented. To our knowledge, only three studies have explored the intrapersonal
impacts of expressive dissonance, specifically, smiling during a stressful task. Robinson and
Demaree (2007) and Pelt et al. (2018) found that relative to a control condition, participants who
engaged in expressive dissonance (i.e., smiling) while watching negative film-clips displayed
greater sympathetic nervous system arousal and performed poorly on a memory task assessing
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 7
social and visual information presented in the film-clips. In our more recent study (Bahl &
Ouimet, 2022), we recruited a relatively large sample of undergraduate women and measured the
intrapersonal impacts of expressive dissonance versus expressive suppression and a control
condition. However, we were unable to replicate the previous findings. Women who used
expressive suppression or expressive dissonance did not differ from each other or from a control
condition on intrapersonal outcomes (i.e., psychophysiology, memory accuracy, and self-
reported affect), while viewing negative emotion-evoking images.
Given that this finding is contrary to the literature on response-focused emotion
regulation, and is one of only three studies looking specifically at the intrapersonal impacts of
expressive dissonance, our conclusions on the potential helpfulness of expressive dissonance
may be premature. Indeed, in the clinical literature, expressive dissonance, particularly smiling
when distressed, has been framed as a helpful distress tolerance skill. The half-smile technique
(i.e., gentle upturn of the lips) is a distress-tolerance skill, developed from research that feedback
from facial expressions influences emotions and emotion-related behaviours (Linehan, 1993).
It is therefore possible that expressive dissonance may be more helpful in regulating
emotions (e.g., decreased psychophysiology and improve self-reported affect) relative to
expressive suppression. Additionally, to our knowledge, no studies have explored the
interpersonal impacts of using expressive dissonance. This gap is unfortunate, given that emotion
regulation strategies have implications not only for individuals, but also for the development and
maintenance of relationships with others (e.g., English & Eldesouky, 2020).
In the current study, we investigated whether expressive dissonance leads to more
positive intrapersonal and interpersonal outcomes than expressive suppression, given the
documented benefits of expressing positive emotions during social interactions (Chervonsky &
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 8
Hunt, 2017). Participants self-identifying as women participated in an unstructured “getting to
know you” task with an unacquainted male confederate. The participants were randomized and
given specific instructions to engage in expressive suppression (i.e., show no expression),
expressive dissonance (i.e., smile throughout the task), or control condition (i.e., express
naturally); they then engaged in an unstructured “getting to know you” task with an unacquainted
male confederate using those instructions. Our main outcomes included repeated measures of
electrodermal activity (EDA) and self-reported affect, and three memory tasks (free recall, cued
recall, and recognition) administered after the task.
We registered our hypotheses, methods, and analysis plan on the Open Science
uploaded our original dataset1 (i.e., before any data cleaning) to OSF. We hypothesized that
participants in the Expressive Suppression condition would show greater sympathetic nervous
system arousal (H1), reduced positive mood (H2), and increased peak anxiety (H3) during the
conversation task, relative to those in the Control condition, who in turn, would show greater
sympathetic nervous system arousal, reduced positive mood, and increased peak anxiety relative
to those in the Expressive Dissonance condition. We also hypothesized that participants in the
experimental conditions would perform worse on memory tasks (i.e., free-recall, cued-recall, and
recognition task), relative to the Control condition (H4). Finally, we hypothesized the judges,
unaware of the study goals, design, or hypotheses, would rate people in the Expressive
Dissonance condition higher and the Expressive Suppression condition lower on interpersonal
qualities (e.g., friendliness), relative to the control condition (H5).

Method2
Participants
All methods and procedures were approved by the Research Ethics Board at the
University of Ottawa (Ontario, Canada) prior to beginning data collection. We recruited 164
women3 participants (M = 18.68 years, SD = 1.96, range 17-32 years) via the participant pool
age
at the university. Participants were required to be fluent in English to participate in the tasks. All
participants were residing in Canada during the time of the experiment. Participants identified
themselves as4 White (59.2%), Black (6.8%), Latinx (4.1%), Asian (12.2%), South Asian
(10.2%), Indigenous (4.1%), Middle Eastern (9.5%) Caribbean (3.4%), European (10.9%), Other
(4.1%), and Preferred not to answer (.70%). All participants identified as women. In regards to
sexual orientation, participants described themselves as heterosexual (86.7%), lesbian (1.2%),
bisexual (5.4%), bicurious (3.0%), unsure (1.2%), and preferred not to answer (.6%). The
majority (95.2%) of participants were full-time students (i.e., 12 credits or more per semester),
whereas 3.0% were part-time students. Most participants (59.0%) were not currently employed,
about 37.3% were employed part-time, and 1.8% were employed full time (i.e., more than 25
hours of paid work per week). Participants reported a household income of more than $80 000
CAD (44.6%), $60 000 – $80 000 CAD (13.3%), $40 000 – $60 000 CAD (14.5%), $20 000 –
$40 000 CAD (7.8%), or less than $20 000 CAD (3.6%). Approximately 8% of participants
reported a past diagnosis of a mood or anxiety disorder. We did not ask participants whether they
lived with other disabilities. Participants were compensated with one course credit.
2 Given the similarity of measures and experimental manipulation used in this study and Bahl and Ouimet (2022),
there is considerable overlap in the text of the Methods sections of these two articles. The two experiments differ in
the behavioural task assigned and the outcomes measured. In Bahl and Ouimet (2022), participants responded to
negative emotion-eliciting images while we measured intrapersonal outcomes only; in the current study participants
completed a conversation task with a confederate, which enabled us to also measure interpersonal outcomes.

Experimental Manipulation
Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: expressive dissonance,
expressive suppression, or control. Participants were then given instructions on the conversation
task:
“I would like you to take part in a conversation with another participant who is
waiting in the other experiment room. Your task is to try to acquaint yourself with
this person, similar to what you may do when meeting someone for the first time.
The conversation will last for at least 10 minutes, and you will be recorded using a
video camera. During the conversation, a judge, who will be watching you two from
the other room, through cameras (point at the camera on the tripod) will be
evaluating you on the following criteria: clarity, interest, content, poise, style, and
management of emotions. The conversation will be video recorded so that a group of
researchers can also rate your conversation on the criteria mentioned at a later date.”
Depending on the condition, participants were given the following instructions (underlined
phrases indicate manipulated portions of instructions):
Expressive Suppression condition (n = 54):
"This task may produce a range of negative feelings, like anxiety. People tend to deal
with these feelings in different ways. For the purposes of this study, it’s extremely
important that you deal with these feelings by not showing any of your emotions
during the conversation. That is, please maintain a straight face so that I or the other
participant will not be able to see that you are feeling anything at all. Remember, do
not show your emotions at any time during this task.";
Expressive Dissonance condition (n = 54):
"This task may produce a range of negative feelings, like anxiety. People tend to deal
with these feelings in different ways. For the purposes of this study, it’s extremely
important that you deal with these feelings by showing happiness during the
conversation. That is, please maintain a natural smile with teeth so that I and the
other participant will be able to see that you are feeling happy. Remember, smile as
often as you can during this task”;
Control condition (n = 54):
"This task may produce a range of negative feelings, like anxiety. People tend to deal
with these feelings in different ways. For the purposes of this study, it’s extremely
important that you deal with these feelings by showing your feelings in any manner
that you wish during the conversation. That is, please behave in such a way that I and
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 11
the other participant might or might not be able to see what you are feeling.
Remember, show your emotions if you wish at any time during this task.”
Conversation and Memory Task
Conversation Task. Participants self-identifying as women participated in an
unstructured “getting to know you” task with an unacquainted male confederate. We selected a
conversation task as the social-evaluative task, given its documented effectiveness creating stress
and enabling observation of interpersonal outcomes within a laboratory setting (e.g., Voncken &
Bögels, 2008). The conversation confederate partners were men, given evidence that opposite-
gender dyads create more objective and subjective levels of anxiety than same-gender dyads
(Mendes et al., 2003). To contribute to a distressing situation, all confederates were trained to act
more “aloof” with minimal emotional expression and to leave the onus of the conversation to the
participant. During silences in the conversation, confederates were instructed to wait
approximately seven seconds before asking a question to the participant, to allow the participant
to fill in the silence. Confederates were also trained to provide five specific pieces of information
(name, university program, career aspiration, birth month, and favourite TV show) throughout
the conversation, which formed the basis of the memory tasks later (of which the participants
were unaware).
To ensure that participants understood the regulation instructions assigned, they were
asked to partake in up to three practice rounds by responding to a question from the experimenter
(e.g., “What is your favourite season and why?”), while engaging in the strategy assigned. The
experimenter was thus able to verify that participants maintained a neutral expression (ES
condition), smiled (ED condition), or expressed emotions naturally (control condition), or
provide feedback until they were able to do so, prior to engaging in the conversation task. The
videos were coded for affective expressions (i.e., positive, negative, neutral expressions) to
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 12
examine whether participants adhered to the emotion regulation strategy assigned (See Data
Preparation section).
Memory Task. Participants completed three memory tasks: free recall, cued recall, and a
multiple-choice recognition task, for information relayed by the confederate during the
conversation. In the free recall task, participants wrote down as many pieces of information
about the confederate as they could recall from the conversation. In the cued recall task,
participants answered five open-ended questions of information presented by the confederate
(i.e., “What was his name; University program; career aspiration; favourite TV show; birth
month”). In the multiple-choice recognition task, participants answered five multiple choice
questions identical to what was asked in the cued-recall task.
Measures
Baseline Questionnaires
Because Aldao et al. (2010) suggest that people with mood and/or anxiety disorders use
expressive suppression more than people without, we included measures of social anxiety (Social
Phobia Inventory: SPIN; Connor et al., 2000) and depression (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-
21 – Depression Subscale: DASS-DEP; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) symptomatology as
covariates in a separate set of our main analyses. We also included measures of ER, to account
for potential condition differences in 1) difficulties with ER (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation
Scale: DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 2004) and 2) degree of specific emotion regulation strategy use
(Emotion Regulation Questionnaire: ERQ; Gross & John, 2003).
Depression Anxiety Stress Scale – Depression Subscale (DASS-DEP; Lovibond &
Lovibond, 1995). The depression subscale of the DASS is a 7-item self-report questionnaire,
which measures depression symptomatology (e.g., “I felt that I had nothing to look forward to”),
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 13
on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = “Did not apply to me at all”, 3 = “Applied to me very much”, or
“most of the time”). The DASS-DEP subscale demonstrates excellent internal consistency (α =
.92; Antony et al., 1998).
Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN; Connor et al., 2000). The SPIN is 17-item self-report
questionnaire, which assesses social anxiety symptoms experienced over the past week, on a 5-
point Likert scale (0 = “Not at all”, 4 = “Extremely”). The SPIN comprises three subscales: fear
(e.g., “I am afraid of people in authority”; 6 items), avoidance, (“I avoid talking to people I don’t
know”; 7 items), and physiological arousal (“Heart palpitations bother me when I am around
people”; 4 items). The SPIN demonstrated good convergent validity, discriminant validity, and
test-retest reliability (.78 ≤ r ≤ .89), and good to excellent internal consistency in people with
social anxiety disorder (.87 ≤ α ≤ .94) and healthy participants (.82 ≤ α ≤ .90; Connor et al.,
2000).
Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 2004). The DERS
is a 36-item self-report questionnaire that measures the degree of emotion dysregulation. The
DERS includes six subscales: Non-acceptance of emotional responses (e.g., “When I’m upset, I
become angry with myself for feeling that way”; 6 items), Difficulties engaging in goal-directed
behaviour (e.g., “When I’m upset, I have difficulty focusing on other things”; 5 items), Impulse
control difficulties (e.g., “When I’m upset, I lose control over my behaviours”; 6 items), Lack of
emotional awareness (e.g., “I care about what I am feeling” [reverse-scored]; 6 items), Limited
access to emotion regulation strategies (e.g., “When I’m upset, it takes me a long time to feel
better”; 8 items), and Lack of emotional clarity (e.g., “I am confused about how I feel”; 5 items).
The items are on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = “Almost never”, 0%-10%, 5 = “Strongly agree”, 91-
100%). The individual subscales and total scale score demonstrated good to excellent internal
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 14
consistency (.80 ≤ α ≤ .93), and the DERS has documented adequate construct and predictive
validity (Gratz & Roemer, 2004).
Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ; Gross & John, 2003). The ERQ measures
people’s use of two emotion regulation strategies: Cognitive Reappraisal (ERQ-REA; e.g.,
“When I want to feel more positive emotion (such as joy or amusement), I change what I’m
thinking about”; 4 items) and Expressive Suppression (ERQ-SUPP; “When I am feeling negative
emotions, I make sure not to express them”; 6 items). The 10-item self-report questionnaire
includes an 8-point Likert scale (0 = “Strongly disagree”, 7 = “Strongly agree”). The ERQ
demonstrated good convergent and discriminant validity; the reappraisal (α = .82) and
suppression (α = .76) subscales demonstrated good and acceptable internal consistency,
respectively (Gross & John, 2003).
To measure the degree to which people engage in expressive dissonance, we added three
items to the ERQ questionnaire (ERQ-DIS) in a previous study (Bahl & Ouimet, 2022): “When I
want to feel less negative emotion (such as sadness or anger), I try to smile in order to feel
happier”; “I control my emotions by expressing the opposite of how I am really feeling (e.g.,
showing happiness when feeling sad)”; “When I want to feel more positive emotion (such as joy
or amusement), I try to smile in order to feel happier.” The ERQ-DIS subscale showed good
internal consistency (α = .82; Bahl & Ouimet, 2022).
Manipulation Check Questionnaire. After the conversation task, participants completed
a 5-item questionnaire (see Supplemental Materials: Appendix C), which assessed the degree to
which they believed they engaged in the ER strategy assigned during the conversation task. If
participants in the experimental conditions reported not consistently engaging in the strategy
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 15
assigned (i.e., a score of 0 = “Not at all”, 1 = “Rarely”, or 2 = “Somewhat”), their data were
considered for exclusion.
Outcome Measures.
To measure self-reported affect, we included 1) the Emotion Experience Scale (see Butler
et al., 2003) to assess positive and negative emotions throughout the experiment (before baseline,
anticipation, conversation task, and recovery task) and 2) the Subjective Units of Distress Scale
(SUDS; Wolpe, 1958) to measure state distress before the conversation task, but after
instructions were given (i.e., anticipatory anxiety) and immediately afterwards, but related to
most anxiety felt during the conversation task (i.e., peak anxiety). To measure sympathetic
nervous system activation, we recorded electrodermal activity (EDA) throughout the study. To
assess for effects of condition on memory, we included a memory task questionnaire.
Emotion Experience Scale. The emotional experience (EE) scale is a 16-item
questionnaire, used in Butler et al. (2003) to assess 8 negative emotions (negative emotion
subscale: anger, anxiety, fear, disgust, sadness, frustration, guilt, shame) and 8 positive emotions
(positive emotion subscale: amusement, happiness, joy, love, interest, excitement, pride,
pleasantness). The questionnaire is rated on an 11-point Likert scale. The Negative (α = .87) and
Positive (α = .78) Emotion scales demonstrated good internal consistency (Butler et al., 2003).
Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS; Wolpe, 1958). The SUDS measures state
distress. It is widely used in behavioural research and therapy to measure feelings of anxiety
(e.g., Milosevic & Radomsky, 2008). Respondents rated the extent to which they felt distressed
on a scale from 0 (“totally relaxed”) to 100 (“highest anxiety/distress that you have ever felt”) by
drawing a line through a visual thermometer. The SUDS correlates with physiological measures
of stress (Thyer et al., 1984).
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 16
Electrodermal Activity (EDA). EDA measures electrical conductance from sweating
(an indicator of sympathetic nervous system arousal; Roy et al., 2012). We collected EDA via a
portable ambulatory device. Two electrodes were placed on the thenar and hypothenar muscles
on the non-dominant palm. The electrodes were Biopac TSD203 transducers filled with Biopac
Skin Conductance Electrode Paste. Data were amplified using Biopac’s GSR100C amplifier
using a gain of 10 Hz and a low-pass filter of 10Hz.
Procedure
The experiment took place in the INSPIRE laboratory, a well-equipped shared
psychophysiology facility at the University of Ottawa. Participants were informed that the aim of
the study was to better understand the relationship between emotions and likeability during a
behavioural task. After the consent process, participants completed the EES, a sociodemographic
measure, and baseline self-report questionnaires (DASS, SPIN, ERQ, and DERS). The
experimenter placed two EDA electrodes onto the participant’s hand, and participants completed
a 3-minute rest (baseline) period. Participants then received instructions on the conversation task,
including the experimental manipulation of emotion regulation instructions (random
assignment).
Participants completed the second EES and the anticipatory SUDS measure. After the
practice round(s), the experimenter brought the confederate into the room. The confederate also
had electrodes on their palm, to provide evidence that they were ‘another participant’. The
experimenter explained that the task was about to begin, and that they could stop the task at any
time by holding up a ‘Stop’ sign, or participate up to 10 minutes. The experimenter then set the
camera and tripod in front of the participant and confederate. Participants were told that the
conversation task was recorded and were falsely informed that the videos would be rated on
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 17
indicators of anxiety (e.g., rate of speech and eye contact) by external judges. The experimenter
then began recording EDA, and turned the camera on. Once the pair said “stop” or when 10
minutes were up, the experimenter returned and escorted the confederate out of the room.
Participants completed the third emotion experience questionnaire and the peak anxiety SUDS,
prior to completing a 3-minute rest (recovery) period. Participants completed the last emotional
experience questionnaire, and then the three memory tasks (one at a time). Finally, participants
completed the manipulation check questionnaire to assess reported adherence to their condition
instructions.
During debriefing, participants completed an additional consent form to include their
data, after learning about the deception. All participants consented to include their data. The
duration of the experiment was approximately 60 minutes.
Data Preparation
Electrodermal activity
We computed EDA in 30-second intervals during the conversation task and 10-second
intervals during the baseline and recovery periods. We took the mean of each interval and then
calculated the average of all intervals.
Video Coding
Emotional Expression. Five women undergraduate volunteers (unaware of the study
goals, design, or hypotheses) were asked to code the conversation task videos for emotion-
expressive behaviours, specifically affective expressions (i.e., positive, negative, neutral
expressions). Volunteers coded facial expressions during utterances (i.e., statements until a turn
of speech – either the confederate jumped in or the affect changed) and sorted them into Positive
Affect (i.e., displays of enjoyment, smiling), Neutral (i.e., neutral facial expression), and
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 18
Negative Affect (comprising internalizing negative affect—displays of fear/anxiety, and
externalizing negative affect—displays of frustration/aggression/anger). Because conversation
length varied between participants, we used proportions to assess frequency of types of facial
expressions and unresponsiveness (i.e., divided the number of positive, negative, or neutral
expressions by the total number of expressions, and divided the number of seconds of
responsiveness by the length of the conversation). Video coders were also asked to record the
number of times participants were non-responsive (i.e., when the confederate finished an
utterance and the participant did not respond in 2 seconds).
Interpersonal Qualities. The five undergraduate volunteers who coded the conversation
task for expressions also coded the videos for social interaction qualities using the Reysen
Likeability Scale (Reysen, 2005). Research assistants rated the participants on friendliness,
likeability, warmth, and approachability on a 7-point Likert scale (“Very strongly disagree” = 0
to “Very strongly agree” = 6). We added an additional characteristic “easy to get along with” –
making it five characteristics.
We calculated interrater reliability for variables measured through video coding using
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for 10% of our videos. The ICC ranged from .19 (poor
reliability for determining negative expressions) to .78 (good reliability for coding positive
expressions). Given the poor reliability of negative expressions, we excluded that variable from
our analyses. We found excellent reliability for unresponsiveness (.97). Across the interpersonal
Memory Task Coding. The memory task was coded by five other raters (three men and
two women volunteers) unaware of the study goals, design, or hypotheses. While watching the
conversation task videos, volunteers coded the memory task questionnaires for number of hits
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 19
(i.e., number of correctly identified statements), number of misses (i.e., number of incorrectly
added statements), and the recall of standardized information (i.e., the five statements presented
by the confederate to everyone).
We calculated an interrater reliability score (using ICC) for the number of hits, misses,
and standardized information, using 10% of our videos. The agreement between hits (.93) and
standardized information (.96) showed excellent reliability. The ICC for misses (.72) had good
reliability.
Manipulation Check
Similar to Bahl and Ouimet (2022), we took a stepped approach to including only
participants who engaged in the appropriate manipulated ER strategy (see percentage
participants (Suppression condition: 26; Dissonance condition; 7) reported in the manipulation
check questionnaire, that they did not engage adequately in the strategy assigned during the
conversation task; thus, we considered their data for exclusion using the videocoding of
emotional expressions. We looked at the proportion of positive or neutral facial expressions that
was determined for each of the 33 participants. Ultimately, we excluded data from two
participants in the suppression and five participants in the dissonance condition as their
proportions of neutral and positive expressions, respectively, were under 0.5.
During debriefing, we asked each participant whether they had any suspicions about the
conversation partner. We excluded data from two participants who reported knowing their
conversation partner was a confederate and another eight participants who withdrew from the
experiment after learning about the conversation task. The final sample size was 147 (ES n = 53,
ED n = 47, Control n = 47).

Analysis Plan
To examine how ER strategies affect psychophysiology (H1), affect (H2 & H3), memory
accuracy (H4), and interpersonal qualities (H5), during a conversation task, we used an
experimental mixed-measures design, with Condition (Expressive Suppression, Expressive
Dissonance, and Control) as the between-participants factor and Time (Baseline, Conversation
task, and Recovery), as the within-participants factor. We used Least Square Difference (LSD)
for pairwise planned comparisons across all analyses.
To measure the impact of condition on sympathetic nervous system arousal (H1: EDA),
we conducted a 3 (condition) x 3 (time: baseline, conversation task, recovery) repeated-measures
ANOVA. To measure the impact of condition on positive and negative emotion (H2: EE
subscales, respectively), we conducted two 3 (condition) x 4 (time: before baseline, anticipation,
conversation task, recovery task) repeated measures ANOVAs. We conducted a second set of
exploratory analyses to measure the effect of condition on psychophysiological arousal and
affect, controlling for social anxiety and depression symptoms. To measure the impact of
condition on self-reported anxiety (H3: SUDS), we conducted a 3 (condition) x 2 time
(anticipation and peak anxiety) repeated measures ANOVA.
To measure the impact of condition on memory (H4), we conducted five one-way
ANOVAs with 1) hits (free recall task), 2) misses (free recall task), 3) standardized information
(free recall task), 4), cued recall, and 5) recognition memory as the dependent variables,
respectively.
We conducted eight one-way ANOVAs to examine the differences in proportions of
positive and neutral facial expressions, unresponsiveness, and differences in interpersonal
qualities (H5) between conditions.

Results
Descriptive Statistics and Baseline Differences.
We assessed for normality for our self-reported measures; the values for skewness (-.49 –
2.0) and kurtosis (-0.85 – 6.6) across self-reported measures did not violate the assumption of
normality (i.e., values did not exceed +/- 3 skewness and +/- 10 kurtosis; Kline, 2008). No
participants (whose data were included in our analyses) had missing data in their self-reported
questionnaires. Participants across conditions did not differ on age or scores on the baseline
number of participants who reported a past diagnosis of a mood or anxiety disorder (χ2 = 4.2, p =
.38).

Participants engaging in dissonance were rated as significantly more friendly, likeable,
warm, and easy-going, than those in the suppression and control conditions, and participants in
the suppression condition were rated as significantly less friendly, likeable, warm, approachable,
conducted exploratory analyses excluding participants who reported a past psychological
disorder diagnosis. Our results were virtually identical to our planned analyses (see
Supplemental Materials: Appendix B).
Discussion
We examined whether using expressive dissonance leads to better intrapersonal (i.e.,
psychophysiology, memory accuracy, self-reported affect – positive and negative mood and
anxiety) and interpersonal (i.e., interpersonal qualities) outcomes than expressive suppression,
among women engaging in a conversation task with an unacquainted male confederate. Although
the conversation task was distressing for all participants (as indicated by EDA and self-report
questionnaires), there was no advantage of one strategy over another or over control for
intrapersonal outcomes. There were, however, important differences on interpersonal outcomes.
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 24
People who used expressive dissonance (i.e., smiling) were rated more positively, and people
who used expressive suppression (i.e., poker face) were rated more negatively, on multiple
interpersonal qualities, relative to those in the control condition.
Our findings suggest that although intentionally showing outward positive emotional
expression, even when one is feeling anxious, may not lead to positive internal outcomes, it may
lead to temporary positive social outcomes. Moreover, the positive and negative interpersonal
consequences of using expressive dissonance and expressive suppression, respectively, are likely
attributable to impressions by others rather than to (in)effective intrapersonal ER. Our findings
contribute to the relationship development literature, which suggests that positive emotion
expression communicates affiliation, leading one to be perceived as approachable and friendly
(Harker & Kelner, 2001).
According to Zaki and Williams’ (2013) model, interpersonal ER involves an 1) extrinsic
interpersonal factor that regulates the perceiver and/or 2) intrinsic interpersonal goal to manage
one’s emotions. Expressive suppression or dissonance did not help regulate one’s emotions,
given our observed lack of effect on intrapersonal factors. It is possible that smiling or neutral
expressions impacted the emotions felt by the observer (i.e., the videocoders), thereby impacting
their judgements of the participant. Notably, Nevin (2017) contends that intention to influence
another person’s emotion is necessary for a behaviour to be considered interpersonal ER.
Although we asked participants to use a specific ER strategy, we gave them no indication that
they should do so to influence the confederate’s emotions. We did suggest they acquaint
themselves to that person similar to what they would usually do, which may have activated
interpersonal ER intentions. Because we used a confederate to increase internal validity and
allow for experimental control for the memory task, we are unable to explore effects on the
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 25
conversation partner. Future research focused on interpersonal ER intentions and conversation
partners’ satisfaction and beliefs around relationship formation may be particularly fruitful.
Additionally, videocoders may have rated participants more favourably when expressing
positive emotion due to the participant’s situation-congruent affect. A getting acquainted/
friendship-forming task is generally a “positive” social situation. Although the task was
distressing for the regulator (as demonstrated by increased EDA and negative affect and reduced
positive affect), expressing positive emotions in a situation that is considered positive by the
observer (who again, was unaware of the study goals or manipulation) may lead to positive
social judgement. Perhaps expressing emotions considered incongruent to the situation (i.e.,
showing a neutral expression during a getting acquainted task) leads to negative ratings on social
variables. This suggestion is consistent with research findings that participants who displayed
affect incongruent with the stimuli (e.g., positive affect in response to negative images) or
neutral affect (i.e., no response to the stimuli), were judged more negatively than those
displaying congruent affect (Szczurek et al., 2012). Additionally, women may be judged
particularly harshly for displaying incongruent affect. Brown et al. (2015) found that women
were rated significantly more negatively than men when showing incongruent affect towards
images. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis found poorer social outcomes for women in relation to
emotion suppression, but no gender differences in relation to emotion expression, suggesting that
affect incongruence may be particularly harmful to women’s social wellbeing (Chervonsky &
Hunt, 2017).
Because we recruited an unselected sample of women, we are unsure whether gender
differences and gender norms impacted the results. According to Hess and Hareli (2015),
gendered display rules outline socially appropriate displays of facial expression, which lead to
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 26
gender differences between the “appropriate” expressions for men and women. Their findings
suggest that women and men both believe women are more expressive than men and that women
smile more than men (Adams et al., 2015; Hess & Hareli, 2015). Nonsmiling women are judged
as experiencing more negative affect than nonsmiling men and perceived more unfavorably than
smiling women (Deutsch et al., 1987). It is therefore unclear whether our findings reflect a
particular bias towards unsmiling women (e.g., as unfriendly) or a universal impact of smiling
during an interpersonal interaction. It is crucial to expand on our work to include men to examine
whether response-focused ER strategies carry the same interpersonal consequences across
genders. Moreover, although our participants reported diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds and
sexual orientations, we did not ask about disabilities other than a diagnosed mood or anxiety
disorder. As such, we cannot generalize our findings beyond diverse undergraduate women.
Our lack of between condition intrapersonal differences aligns with findings from our
previous study (Bahl & Ouimet, 2022), but contrasts with a large body of literature suggesting
that expressive suppression is always maladaptive. Previously, we found that participants used
multiple ER strategies during the stressful task, regardless of condition (Bahl & Ouimet, 2022).
In our current study, 63% of participants in the expressive suppression condition, 77% of the
expressive dissonance condition, and 73% of the control condition reported changing the
interpretation of the task to make it appear less distressing (i.e., cognitive reappraisal; see
We wonder if the lack of intrapersonal differences is attributable to the coactivation of
multiple ER strategies, thereby reducing the effect of the manipulation. This possibility is
consistent with Gross and Thompson (2007), who suggest that people may use multiple
strategies simultaneously. It also raises important questions about the limitations inherent in
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 27
manipulating single ER strategies in experimental research. First, it almost certainly reduces
ecological validity. Second, it likely artificially increases or decreases effect sizes, depending on
which other strategies people use, how they are measured, and the context in which participants
are asked to use them; please see Bahl and Ouimet (2022) for more detail.
Nonetheless, our findings suggest that specific ER strategy use may impair interpersonal
(i.e., relationship building) more so than intrapersonal functioning (i.e., affecting oneself). It
appears that even if people use additional strategies (i.e., cognitive reappraisal, a relatively
healthy ER strategy) to manage distress and anxiety in social situations, the specific expressive
strategy presented holds interpersonal consequences. It is vital that future research focus on
measuring the additive and interactive effects of multiple emotion regulation strategy use on
intrapersonal and interpersonal outcomes.
Additionally, it is possible that to adequately engage in expressive dissonance, one may
have to first suppress their felt emotion and then display or exaggerate the required/assigned
emotion. Indeed, in our manipulation check, over half of participants in the expressive
dissonance condition indicated that they maintained a neutral expression somewhat or very often
during the conversation task. It is therefore possible that our lack of intrapersonal findings is
attributable to an overlap of strategies between the expressive suppression and expressive
dissonance group. Notably, however, neither of the experimental conditions were different from
the control condition, suggesting that neither expressive strategy is advantageous or
disadvantageous in managing felt emotions compared to simply expressing felt emotions as they
occurred.
In conclusion, we examined the interpersonal and intrapersonal consequences of using
expressive dissonance or expressive suppression during a conversation task with an unacquainted
REGULATION STRATEGIES AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES 28
confederate partner. Although there were no differences in intrapersonal consequences (changes
in sympathetic nervous system, memory accuracy, or self-reported affect), we found that people
who engaged in expressive dissonance were rated more positively, and people who used
expressive suppression were rated more negatively in interpersonal characteristics important for
a positive conversation. Our findings suggest that if one’s objective is to build social bonds and
likeability, then expressive dissonance (i.e., smiling) when feeling anxious may facilitate this
goal.
