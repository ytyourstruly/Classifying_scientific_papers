ABSTRACT:
Low agricultural productivity is a major source of poverty in Africa, where much of the
population works in agriculture, yet subsistence production and food insecurity are widespread.
However, some pockets of agriculture in Africa are highly productive. In this paper, we assemble
a geospatial dataset of all pre-colonial African states in existence between 1500 and 1850, and
utilize remote-sensing data based on satellite imagery to show that areas (pixels) in proximity to
the location of pre-colonial state capitals display higher levels of contemporary agricultural
output. This relationship exists across and within countries, agro-ecological zones, and river
basins. We rule out spurious correlation with spatial randomization tests. We argue that via path-
dependence and spatial agglomeration effects, pre-colonial states transmitted the territorial reach
that was critical for state-led agricultural modernization in the twentieth century. The findings
support a growing literature linking contemporary economic development to state capacity
transmitted from pre-colonial political institutions.

1. Introduction
A major source of poverty in Africa is low levels of agricultural productivity. Over 60 percent of
the African population lives in and works in rural areas. Yet subsistence production on
smallholder farms and reliance on traditional technologies like shifting cultivation or low-input
cultivation of unimproved crop varieties are widespread, with adverse consequences for
agricultural productivity, rural incomes, and overall food security.
What explains persistently low levels of agricultural productivity in Africa? The failure of a
“green revolution” – the technological revolution in agricultural productivity that took place
across Asian nations between the 1960s and 1980s – to materialize in postcolonial Africa is a
major puzzle in the study of comparative development. While no consensus exists, existing
explanations often emphasize cultural resistance to adoption of modern agricultural practices or
tropical soils unfavorable to agricultural productivity and the adoption of new technologies (see
e.g. Goody 1980a; Kijima, Otsuka, and Sserunkuuma 2011).
Yet these cultural and ecological arguments are contradicted by the fact that pockets of
agriculture in Africa are highly productive, when governments provide farmers with adequate
access to infrastructure critical for commercial farming like irrigation, marketing and
transportation infrastructure, and a functional agricultural extension bureaucracy (Juma 2015).
The problem we argue, is that governments often lack the “territorial reach” to effectively
provide these services to farmers in rural areas which are far from bureaucratic centers and
which are disconnected from transportation and marketing networks.
The concept of territorial reach was developed to describe differences in the capacity of
bureaucracies to enforce law and order, provide critical services, and more broadly project
official power across territory (see e.g. Giraudy and Luna 2017). Scholarship in the African
context has documented “unevenness” or variation in the territorial reach of African states (e.g.
Boone 2003; Herbst 2014; Roessler 2016). In this paper, we argue that this variation originates
in pre-colonial political institutions and differences across territory in historical exposure to pre-
colonial states. Pre-colonial states generated population centers and administrative structures
which, through agglomeration effects and path dependence, colonial and post-colonial state-
builders tended to expand upon. As a result, the territorial reach of African states in the twentieth
century tended to mirror the spatial extent of pre-colonial states, with important consequences for
long-term agricultural development.
To test the argument, we assemble a geospatial dataset of all pre-colonial African states in
existence between 1500 and 1850, and utilize remote-sensing data based on satellite imagery to
show that areas (pixels) in proximity to the location of pre-colonial states display higher levels of
contemporary agricultural productivity. We define proximity in terms of 25km, 50km, 100km,
and 200km geodesic buffer zones around the historical location of pre-colonial capital cities. We
find that contemporary agricultural productivity displays large improvements with proximity to a
pre-colonial capital city. This relationship exists across and within countries, agro-ecological
zones, and river basins, suggesting that it is not driven by ecological factors. We rule out a
potentially spurious finding of persistence due to spatial auto-correlation by conducting spatial
randomization tests with randomly-generated placebo capital cities.
Looking at mechanisms, drawing on data from Murdock’s (1967) Ethnographic Atlas, we
provide evidence that despite the corrosive effects of centuries of exposure to the trans-Atlantic
slave trade, ethnic groups in proximity to pre-colonial state capitals were more likely to be
organized politically into states at the time of their colonization by European powers at the end
of the nineteenth century. Drawing on remote-sensing data on the density of roads, the spatial
distribution of built-up infrastructure, on distance to markets, and on population density, we
provide evidence that the reach of contemporary states tends to be concentrated around the
locations of pre-colonial capital cities and to decay with distance.
The findings support a growing literature linking contemporary economic development to state
capacity transmitted from pre-colonial political institutions (Herbst 2014; Boone 2003;
Acemoglu and Robinson 2010; Gennaioli and Rainer 2007; Michalopoulos and Papaioannou
2013; Wilfahrt 2018; Lowes et al. 2017). We find that, despite destructive influence of centuries
of the transatlantic slave trade and European imperialism, Africa’s remarkably rich tradition of
pre-colonial states, empires, and kingdoms exerted an important impact on long-term political
and economic development. We provide evidence that the territorial reach of states and
contemporary agricultural productivity mirrors the spatial extent of pre-colonial states, as a result
of the transmission of administrative structures and population centers upon which colonial and
post-colonial regimes built as a result of path dependence and spatial agglomeration effects. In
highlighting these channels, we help to shed light on the mechanisms through which historical
institutions exert long-lasting impacts on economic development (Dell, Lane, and Querubin
2018; Bockstette, Chanda, and Putterman 2002).
The findings also contribute to the literature on the political economy of agriculture and rural
development in Africa. An important literature attributes rural poverty and under-development to
exploitation and excessive taxation by urban-biased elites (see e.g. Bates 2014; Kasara 2007).
These arguments can be seen as theories emphasizing rent-seeking as a primary cause of rural
under-development. By contrast, the findings in this paper highlight a different force: the sheer
absence of meaningful state capacity in many peripheral and remote rural areas. Even rent-
seeking elites have an interest in improving agricultural productivity, if only to improve the
taxable base of economic activity. For example, urban-biased elites successfully implemented
the green revolution in much of Asia. Our findings suggest that an important constraint on
agricultural development in Africa has been the limited territorial reach of states; conversely, in
areas where for historical reasons the state has had the capacity to project authority into rural
areas and provide farmers with critical infrastructure and connectivity to markets, highly
productive agriculture is possible.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. First, we develop the argument about the
impact that pre-colonial states exerted on contemporary agricultural development. Second, we
present spatial analyses based on remote sensing data from satellite imagery. Finally, we
conclude by drawing lessons about the role of pre-colonial political institutions in long-term
political and economic development.
2. Pre-colonial States and Development in Africa
At the time of the so-called “scramble for Africa” in the late nineteenth century, anthropologists
and scholar-bureaucrats developed a narrative about African societies as politically de-
centralized and organized into ethnic tribes ruled by chiefs since time immemorial. A narrative
that provided the basis for the arbitrary partitioning of the continent by colonial powers, and
widespread indirect rule via the institutionalization of local chiefs (Mamdani 2018). In fact,
recent historical, archeological, and anthropological research reveals that Africa had a rich
tradition of centralized pre-colonial states, which spanned the continents many agro-ecological
zones (see e.g. Vansina 1990; Monroe 2013).
Unlike Eurasian states, pre-colonial African states were organized typically not around feudal
control of land, which was abundant in Africa, but around control of people and trade (Goody
1980b; Herbst 2014). However, pre-colonial states in Africa also depended upon intensive
agriculture to feed large population centers. This is evident from the spatial distribution of pre-
colonial states in Africa, which tended to form in areas suitable for agriculture like the savannah
or coastal and riverine areas, and to avoid inhospitable zones like the desert or the interior of the
rainforest. In this paper, we identify a list of over 80 pre-colonial states, defined as centralized
polities with rulers and taxation, in existence between 1500 and 1850, based on a compilation of
location of the capital cities of pre-colonial states on a map of African agro-ecological zones
from the FAO Global Agro-ecological Zones (GAEZ) database.
In a context of land abundance, just like the “mandala” model of state-building found in
Southeast Asia, pre-colonial states in Africa tended to project their power outward from core
areas and capital cities to surrounding territories rather than defend precise territorial boundaries
(Herbst 2014). Therefore, in this paper, we define exposure to pre-colonial states in terms of
proximity to the coordinate of pre-colonial capitals, using geodesic buffer zones with 25km,
50km, 100km, and 200km radiuses. Based on digitization of scholarly maps representing
historical estimates of the approximate territorial boundaries of pre-colonial states and kingdoms,
the “core lands” of pre-colonial states rarely exceeded a 100km radius. To give an example of
approximate core lands and territorial boundaries of the Tio, Kongo, and Loango kingdoms in
the “core lands” of these three kingdoms.
Many pre-colonial states went into decline with exposure to European commercial influence,
missionary activity, and the Atlantic slave trade from the sixteenth century onwards. By the time
of the “scramble for Africa” over thirty of the polities in our database, like the Songhai empire,
had fragmented. Others, like the Kingdom of Kongo, which survived were greatly weakened by
the time of their absorption into European colonial holdings. Despite the decline of pre-colonial
states, and their disappearance as autonomous political entities with European colonialism, did
the historical residue of these pre-colonial states exert an impact on long-term state capacity and
rural development? We argue that they plausibly did so. In a pattern of path-dependence
commonly found in processes of state-building (see e.g. Gerring et al. 2011), colonial powers
often built upon the structures – both institutions and population centers – of pre-colonial states
since this was a more efficient and cost-effective way of administering a territory than building a
bureaucracy from scratch. For similar reasons, post-colonial governments often built upon
colonial institutions and infrastructure.
One mechanism of persistence is institutional. Considerable scholarship documents how
European colonial powers tended to govern Africa “on the cheap”– failing to invest in building
bureaucracy in sparsely settled rural areas because the costs of administration exceeded the
potential revenues (Mamdani 2018; Kohli 2004; Herbst 2014). In this context, pre-colonial states
provided the readymade local administrative architecture through which taxes could be
efficiently collected and paid to colonial governments. Though these pre-colonial polities were
stripped of autonomy with colonization they were often preserved and absorbed into governing
institutions of indirect rule. As these areas became vital zones of tax collection, they also became
relatively more attractive hubs for colonial and post-colonial regimes seeking to maximize tax
revenue to target with public investments, for instance through investments in road-building and
marketing networks.
A second potential mechanism of persistence is demographic. The historical literature
consistently notes a relationship between pre-colonial state formation, agricultural
intensification, and population density (see e.g. Vansina 1990). Pre-colonial states provided the
centralized coordination of earth works, irrigation works, forest clearing, and other ecological
“legibilization” operations required to establish intensive agriculture and food surpluses capable
of supporting large population centers. Pre-colonial states also offered protection to their subjects
against capture by slave traders, mitigating depopulation related to the slave trade. This plausibly
resulted in a lasting legacy of more densely settled and populated zones corresponding to the
territories of pre-colonial states. Greater population density plausibly made it more attractive for
colonial and post-colonial regimes to invest in projecting official power and building tax
collection capacity in a given territorial unit, since a greater number of people also implies a
greater number of potential taxpayers. In a context of agglomeration effects, greater population
density plausibly contributed to economies of scale in economic activity and the provision of
public goods like irrigation, roads, and schools which require a certain level of population
density to be economical. Indeed, the explicit aim of many post-colonial agricultural
modernization campaigns in Africa was to forcibly move farmers from sparsely settled areas to
concentrated villages where modern methods could be disseminated more efficiently (Scott
1998).
To the extent that the power of pre-colonial states radiated outward from capital cities and tended
to decay with the distance, then so too plausibly did the institutional capacity and the population
density that they transmitted to colonial and post-colonial regimes. The implication is that as a
result of these historical influences the territorial reach of contemporary African states exhibited
a pattern of decay with distance from the location of pre-colonial capitals, with important
consequences for long-term agricultural development and contemporary patterns of agricultural
productivity.
3. Spatial Analysis
To test the argument, we link our geospatial database of pre-colonial capital cities to remote-
sensing measures of contemporary agricultural productivity at the pixel level based on satellite
imagery. We estimate spatial regressions of the form:
log(𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 ) = 𝛽 25𝑘𝑚 + 𝛽 50𝑘𝑚 + 𝛽 100𝑘𝑚 + 𝛽 200𝑘𝑚 +
𝑖𝑐𝑏𝑧 1 2 3 4
𝑐 𝑏 𝑧
∑ 𝛾 𝐼 + ∑ 𝛿 𝐼 + ∑ 𝜁 𝐼 + 𝜀 .
𝑐 𝑐 𝑖𝑐𝑏𝑧 𝑏 𝑏 𝑖𝑐𝑏𝑧 𝑧 𝑧 𝑖𝑐𝑏𝑧 𝑖𝑐𝑏𝑧
In this equation the outcome variable log(𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡 ) represents the natural log of total
𝑖𝑐𝑏𝑧
agricultural output in pixel i, country c, river basin b, and agro-ecological zone z on the continent
of Africa. Our measure of agricultural output comes from the widely used IFPRI Spatial
Allocation Model (SPAM 2010 v1.0) dataset, which uses a combination of satellite imagery and
official statistics on country-level and province-level administrative data on total crop production
to assign estimates of agricultural output measured in international dollars to pixels at a 5 arc-
minute resolution (where each pixel represents approximately 56km for the year 2010. A
documentation can be found in (Yu et al. 2020). In brief, the SPAM database obtains satellite
imagery-based estimates of land cover across pixels, exploiting the fact that different types of
land cover (e.g. water bodies, forest, cropland, irrigated land, etc.) reflect solar radiation
differently. It then utilizes a statistical model to assign national or provincial crop production
totals across pixels. While these pixel-level estimates are characterized by measurement error,
our assumption is that this error is independent of proximity to a pre-colonial capital. We take
the natural log of the outcome variable so that the coefficients on all explanatory variables have a
productivity in Africa.
The explanatory variables of interest are indicator variables which take a value of one if a pixel
falls within a 25km, 50km, 100km, and 200km radius buffer zone, respectively, around the
location of any pre-colonial city in the dataset, and a zero otherwise. These dummy variables are
non-exclusive so that they must be summed to compute the marginal effect of different levels of
proximity to a pre-colonial capital. For example, represents the impact of going from a pixel
beyond 200km distance from any pre-colonial capital to a pixel between 100km and 200km
distance from a pre-colonial capital. The sum represents the impact of going from a pixel
𝛽 + 𝛽
4 3
beyond 200km distance from any pre-colonial capital to a pixel between 50-100km distance
from a pre-colonial capital. The sum represents the impact of going from a pixel
𝛽 + 𝛽 + 𝛽
4 3 2
beyond 200km distance from any pre-colonial capital to a pixel between 25-50km distance from
a pre-colonial capital. The sum represents the impact of going from a pixel
𝛽 + 𝛽 + 𝛽 + 𝛽
4 3 2 1
beyond 200km distance from any pre-colonial capital to a pixel between 0-25km distance from a
pre-colonial capital.
In all specifications, we control for pixel-level variables representing average annual rainfall in
millimeters, a terrain slope index (measuring hilliness), and the length in days of the annual
growing season. Each of these variables comes from raster files in the FAO GAEZ (v 3.0)
database. Depending on the specification, we also control for country fixed effects,
𝑐 𝑏 𝑧
∑ 𝛾 𝐼 , river basin fixed effects, ∑ 𝛿 𝐼 , agro-ecological zone fixed effects, ∑ 𝜁 𝐼 , or
𝑐 𝑐 𝑖𝑐𝑏𝑧 𝑏 𝑏 𝑖𝑐𝑏𝑧 𝑧 𝑧 𝑖𝑐𝑏𝑧
all three fixed effects simultaneously. There are fifty major countries in the dataset, as well as 25
major river basins and 16 agro-ecological zones. Controlling for river basin (or country or
agroecological zone) fixed effects ensures that only comparisons between pixels with more, or
less proximity to a pre-colonial capital within the same river basin (or country or agroecological
zone) drive the estimates. Controlling for these variables helps to ensure that potential
confounding variables related to ecology do not drive estimates. We also estimate standard errors
adjusted for three-way clustering within countries, river basins, and agro-ecological zones in all
specifications to address potential spatial auto-correlation.
contemporary agricultural productivity for all crops. The positive coefficients in the baseline
specification without any fixed effects suggests that contemporary agricultural productivity
improves with proximity to a pre-colonial capital city. While the coefficients from all of the
specifications tell a similar story, we focus on our preferred specification in column (5) which
includes all three of the agro-ecological zone, river basin, and country fixed effects. These help
to ensure that unobserved ecological differences, for instance, between the desert and the
savannah, or between the Congo river basin and the Nile river basin, or between Kenya and
Nigeria, do not confound the estimates.
The coefficients in column (5) imply that going from pixels more than 200km away from any
pre-colonial capital to pixels located within a 100-200km buffer zone around a pre-colonial
capital is associated with a 180 percent improvement in the value of total agricultural output in a
pixel. Going from pixels more than 200km away from any pre-colonial capital to pixels located
within a 50-100km buffer zone is associated with a 247 percent improvement in total agricultural
output. Going from pixels more than 200km away from any pre-colonial capital to pixels located
within a 25-50km buffer zone is associated with a 287 percent improvement in agricultural
output. Going from pixels more than 200km away from any pre-colonial capital to pixels located
within a 0-25km buffer zone is associated with an over 300 percent improvement in agricultural
output. Panel B focuses on estimated measures of output for food crops alone while panel C
focuses on measures of output for non-food crops. We depict the marginal effect of different
levels of proximity to a pre-colonial capital city on total agricultural output as well as for food
By controlling for a range of confounding variables related to ecological suitability for
agriculture, we have helped to rule out the concern that ecological differences drive the result.
But could the finding of persistent effects of proximity to a pre-colonial kingdom on
contemporary agricultural output also be a spurious correlation arising from regressing two
spatially correlated variables against one another? This is an important concern in historical
research. In our context, both the spatial distribution of pre-colonial states as well as agricultural
productivity display spatial auto-correlation, which we have sought to address statistically with
standard errors clustered at the level of countries, river basins, and agro-ecological zones.
However, these parametric approaches can fail for a number of reasons, including clustering
standard errors at the incorrect level of aggregation (Barrios et al. 2012).
To address this, we conduct non-parametric tests of statistical significance using spatial
randomization tests. To perform these tests, we generate samples of placebo capital cities by
randomly generating coordinates (equal in number to the number of true pre-colonial capitals)
and re-estimate our regression models with these placebo datasets many times to generate a
distribution of placebo estimates against which estimates based on the location of true pre-
colonial capitals can be compared. We can compute p-values from these distributions by
computing the share of placebo estimates larger than the estimates based on the location of true
pre-colonial capitals.
In one version of the procedure, we randomly generate capitals from across the African
continent. In another version of this analysis, designed to mimic the spatial distribution of true
pre-colonial capitals, we conduct a stratified random selection of placebo coordinates within
river basins, so that the distribution of placebo capitals across river basins is the same as that of
true capital cities in panel A and an example of randomly generated placebo capitals in panel B.
random generation of placebo capitals, we find that it is extremely unlikely that we arrive at our
estimates by chance due to the spatial structure of the data, with non-parametric p-values that
tend to be smaller than those obtained parametrically.
How does contemporary agricultural productivity display large improvements with proximity to
a pre-colonial capital city? There are two mechanisms. Proximity could improve agricultural
output on the extensive margin by leading to improvements in the share of land within a pixel
allocated to cropland. Proximity could also improve agricultural output on the intensive margin
by improving the productivity of land with improved usage of inputs and modern techniques and
possibilities. Panel A reveals that pixels in greater proximity to pre-colonial capitals are
characterized by large improvements in the share of allocated cropland (based on remote-sensing
data). In Panels B and C, we explore whether this is driven by an expansion of rainfed or
irrigated cropland; there is evidence for both, with no aggregate change in the share of cropland
that is irrigated.
Together the results indicate that proximity to a pre-colonial capital primarily improves
agricultural output on the extensive margin, improving the share of land that is dedicated to
agriculture and only modestly improving the technologies that are applied to the land. This is
reflected in the estimates in Panel D, where we compute a measure of per hectare productivity,
which can be thought of as a measure of how intensively a fixed plot of land is cultivated. These
depict the marginal effect of proximity to a pre-colonial capital on the intensive and extensive
margins of agricultural output. These results indicating that proximity is associated with
improvements in agricultural output on the extensive margin are potentially consistent with
improved state territorial reach in areas in proximity to a pre-colonial state, since enforcement of
property rights, investment in roads, storage and transportation infrastructure, and access to
markets are all factors which contribute to the expansion of cropland beyond smallholder
subsistence plots.
How did pre-colonial states transmit territorial reach to colonial and post-colonial regimes?
Evidence of institutional persistence must be provided to understand this. As a first step, we
provide evidence that ethnic groups in proximity to any pre-colonial state in existence between
1500 and 1850 were still more likely to be organized politically into states at the time of their
colonization by European power at the end of the nineteenth century. To measure political
organization at the time of colonization we rely on the Ethnographic Atlas published by
Murdock (1967), which divides the African continent into spatially contiguous “ethnic
homelands” and classifies each ethnic group’s form of political organization at the time of
colonization as a “large state”, “small state”, “large chiefdom”, “petty chiefdom” or “acephalous
society” (for an analysis of this data see e.g. Michalopoulos and Papaioannou 2013).
organization at the time of colonization, where we assign to each pixel the form of political
organization of the ethnic group whose boundaries within the pixel falls. To address the
multiplication of multiple pixels which take the same value within ethnic homelands, we
additionally adjust standard errors for clustering within ethnic homelands in this analysis. Panel
A looks at the impact on state-based political organization. Our preferred specification in column
(5) suggests that going from pixels more than 200km away from any pre-colonial capital to
pixels located within a 100-200km buffer zone is associated with a 12.7 percentage point
improvement in the probability of state-based political organization at the time of colonization.
Going from pixels more than 200km away from any pre-colonial capital to pixels located within
a 50-100km buffer zone is associated with a 24.5 percentage point improvement in the
probability of state-based political organization at the time of colonization. Going from pixels
more than 200km away from any pre-colonial capital to pixels located within a 25-50km buffer
zone is associated with a 30-percentage point improvement in the probability of state-based
political organization at the time of colonization. Going from pixels more than 200km away from
any pre-colonial capital to pixels located within a 25-50km buffer zone is associated with a 33.5
percentage point improvement in the probability of state-based political organization at the time
of colonization.
By contrast, we find no evidence that proximity to any pre-colonial state increased the
probability of chiefdom-based political organization at the time of colonization, challenging the
idea that chiefdoms can be thought of as an intermediate form of political centralization on the
path to state-based organization. There appears to be a modest, positive association between
proximity to any pre-colonial state and acephalous societies at the time of colonization, likely in
some areas where pre-colonial states experienced severe fragmentation and decline. We display
administrative structures generated by pre-colonial states in our database persisted at least
through the time of colonization by European powers, plausibly transmitting administrative and
taxation structure upon which colonial regimes built, and shaping the territorial reach of colonial
regimes.
Did these patterns of state territorial reach that improved with proximity to pre-colonial capitals
and decayed with distance persist to the twentieth century? To empirically measure the territorial
reach of contemporary African states, we rely on remote-sensing measures of physical
infrastructure, including pixel-level estimates of the density of roads (length of road in
kilometers/square kilometer of land), which comes from the GRIP global roads database (Meijer
et al. 2018), as well as pixel level estimates of the percentage of built-up land (buildings, paved
roads, and other cement structures), which comes from the FAO GAEZ database for the year
2000. To study connectivity to marketing networks, we also look at a pixel-level estimate of the
approximate travel time in hours to the nearest market, which also comes from the FAO GAEZ
database. To study the persistence of pre-colonial population centers through spatial
agglomeration effects, we utilize the Gridded Population of the World (GPW) dataset, which
provides estimates of people per square kilometer for the year 2010. We regress each of these
variables on the indicator of proximity to any pre-colonial state capital in existence between
Across outcome variables, we find evidence that the reach of the state plausibly improves with
proximity to a pre-colonial capital. Panel A examines the impact of proximity to a pre-colonial
state capital on road density. The estimates in the preferred specification in column (5) reveal a
pattern of modest improvements in road density up to a buffer zone of 50 kilometers, followed
by a massive increase within a 25 kilometer buffer zone, plausibly corresponding the presence of
contemporary states which formed in the vicinity of pre-colonial states due to agglomeration
effects. Panel B examines the impact on built-up area, which also displays a pattern of improved
infrastructure coverage with proximity to a pre-colonial capital, and which shows a particularly
large increase within a buffer zone of 25 kilometers. Panel C explores the impact on connectivity
to marketing networks as measured by an estimate of travel time to the nearest market in hours.
Here too, farmers benefit from improving connectivity (travel time to market falls) the closer
they are in proximity to a pre-colonial capital. Panel D explores the impact on population
density. The results suggest that, plausibly as a result of agglomeration effects that concentrated
public investment and population growth around population centers established by pre-colonial
states, pixels in proximity to pre-colonial capitals display higher levels of population density,
displays computes marginal effects.
4. Conclusion
In this paper, we sought to understand the problem of low levels of agricultural productivity – a
major source of poverty and food insecurity. We assembled a geospatial dataset of all pre-
colonial African states in existence between 1500 and 1850, and utilized remote-sensing data
based on satellite imagery to show that areas (pixels) in proximity to the location of pre-colonial
capitals display higher levels of contemporary agricultural output. We argued that pre-colonial
states transmitted administrative structures and population centers upon which colonial and post-
colonial regimes built, as reflected in the concentration of contemporary territorial reach and
agricultural productivity around pre-colonial capitals.
The findings highlight how pre-colonial political institutions, by shaping the colonial and post-
colonial projects of state-building, shape long-term political and economic development. In this
paper, we have highlighted as particularly important how the territorial reach of contemporary
states or their ability to enforce law and order, provide critical services, and project official
authority across territory tends to mirror the spatial extent of pre-colonial states. Pre-colonial
institutions and historical states could also plausibly shape other aspects of contemporary states
and societies and further empirical work on different potential channels would be a valuable
avenue for further inquiry.
The findings also speak to a puzzle in the study of comparative development: the failure of a
“green revolution” to materialize in postcolonial Africa. In Asia, colonial power preserved and
built upon the administrative structure of highly centralized “hydraulic empires”, a source of
institutional continuity which provided the administrative infrastructure and territorial reach that
colonial and post-colonial regimes needed to successfully broadcast power throughout the
countryside and modernize agriculture. In contrast, centuries of the transatlantic slave trade and
European commercial imperialism destroyed Africa’s rich tradition of pre-colonial states and the
degree of institutional continuity between pre-colonial political traditions, and colonial and post-
colonial states was far weaker (Engelbart 2002), leaving contemporary states in a far weaker
position in terms of their ability to penetrate the countryside and successfully conduct
agricultural modernization.
Even in this institutionally destructive context, the administrative structures and population
centers that pre-colonial states in Africa left behind continue to exert a positive influence on
contemporary state capacity and agricultural development. This is evidence in contemporary
patterns of agricultural output. An interesting avenue for future research would be to explore
whether other indicators of rural development, perhaps measured through satellite imagery,
display a similar pattern.

Notes: Unit of analysis is pixels (5 5 arc-minute resolution or approximately 56 km ) on African continent,
masking inland water bodies. Outcome is the natural log of total agricultural output (for all crops, food crops,
and non-food crops, respectively) within each pixel based on estimates from remote-sensing data. Explanatory
variables are dummy variables for whether a pixel is located within a 25km, 50km, 100km or 200km) radius
around the location of any pre-colonial capital city in the database. The dummy variables are non-exclusive so
that dummy variables must be added to compute marginal impacts (for example the marginal impact of falling
within a 25km radius around a pre-colonial capital city is computed by taking the sum of the coefficients on
the within- 25km, 50km, 100km, and 200km radius dummies). Specifications include, respectively, either no
fixed effects, agro-ecological zone fixed effects, river basin fixed effects, country fixed effects, or all three. All
specifications control for a terrain slope index, average annual precipitation, and the length of the annual
growing period. Standard errors adjusted for three-way clustering within agro-ecological zones, river basins,

(mirroring the distribution of true pre-colonial capitals across river basins) in columns (4)-(6). A regression of
agricultural output on proximity to these placebo capitals is performed, controlling for agroecological zone,
river basin, and country fixed effects. The spatial randomization procedure is repeated 1000 times to generate
a distribution of placebo coefficients, from which non-parametric p-values can be computed (the percentage
of placebo estimates larger than the estimates based on the true location of pre-colonial capitals). p 0.1;

Notes: Unit of analysis is pixels (5 5 arc-minute resolution or approximately 56 km ) on African continent,
masking inland water bodies. Explanatory variables are dummy variables for whether a pixel is located within
a 25km, 50km, 100km or 200km) radius around the location of any pre-colonial capital city in the database.
Specifications include, respectively, either no fixed effects, agro-ecological zone fixed effects, river basin fixed
effects, country fixed effects, or all three. All specifications control for a terrain slope index, average annual
precipitation, and the length of the annual growing period. Standard errors adjusted for three-way clustering

Notes: Plot depicts marginal impact of different levels of proximity to a pre-colonial capital on the extensive
and intesive margins of contemporary agricultural productivity, in specification including all three of agro-
ecological zone, river basin, and country fixed effects plus controls for terrain slope index, average annual
precipitation, and the length of the annual growing period. Standard errors adjusted for three-way cluster-
ing within agro-ecological zones, river basins, and countries. Vertical bars represent 95 percent confidence
intervals.
