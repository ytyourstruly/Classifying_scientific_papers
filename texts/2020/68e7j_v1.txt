SWIPE KINEMATICS DURING SMART TABLET GAMEPLAY
1 ABSTRACT
3 The motor system is becoming increasingly recognized as an important site of disruptions in
4 autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the precise nature of this motor disruption remains
5 unclear with some conflicted reports between papers. A bottleneck in kinematic studies of children
6 with ASD has been the use of laboratory-based motion tracking systems and experimental
7 paradigms that require didactic instructions. Thus, we employed an attractive smart tablet
8 gameplay methodology to engage children’s interest without complicated verbal instruction.
9 Children’s movements on the touch screen were recorded as they engaged in gameplay of their
10 own volition, enabling improved ecological validity in data capture. Swipe kinematics were
11 computed from two games that afforded goal-directed and free-style scribbling, respectively. 82
12 children aged 2-6 years were tested, including 37 children with ASD and 45 typically developing
13 (TD) children. Kinematic analyses revealed significant age, group, and task differences. In
14 comparison to aged-matched TD children, children with ASD under 5 years old performed faster
15 goal-directed movements, whereas those over 5 years old performed slower goal-directed
16 movements. In contrast, children with ASD moved faster than TD children irrespective of age
17 during creative scribbling. Interestingly, movement speed increased with age in TD children in
18 both game contexts, likely due to motor skill and confidence development, but this was not true
19 for children with ASD, who moved slower in the case of goal-directed swipes or with no difference
20 in the case of creative scribbling. These findings support emerging evidence for differences in
21 maturation of visuomotor integration in preschool children with ASD.

1 LAY SUMMARY
2 This study analyzed the touch trajectories on a smart tablet screen of young children aged 2-6 years
3 during their gameplay, and the results demonstrated significant motor differences between children
4 with and without autism. The motor differences were also found related to age and task type. Motor
5 signatures could be captured at early ages, with careful considerations of age levels and activity
6 types, this approach may assist in early diagnosis and intervention for children with autism.
SWIPE KINEMATICS DURING SMART TABLET GAMEPLAY
1 INTRODUCTION
3 Disruption to movement in individuals with autism was first identified by Kanner (Kanner, 1943)
4 but has received far less attention than social or behavioral aspects. Recent studies demonstrate
5 motor kinematics of purposeful movement are disrupted in autism in tasks as varied as simple
6 horizontal arm movements (Cook et al., 2013), reaching (Sacrey et al., 2014), reach-and-grasp
7 (Stoit et al., 2013), reach-to-touch (Torres et al., 2013), and handwriting (Kushki et al., 2011). In
8 each task a subtle, but significantly different action organization is employed by individuals with
9 autism to complete it, in comparison to typical individuals. Gait (Biffi et al., 2018; Dufek et al.,
10 2017; Lim et al., 2016; Manicolo et al., 2019), postural adjustments during gait (Rinehart et al.,
11 2006), and postural adjustments during load-shift tasks (Schmitz et al., 2003) are also affected,
12 and the efficient prospective organization of movements in a series, or action chain, is thwarted
13 (Fabbri-Destro et al., 2009). A landmark statistical meta-analysis across all available evidence
14 concluded disruption to movement a pervasive feature across the autism spectrum and can be
15 considered a core component of the syndrome (Fournier et al., 2010). The disruption to intentional
16 movement and affective engagement is a likely primary contributor to autism pathogenesis
17 (Trevarthen & Delafield-Butt, 2013).
19 Yet, motor disruption is not included in the formal diagnostic criteria. Repetitive movements are
20 included in the diagnostic criteria in the United States (American Psychiatric Association, 2013)
21 and worldwide (World Health Organization, 1992), but the more subtle motor disturbance to
22 purposeful behavior is not. Only ‘clumsy and awkward’ gait has so far been included in DSM-5
23 as an associated symptom within the syndrome. This lack of diagnostic inclusion is likely due to
SWIPE KINEMATICS DURING SMART TABLET GAMEPLAY
1 two outstanding questions. On the one hand, there is considerable debate whether or not disruption
2 to the motor system extends across the spectrum, or is relevant only to a subset within it. And on
3 the other, the precise nature of the motor disruption is still not well characterized, and so
4 insufficiently defined for operational diagnostic criteria. In this paper, we address the character of
5 the motor kinematics in young children with autism to add resolution to the latter.
7 New technologies in the domain of consumer smart devices and wearable sensors now offer
8 improved, high-precision access to motor signature information, and coupled together with
9 artificial intelligence data analytics of movement patterns may serve as possible early biomarker
10 of the condition in young children (Anzulewicz et al., 2016; Crippa et al., 2015; Hocking &
11 Caeyenberghs, 2017), but the artificial intelligence methods usually deployed for diagnosis in
12 these systems classify the movements in terms of complex ‘black box’ algorithms, rather than with
13 conventional action kinematic variables which can be understood in the context of human
14 movement.
16 Of special interest has been upper limb action kinematics that carry out everyday tasks to
17 manipulate objects and communicate in expressive gesture. Motor disturbance to a child’s agency
18 can alter the expression of everyday purposive behavior and thwart the capacity to efficiently enact
19 an intention (Delafield-Butt & Gangopadhyay 2013). It can create difficulty in adaptive function
20 and social engagement and consequent autistic social and emotional compensations (Cook, 2016;
21 Trevarthen & Delafield-Butt, 2013). It is therefore important to characterize this motor disturbance
22 in terms of its action kinematics. Despite its critical role in manual object manipulation and gestural
23 communication with others, the kinematic atypicalities of upper limb motor control in individuals
SWIPE KINEMATICS DURING SMART TABLET GAMEPLAY
1 with autism remain unclear, often with conflicting results between studies in relation to particular
2 kinematic parameters, e.g., movement speed.
4 Greater time-to-peak velocities during goal-directed arm movements were reported in individuals
5 with autism compared to controls (Campione et al., 2016; Glazebrook et al., 2009, 2006). Longer
6 deceleration times were also found (Mari et al., 2003), although the total percentage of time spent
7 in deceleration was not significantly different. Peak velocity during goal-directed movements
8 appears lower in young adults with autism (Glazebrook et al., 2006) and in low-functioning
9 children with autism (Mari et al., 2003) than in controls, but this kinematic difference is
10 inconsistent. It is absent in some reports (Campione et al., 2016; Dowd et al., 2012; Forti et al.,
11 2011; Yang et al., 2014) and reversed in others (Mari et al., 2003). IQ and autism severity may
12 play a role, for example Mari et al. (2003) reported high functioning children with autism move
13 with greater peak velocity when reaching to grasp an object, and Forti et al. (2011) found a peak
14 velocity positively correlated with IQ in their sample. Moreover, in adults with autism peak
15 velocity was significantly higher than controls in a simple arm swing task (Cook et al., 2013). In
16 all of these studies, motor kinematic differences are consistently reported, but their direction of
17 difference differs between studies and group characteristics. There appears to be no simple,
18 straight-forward kinematic characteristic difference in autism, yet upper limb kinematics by-and-
19 large remain atypical.
21 A relatively consistent finding is that individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) exhibit
22 longer duration movements across a range of distances and target sizes (Campione et al., 2016;
23 Forti et al., 2011; Glazebrook et al., 2006; Nazarali et al., 2009; Schmitz et al., 2003; Stoit et al.,
SWIPE KINEMATICS DURING SMART TABLET GAMEPLAY
1 2013; Yang et al., 2014), with the exception that Mari et al. (2003) found this feature only in low
2 ability ASD children; high ability ASD children exhibiting shorter movement durations. Similarly,
3 Forti et al. (2011) reported an inverse relationship between IQ and movement duration, whereas
4 movement duration was not found to be different between the typically developing (TD) and ASD
5 groups in other studies (Dowd et al., 2012; Fabbri-Destro et al., 2009). Cook et al. (2013) found a
6 shorter movement duration in ASD, however this was for a different task involving sinusoidal arm
7 movements, rather than a task involving a specific spatial goal at its endpoint.
9 A major bottleneck in kinematic studies of individuals with autism, and especially children with
10 autism, is the laboratory conditions under which they are normally conducted. Optical motion
11 tracking technologies employed in the kinematic studies above require dedicated laboratories set
12 within universities or clinical centers that require the child to come to these unfamiliar settings to
13 take part. Further the tasks require didactic verbal instruction and cooperation on the part of the
14 child. This can be difficult or impossible for some individuals with autism, especially young
15 children with limited linguistic comprehension or motivation for sharing the intentions of the
16 experimenter. However, most of young children with or without autism are attracted to tablet
17 computers and can easily engage in tablet games without complicated instructions. Thus, we
18 employed two smart tablet games to attract the interests of the children without verbal instruction.
19 We reasoned this method would collect movement information from the children with greater
20 ecological validity than our laboratory-based optical motion tracking paradigmatic counterparts.
22 Further, as we show above, the field of motor control in autism requires clarification, because
23 although the general finding of atypical movement kinematics is consistently reported across the
SWIPE KINEMATICS DURING SMART TABLET GAMEPLAY
1 literature, the precise nature of this atypicality is inconsistent across the literature. Thus, it is
2 imperative more studies are carried out with greater numbers of subjects to improve statistical
3 power and allow exploration of variance across the wide breadth of the autism spectrum, and
4 especially over developmental time. Such large-scale data collection is feasible with attractive, fun
5 serious games paradigms on mobile platforms that can be brought to the children in situ in their
6 normal routine in their nursery, classroom, or clinic. Group sizes can be significant enlarged from
7 standard laboratory data collection points that put the onus of responsibility on the parents of the
8 child with autism, and the burden to accommodate the testing on the child. Fun, attractive tablet
9 games reverse this imbalance. When placed in the classroom or clinic, the smart tablet game can
10 become a positive highlight of the day and attract enthusiastic attention. The children engage of
11 their own volition.
13 Previous kinematic studies of children focused on children aged 6-12 years. No study has yet
14 focused on motor kinematics of preschool children aged 2-6 years. Importantly, visual-motor
15 integration (VMI) skills change dynamically in early childhood, improving remarkably at 4-5 years
16 old (Fang et al., 2017; von Hofsten & Rösblad, 1988). Also, the brainstem sensorimotor regions
17 responsible for subsecond timing of adaptive movement develop differently from at least the
18 preschool age onward in autism (Bosco et al., 2019; Delafield-Butt & Trevarthen, 2017; Jou et al.,
19 2013, 2009). Thus, this study set out to determine the kinematic differences in young preschool
20 children taking into account age and task requirement.
22 In this paper, we employed smart tablet games (1) to compute how preschool children’s movement
23 kinematics differ between ASD and TD conditions, and by doing so (2) to test the feasibility of
SWIPE KINEMATICS DURING SMART TABLET GAMEPLAY
1 utilizing the smart tablet touch trajectory data for testing kinematic differences. Further, we sought
2 to (3) determine age effects and (4) context dependent effects on any kinematic differences
3 between groups to advance a more precisely defined developmental characterization of kinematic
4 differences in young children with autism.
7 METHODOLOGY
9 Data and participants
11 The data used for analysis were from a previous project (Anzulewicz et al., 2016) carried in out in
12 accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the University of Strathclyde Ethics
13 Committee. 82 children were recruited in the study, including 37 children with ASD and 45 TD
14 children. The age of the participants ranged from 25 to 79 months (54.95 ± 11.65 months of the
15 ASD group; 55.49 ± 11.24 months of the TD group).
17 Two smart tablet games
19 Two smart tablet games, “Sharing” and “Creativity”, were introduced to the participants on an
20 iPad mini (Apple Inc.). A 2-min demonstration was provided before a 5-min play of each game.
21 The Sharing game was presented before the Drawing game.
SWIPE KINEMATICS DURING SMART TABLET GAMEPLAY
2 started. The food item would split into four pieces after the participant tapped on it, and then the
3 participant could move the food pieces to the four characters who were attractively animated, but
4 stayed in their position. Movements across the screen were recorded by the system and used to
5 give the swipe kinematics. After each character had a piece of food, an animation of the characters
6 eating the food would be presented and then the next food item would pop up. Participants played
7 the game till the 5-min session ended.
9 There were three main phases of the Creativity game, including choosing an object, tracing the
10 contours of the object, and coloring the object. The touches and/or swipes on the screen were again
11 recorded to give the Creativity data. Participants were not required to trace the contours perfectly.
12 Once they touched on the dash lines, the contours of the object would be completed automatically
13 and then a color plate would pop up. Participants could choose from varied colors for coloring,
14 and they could select other objects at any time during the 5-min session.
16 Identify the swipe movements
18 The timestamp, x- and y-coordinates, and the phase of participants’ touch on the screen were
19 recorded during gameplay. The data were collected at approximately 60Hz, but this varied slightly
20 depending on the workload of the smart tablet. The touch phase was noted in the data with integers
21 from 0 to 4, describing the interaction between the participant and the smart tablet (0: touch began;
22 1: touch moved; 2: stationary touch; 3: touch ended; 4: touch cancelled). Data were stored as
23 individual time point records in a database structure by the system which we not necessarily in
SWIPE KINEMATICS DURING SMART TABLET GAMEPLAY
1 chronological order and could include multiple records with the same timestamp therefore post
2 processing of the data was required.
4 Customized MATLAB scripts were written for the data analysis. To identify the swipe movements
5 during smart tablet gameplay, the raw data were first sorted by time. Then, the touch phase
6 information was used to find the start of each of the series of movements in the data (number ‘0’
7 in the touch phase column). After the start points had been identified, the end of each movement
8 was found in the movement data (touch phase number ‘3’) by searching between adjacent start
9 points. Sections of movement data with both start and end points were identified as ‘complete
10 movements’ and kept for the next phase of screening. Incomplete movements or sections with a
11 length of two frames (a tap on the screen) were discarded. Also, sections of movements with
12 multiple touches were removed from analysis. Finally, for the Sharing game, purposeful food
13 sharing swipes were distinguished from other interactions with the screen by defining a ‘food’ area
14 around the location where the food was presented on the screen and a ‘target’ area running across
16 were used to identify the food-to-target swipes for subsequent analysis.
18 Swipe kinematics
21 consecutive touch points was defined as the travelled distance, and the direct distance between the
22 start and end points was defined as the minimal distance. The difference between the cumulative
23 travelled distance and the minimal difference was also calculated and presented as the difference
SWIPE KINEMATICS DURING SMART TABLET GAMEPLAY
1 in distance. The time duration of each swipe was also calculated and the average swipe speed was
2 computed as the cumulative distance divided by the time duration.
4 For the Creativity game, each swipe was identified. Then, similar to the food-to-target swipes, the
5 cumulative distance between the consecutive touch points was defined as the travelled distance.
6 Also, the time duration and average speed of each swipe were calculated.
8 Mann-Whitney U tests were used to test for any kinematic differences between the ASD and TD
9 swipes. The comparison between the ASD and TD groups was first performed irrespective of age.
10 However, visuomotor integration changes remarkably at 4-5 years old (Fang et al., 2017; von
11 Hofsten & Rösblad, 1988). Therefore, we also performed comparisons at younger (< 60 months)
12 and older (≥ 60 months) age levels.
14 RESULTS
16 Sharing game
18 When analyzing each group as a whole irrespective of age levels, a total of 1585 food-to-target
19 swipes were identified from the ASD group and a total of 3201 food-to-target swipes were
20 identified from the TD group. Significant differences (p < 0.05) between the ASD and TD swipes
22 ASD children spent more time moving to a further away point than TD children, which led to a
23 slower speed. In addition, the difference between the cumulative travelled distance and the
SWIPE KINEMATICS DURING SMART TABLET GAMEPLAY
1 minimal distance was higher in ASD children, implying that they performed less efficient food-
2 to-target swipes.
4 Looking at the younger sub-group (< 60 months), significant differences (p < 0.05) between the
5 ASD and TD swipes were observed in the travelled distance, average speed, minimal distance, and
7 a food-to-target swipe. However, ASD travelled for a longer distance and to a further away
8 destination than TD, leading to a faster average speed. Also, the ASD group deviated from the
9 minimal distance more than the TD group.
11 In the older sub-group (≥ 60 months), significant differences between the ASD and TD swipes
14 However, ASD spent more time than TD. In addition, the minimal distance in ASD was shorter
15 than TD. As a result, ASD moved slower than TD but again they deviated more from the minimal
16 distance than the TD group.
18 Within the TD group, significant differences were observed between the two age levels in the
20 TD moved faster to complete food-to-target swipes, and they tended to move to farer destinations.
21 Also, the distance difference decreased, suggesting more efficient food-to-target swipes in TD at
22 the older age level. As for the ASD group, significant differences were observed between the two
SWIPE KINEMATICS DURING SMART TABLET GAMEPLAY
1 children, ASD children moved significantly slower to complete the food-to-target swipes at the
2 older age level than at the younger age level. No difference was found between the two age levels
3 in the minimal distance nor the distance difference, implying the food-to-target swipe efficiency
4 did not change in ASD as age increased.
6 In summary, in the Sharing game, children with ASD moved faster than TD children to complete
7 food-to-target swipes at the younger age level while they moved slower than TD children at the
8 older age level. In terms of the minimal distance, children with ASD tended to travel to further
9 destinations than TD children at the younger age level while they travelled to nearer destinations
10 than TD children at the older age level. At both age levels, children with ASD deviated more from
11 the minimal distance than TD children in the food-to-target swipes. As age increased, TD children
12 performed faster and more efficient foot-to-target swipes (i.e., less distance difference). Children
13 with ASD moved slower to complete food-to-target swipes at the older age level, but the swipe
14 efficiency did not improve.
16 Creativity game
18 In the data of each group as a whole despite of age, a total of 3063 Creativity swipes were identified
19 from the ASD group and a total of 3551 Creativity swipes were identified from the TD group.
20 Children with ASD spent significantly less time while no significance was observed in the
21 cumulative travelled distance, hence performed significantly faster swipes than TD children in the
SWIPE KINEMATICS DURING SMART TABLET GAMEPLAY
1 In the younger sub-group (< 60 months), significant differences between ASD and TD swipes were
3 4). With similar travelled distance, children with ASD spent less time completing a swipe, leading
4 to a faster speed.
6 In the older sub-group (≥ 60 months), similar to what was observed in the younger age level, no
7 significant difference was found in the travelled distance but in the duration and average speed
11 2) and they moved faster to complete each swipe. Children with ASD also travelled for a longer
12 distance during Creativity gameplay at the older age level, however, the average speed did not
13 statistically change.
15 In summary, children with ASD moved faster than TD children at both age levels in the Creativity
16 game while no difference was observed in the cumulative travelled distance. In comparison to
17 those aged < 60 months, both ASD and TD children aged ≥ 60 months made longer swipes in the
18 Creativity game. It was also observed that TD children at the older age level swiped faster during
19 the Creativity game, but children with ASD demonstrated no significant speed change regarding
20 to the age levels.
22 Speed difference between Sharing and Creativity games
SWIPE KINEMATICS DURING SMART TABLET GAMEPLAY
2 age level, TD children moved faster to complete the Creativity swipes than how they completed
3 the food-to-target swipes in the Sharing game. At the older age level, TD children moved slower
4 to complete the Creativity swipes than completing a food-to-target swipe in the Sharing game.
5 However, at both age levels, children with ASD moved faster in the Creativity game than
6 performing the food-to-target swipes in the Sharing game.
9 DISCUSSION
11 This study examined the kinematic differences between children with ASD and TD at two age
12 levels with a cut-off at 5 years old as the ability to integrate visual information with proprioceptive
13 information appears to develop between age 4-5 years old (von Hofsten & Rösblad, 1988), and
14 VMI skills were reported to increase quickly at 4 and peaked at 5 years old (Fang et al., 2017).
15 Two sets of smart tablet gameplay were used in this study, one involved goal-directed swipes
16 (Sharing) while the other involved free-form swipes (Creativity). The different game contexts
17 produced different kinematics. Children with ASD < 5 years old performed faster goal-directed
18 swipes than controls during the Sharing game, whereas ASD children ≥ 5 years old performed
19 slower goal-directed swipes than controls. In addition to the differences in movement speed,
20 children with ASD deviated more from the minimal food-to-target distance than controls
21 irrespective of age. In the Creativity game, ASD children moved faster than controls at both age
22 levels when performing relatively unconstrained swipes.
SWIPE KINEMATICS DURING SMART TABLET GAMEPLAY
1 The slower goal-directed swipes in children with ASD ≥ 5 years old observed in our study were
2 consistent with reports that studied the reach-to-grasp movement (Campione et al., 2016; Stoit et
3 al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014). Participants performed goal-directed movements from point to point
4 in the reach-to-grasp experiments, with longer movement duration observed in individuals with
5 ASD in comparison to controls (Campione et al., 2016; Stoit et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014), except
6 for those with IQ score ≥ 80 in the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children (Mari et al., 2003).
7 The age of the participants in these grasp-to-reach studies were mostly > 5 years old, with only a
8 few of the participants aged < 5 years old. In the grasp-to-reach experiments by Campione et al.
9 (2016), they reported the kinematics of participants aged from 4.3 to 5.9 years without detail
10 investigation of the age effect. These grasp-to-reach studies used a fixed distance for the point-to-
11 point activities whereas in our study the start and end points of the food-to-plate swipes could vary
12 within a small area. Despite this difference in design, our results agree with these point-to-point
13 studies in that food-to-target swipes in children with ASD ≥ 5 years old were slower than TD
14 children. Also, with our food-to-target swipe data, we calculated the difference between the
15 minimal distance and cumulative travelled distance, which may imply the efficiency of the swipe.
16 Children with ASD demonstrated greater distance differences than TD children at both age levels,
17 which suggests less efficient swipes in children with ASD to complete the food-to-target task.
18 Within the TD group, the deviation from the food-to-target straight line decreased significantly
19 (swipe efficiency increased) as age increased, showing them gaining motor competency as they
20 age. However, the improvement was not observed in the children with ASD, which could suggest
21 this movement strategy did not change at least until 6 years old and may reflect an unchanging
22 deficit in the autism group.
SWIPE KINEMATICS DURING SMART TABLET GAMEPLAY
1 In addition to reach-to-grasp, our findings are in line with some of other point-to-point studies such
2 as transporting objects (Fabbri-Destro et al., 2009; Forti et al., 2011), digitizing targets (Dowd et
3 al., 2012; Rinehart et al., 2006), and manual aiming (Glazebrook et al., 2009, 2006). As what we
4 found in our food-to-target swipes at age > 5 years, longer movement durations in participants
5 with ASD were observed in comparison to the controls (Fabbri-Destro et al. 2009; Glazebrook et
6 al. 2009, 2006) except for those with IQ scores higher than 70 (Rinehart et al., 2006). Forti et al.
7 (2011) observed longer movement durations in young children with ASD aged around 3.5 years,
8 which is opposite to what we found in our study. However, the task Forti et al. used in their study
9 is considered more complex than ours, in which their young participants were instructed to
10 transport a ball and drop it into a hole.
12 Different from the point-to-point tasks, less visual cue of where to stop or change the movement
13 was provided in our Creativity game. In this relatively unconstrained Creativity game, we observed
14 faster swipes in children with ASD irrespective of age levels. Faster and jerkier movements in
15 adults with ASD in comparison to controls were reported in an arm swing study (Cook et al., 2013),
16 and it suggested that individuals with ASD have difficulties in predicting the point in space for
17 kinematic modulation. The absence of clear start and end points in our Creativity game could make
18 these difficulties more noticeable. However, it should be noted that our Creativity game and the
19 arm swing activity are very different tasks.
21 There are some limitations of this study and some future considerations to be noted. Intelligence
22 level was reported to affect the movement kinematics (Mari et al., 2003; Rinehart et al., 2006).
23 Our study did not include IQ measures, which prevented us from investigating the effect of this
SWIPE KINEMATICS DURING SMART TABLET GAMEPLAY
1 factor on the swipe kinematics during smart tablet gameplay. The inclusion of IQ scores in the
2 future studies will be beneficial for a comprehensive understanding of the motor signatures in ASD.
3 In comparison to the point-to-point tasks in previous studies, there were no precise start and end
4 points in our Sharing game however our conclusions were the same. Our smart tablet gameplay
5 method also provided the opportunity to explore other interesting motor control patterns such as
6 the minimal food-to-target distance modulation and therefore we favored it. However, a
7 complementary set of precise point-to-point task conducted on the smart tablet could be included
8 in future studies to provide an in-depth comparison of the motor control patterns between these
9 paradigms.
11 Future studies of motor kinematics require further development. Action kinematics are
12 psychomotor expressions of underlying neuromotor physiology. The primary disruption is likely
13 to be in these systems themselves, and the measured action kinematics a manifestation of those
14 neural disruptions. Therefore, kinematic studies that address fundamental motor control theory,
15 such as feed-forward and feed-back systems in motor control (Nazarali et al., 2009), prospective
16 motor control such as shown for infant movement (Delafield‐Butt et al., 2018; Gottwald et al.,
17 2016; Lee, 2009), predictive coding in motor systems (Gonzalez-Gadea et al., 2015; Van de Cruys
18 et al., 2014) or entropy analyses (Liu et al., 2017) will begin to afford insight into disruptions of
19 those neural systems in autism. The advantage of the methodology we employ here is rapid, non-
20 intrusive collection of precise laboratory-grade kinematic data within an ecologically valid, fun,
21 and attractive serious game format.
23 One possible underlying disruption of interest to our work is in brainstem growth errors that affect
SWIPE KINEMATICS DURING SMART TABLET GAMEPLAY
1 integration of sensory and motor information at the level of the brainstem, especially the inferior
2 olivary nucleus (Delafield-Butt & Trevarthen, 2017). This is supported by basic upper limb motor
3 kinematics that show increased jerk amplitude at around 13 Hz (Cook et al., 2013) that is a
4 predicted neurophysiological effect of disruption to the inferior olive (Fatemi et al., 2012; Welsh
5 et al., 2005, 1995) and evidence of volumetric and morphometric differences in growth of
6 brainstem sensorimotor regions (Bosco et al., 2019). We have shown that movement kinematics
7 maybe a valuable marker for autism indicative of underlying disruption to brainstem-cerebellar
8 sensorimotor integration.
10 This study supports the utilization of smart tablet gameplay to investigate the kinematic differences
11 between young children with ASD and their age matched controls. Other tablet games have been
12 developed for recording human kinematics (Culmer et al., 2009; Matic & Gomez-Marin, 2019),
13 but these are not gamified, require complicated verbal instruction and so are less suitable for young
14 children with ASD averse to instruction. Other tablet assessments do follow serious game
15 methodologies, but are not yet attending to motor kinematic information. We show here, for the
16 first time, laboratory-grade kinematic analyses of children's swipe movement that are ecologically
17 valid and that have been generated without notable experimenter instruction. In addition to the
18 kinematic differences between ASD and TD groups, the kinematic differences were examined at
19 two age levels and in two different gameplay contexts. To our knowledge, this study is the first
20 one to identify the age- and task-related effects in swipe kinematics in preschool children with
21 ASD and TD.

1 In addition, in our data it is clear that TD children learn over the years between 2 and 6 to swipe
2 efficiently and effectively and hence their speed of action increases. In contrast, children with ASD
3 at a younger age swipe faster but less accurately and then appear to slow down with age,
4 presumably to improve accuracy and gain better control. As a result, the swipe speed of children
5 with ASD may start higher than TD children at 2-3 years old, decrease to parity around 4-5 years
6 old and then decrease to below the controls at 6 years old and above. This finding has two
7 important implications. First, when analyzing movement kinematics and testing for differences,
8 we must consider this effect as the opposite trends have the ability to cancel each other out leading
9 us to falsely conclude there are no differences between children with ASD and TD when in fact
10 there are, they just differ across the age levels. This may account for the apparent confusion in the
11 literature where many studies recruit samples from participants above and below 4-5 years but
12 analyze them all together (e.g., Dowd et al., 2012). We would recommend that researchers pay
13 attention to the age-related differences in their analyses of autistic motor signatures. Second, when
14 considering a diagnostic test for ASD based on the swipe kinematics, the age of the participant is
15 a consideration. Kinematic differences are likely to be bigger between children with ASD and TD
16 between 2-3 years old and above 6 years old and may not be as apparent between 4-5 years old. In
17 our opinion an early diagnosis is preferable as it allows parents, family, key health and social care
18 workers and teachers to undertake early interventions to mitigate the detrimental aspects of ASD
19 for the child, family and school. Traditionally in the UK, children enter school between 4-5 years
20 old and this can be when many children are assessed for ASD. Our data indicate that the smart
21 tablet gameplay methodology could identify possible individuals with ASD as early as 2 years old
22 if a suitable structure could be put in place for undertaking the tests in their preschool lives.
