Abstract
The freedom to choose between options is strongly linked to notions of free will. Accordingly,
several studies have shown that individuals demonstrate a preference for choice, or the availability
of multiple options, over and above utilitarian value. Yet we lack a decision-making framework that
integrates preference for choice with traditional utility maximisation in free choice behaviour. Here
we test the predictions of an inference-based model of decision-making in which an agent actively
seeks states yielding entropy (availability of options) in addition to utility (economic reward). We
designed a study in which participants freely navigated a virtual environment consisting of two
consecutive choices leading to reward locations in separate rooms. Critically, the choice of one
room always led to two final doors while, in the second room, only one door was permissible to
choose. This design allowed us to separately determine the influence of utility and entropy on
participants’ choice behaviour and their self-evaluation of free will. We found that choice behaviour
was better predicted by an inference-based model than by expected utility alone, and that both the
availability of options and the value of the context positively influenced participants’ perceived
freedom of choice. Moreover, this consideration of options was apparent in the ongoing motion
dynamics as individuals navigated the environment. In a second study, in which participants
selected between rooms that gave access to three or four doors, we observed a similar pattern of
results, with participants preferring the room that gave access to more options and feeling freer in
it. These results suggest that free choice behaviour is well explained by an inference-based
framework in which both utility and entropy are optimised and supports the idea that the feeling of
having free will is tightly related to options availability.

Introduction
The ability to choose is considered central to libertarian theories of free will, which propose that
decisions are experienced as free only when an individual has the ‘ability to do otherwise’ (Banja,
2015; Roskies, 2010; Stillman et al., 2011). This preference for choice, in which individuals
preferentially select options that provide further choices, has also been observed in numerous
behavioural studies (Bown et al., 2003; Cockburn et al., 2014; Fujiwara et al., 2013; Leotti and
Delgado, 2011; Ono, 2000). When faced with choosing between an option that leads to a set
action or a an option that leads to a subsequent choice, humans, and other species, show a
preference for the option providing further choice (Bown et al., 2003; Catania, 1975; Fujiwara et al.,
2013; Leotti and Delgado, 2011; Ono, 2000; Ryan and Deci, 2000; Suzuki, 1999, 1997).
Individuals are also more likely to choose an item when offered with an alternative than when the
same item is offered alone (Bown et al., 2003). This behaviour is evident despite the additional
choice providing no gain in reward, or in some cases, even a sacrifice of reward (Bennett et al.,
2016). This “over-valuation” of choice seems paradoxical when considered according to utilitarian
value alone, and has led to the suggestion that the ability to choose may be rewarding in itself,
serving to encourage an individual to exercise control over the environment (Fujiwara et al., 2013;
Inesi et al., 2011; Leotti et al., 2010; Leotti and Delgado, 2011).
As choice availability provides no utility of its own, choice preference has been difficult to
account for with classical economic decision models that consider decisions on the basis of
expected utility alone (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Nash, 1950). The value of choice is only
considered when it increases the likelihood of attaining a preferred item, such as when the
likelihood of a preferred item being available is increased by having a larger option set (Pattanaik
and Xu, 1998). However, it does not account for an inherent preference for choice when it does not
affect the value of the outcome attained. Recently, inferential accounts of decision-making have
considered the value of occupying states with more options available as a means of entropy
maximisation, in addition to utility maximisation, and may, therefore, better account for the
preference for choice.
Inferential accounts of decision-making are based on the idea that decision and planning
problems are accomplished using probabilistic inference, with an internal model that represents the
contingencies between actions and outcomes. These include active inference (Friston et al., 2017,
2015; Pezzulo et al., 2016; Schwartenbeck et al., 2018, 2015), probabilistic planning-as-inference
(Botvinick and Toussaint, 2012; Pezzulo and Rigoli, 2011; Solway and Botvinick, 2012; Stoianov et
al., 2018) and KL control (Kappen et al., 2012). As a predominant example in human cognition,
active inference posits that the brain uses approximate Bayesian inference to steer both perception
and action planning (Friston, 2010; Parr et al., 2022; Pezzulo et al., 2015). Action selection is
described as a process of minimization of a measure of discrepancy between an agent's
expectations and its observations. Under some assumptions, this measure of discrepancy can be
assimilated to "surprise" or "prediction error", but more formally it is defined as a "free energy" -
and hence active inference agents select actions that (are expected to) minimize free energy.
Crucially, the process of free energy minimization is different from utility maximization, since it
considers utility and entropy contributions to choice; see the Methods and (Parr et al., 2022) for
more details.
The entropy component suggests that, in the absence of precise prior beliefs, maximally
uncertain beliefs about the hidden states of the world should be adopted. This corresponds to
Jaynes’ maximum entropy principle, which states that the probability distribution which best
represents the current state of knowledge about a system is the one with largest entropy (Jaynes,
1957). In the context of decision-making, this implies that an agent should actively seek higher
entropy states that offer more future choices, or “keep its options open” (Klyubin et al., 2008). This
is because maintaining highly precise prior beliefs in uncertain settings can likely produce large
prediction errors; conversely, by maximising the number of expected possibilities and the entropy
of its prior beliefs, the agent can minimise its future surprise (or more formally, free energy) (Parr et
al., 2022; Pezzulo and Ognibene, 2011; Schwartenbeck et al., 2015). In sum, in comparison to
utility maximisation, inference-based models cast both utilitarian preferences and the maximisation
of options within one and the same adaptive mechanisms for decision-making (Friston, 2010;
Friston et al., 2017; Pezzulo et al., 2018; Pezzulo et al., 2015), and could offer a framework to
explain free choice behaviour. Importantly, models based on expected utility alone versus
inference-based models that additionally account for entropy can lead to divergent predictions
about choice behaviour, hence these alternative predictions remain to be tested empirically.
Furthermore, given the conceptual link between the 'ability to do otherwise' in free will and
preference for choice, a novel consideration is that states of higher entropy could correspond to
greater perceived freedom of choice.
The objectives of this work were twofold. The first was to investigate whether entropy
maximization is a significant consideration in guiding sequential choice behavior, as predicted by
inference-based schemes. The second objective was to test the hypothesis that states with greater
utility and entropy would be subjectively experienced with higher perceived freedom of choice, as
reported by participants. For this, we designed two two-step decision studies in a virtual
environment, where participants freely navigated through two consecutive rooms to find rewards.
In the first study (Experimental task 1), participants learned that choosing one room led to two
doors that were always open while, in the second room, one of the doors was always locked. The
location of the locked door in the second room changed trial to trial. This was essential to ensure
that participants could choose, or sample, between four outcomes overall but that one room was
always associated with more options (higher entropy) than the other. By manipulating the relative
values of reward outcomes between the two rooms, we were able to determine the relative
influence of value and entropy on participants’ choice behaviour. We hypothesised that choice
behaviour would be better explained by a model predicting a bias towards the room providing both
more choice and higher reward, than a pure expected utility model, predicting a bias towards the
room with higher reward alone. We further predicted that both these factors of utility and entropy
would influence participants’ perceived sense of freedom. We also analysed the participants’
motion dynamics as they navigated the virtual environment for evidence of ongoing choice
deliberation. We hypothesised that motion trajectory variability and changes of mind would be
greater in the context of greater choice availability, reflecting the consideration of alternative choice
options throughout the decision-making period. Finally, we designed a second study (Experimental
task 2) with the same structure as the first study, but in which participants selected between a
room with four doors always open versus a room with one door closed. This second study permits
assessing the generality of a putative 'preference for choice', beyond the case of one versus two
rooms.
Materials and Methods
Experimental task 1: decision between 2-Choice vs. 1-Choice rooms
Participants
Twenty-eight participants were recruited from the University of Queensland after providing
written informed consent. All participants were right-handed, had normal or corrected to normal
vision, and no history of psychiatric disease, neurological trauma or disorder. The only exclusion
criteria were that participants be of at least 18 years of age. One participant was excluded for
failing to properly follow task instructions, and data from the remaining 27 participants were used
for the behavioural analyses (23 female, mean age 21 years, range 18-24 years). Participants
were monetarily compensated for their time. The University of Queensland Medical Research
Ethics Committee approved the experiment.
Task design
The task was based in a virtual environment, presented using Psychtoolbox on MATLAB
(MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Participants viewed a first-person perspective from their
current position in a three-dimensional environment, which updated continuously as they moved.
and underwent a training period to practise navigating in the task environment prior to commencing
the experimental task. Participants were asked to make two consecutive decisions between two
sets of doors (one set of doors for each decision) in order to reach the location of gems they would
like to collect. To navigate the environment, participants held down the up-arrow key to move
forward and the left and right arrow keys to turn in each direction. When a door was reached, it
could be opened by pressing the space bar. Choosing the left or right door in the first room would
determine the subsequent room, and choosing left or right in the second room would open the door
to receive the gem at that location.
Critically, participants were informed that a final door could be “barricaded" (locked), in which
case it was unavailable to choose on that trial and the other available door should be selected. To
aid in the training, selecting the locked door resulted in a skull cue with no points gained.
Participants rapidly learned not to select this door during the training period, which was confirmed
by no participant choosing this door during the experimental task. In each block, one of the final
rooms always had one locked door. The location of this room remained constant throughout each
block, enabling participants to quickly differentiate the two rooms, but the specific locked door (left
or right) changed pseudo-randomly on each trial. Hence, in the first room, one door always led to a
room that had both doors available (2-Choice), whereas the other door always led to a room that
had only one door available (1-Choice). Importantly, this design ensured that four final locations
were available throughout the block, such that if participants attempted to equally sample each
A gem, of varying value, was gained after selection of any available door and presented for 1s.
Within each room, the mean value of the gems behind both doors was equivalent, but the actual
number of points received each trial varied according to a set variance of 2 points. The participants
were informed that “Each pile of gems is worth a certain number of points”, and that their locations
would remain consistent throughout each block. Participants were not informed of the precise
values but were told that the points gained from a pile could vary between trials. Critically, the
relative values of the gems between the two rooms varied between blocks according to five
conditions. In the first condition, the mean values of gems in each room were equal (M=6 points).
This condition permitted us to test if there was any choice bias present for each participant
when values of rewards were equal across all doors. If the availability of choice was a factor in
participants’ choices, we would expect the choice proportion for the 2-Choice room to be greater
than 0.5, whereas equal probability would indicate choices were not influenced by the number of
options. In two conditions, the value of gems in the 2-Choice room was either greater (M=8 points)
or much greater (M=10 points) than the value of the gems in the 1-Choice room (M=6 points). In
the remaining two conditions, the reverse was true. This factorial design enabled us to investigate
the combined effects of option availability and value on choice behaviour. Before the experiment,
the participants made 10 practice trials. During the experiment, two blocks of each of the five
conditions were presented, counter-balanced for door position, and each block consisted of 40
trials, giving 80 trials in total for each condition.
Following each block, participants provided a rating of their perceived level of freedom for the
left and right rooms on a free-sliding visual analogue scale with ‘Not free’ (0) at one end and ‘Very
free’ at the other (10) (Filevich et al., 2013). The slider was centred (5), requiring participants to
use the left arrow to indicate less free and the right arrow to indicate more free. Participants were
instructed to give this rating according to their own interpretation of “how free” they felt their
decision for each room was. The room positions were counterbalanced in order to circumvent
stereotypical and automated responding, but allowed us to determine the perceived freedom for
each room.
environment in order to reach the gem that they wished to choose. Left panel shows the decision tree for a
single trial. Participants first chose between two doors leading to two separate rooms. In one room, both
doors were always available (2-Choice), whereas in the second room one of the doors (randomly left or right)
was always locked (1-Choice). The value of the gems was manipulated so that the two rooms were either
equivalent in value or one was comparatively more valuable than the other. Right panel shows the
participant perspective for the doors in each of the rooms, noting that the only difference is the presence of a
barricade across the left door in the 1-Choice room on the right-hand side.
Behavioural analysis
We calculated choice bias by the proportion of trials the 2-Choice room was selected over the
1-Choice room. We performed a one-sample t-test to determine if the bias was significantly
different from 0.5 for the baseline condition (2C=1C) and also overall. We also quantified the
choice bias of each participant, by considering whether the proportion of times they selected the 2-
Choice room was greater than 0.5. Furthermore, we carried out a linear regression analysis to
ascertain to what extent individual participant choices were predicted by expected utility. For each
trial, utility was calculated as the relative reward value of the gems in the 2-Choice room compared
to the 1-Choice room, which changed in each condition according to the respective mean gem
value of each room, for example +2 in the 2C>1C condition and -2 in the 1C>2C condition. The
dependent variable was choice response, which we coded as +1 for the 2-Choice room and -1 for
the 1-Choice room on each trial. A positive coefficient would indicate a positive influence of each
factor, whereas a negative coefficient would signify avoidance. We assessed group-level
significance with one-sample t-tests for utility and entropy gain.
Subjective reports of perceived freedom of choice for each room were analysed with a 2x5
repeated measures ANOVA, including factors of Choice Availability (1-Choice or 2-Choice rooms)
and Value, separated by the five conditions from the lowest to highest comparative value for each
room. For Value, Mauchly's Test of Sphericity indicated that the assumption of sphericity had been
violated (p<0.001), so a Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied.
Model specification
We created a computational model of the task environment to compare predictions from a
classical expected utility model (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Nash, 1950) with an active
inference model (Friston et al., 2013; Pezzulo et al., 2015). Expected utility theory is based on the
idea that agents maximise utility, but are otherwise insensitive to other features of the environment.
In comparison, active inference predicts that agents are driven by probabilistic planning to
maximise entropy as well as utility. Note that while we implement an active inference model,
similar predictions can be made with other inference-based models that incorporate entropy. Below
we briefly describe the active inference model (using a Markov Decision Process approach) as well
as its reduced version that implements expected utility alone.
Active inference is built on the premise that an agent builds a generative model of its decision
context, which creates a probabilistic mapping from the underlying hidden states to the outcomes
that are observed. This mapping is updated using variational Bayes, described in detail in Friston
et al. (Friston et al., 2017). The assumption is that, in order to plan upcoming choices, agents
perform inference on three main elements: the current state, policies, and the precision of beliefs.
The current state reflects a probabilistic belief about the state the agent is in. Policies are the
possible action sequences an agent can take to reach (probabilistically) future states. Precision
reflects the agent’s confidence in policy selection, and it controls the stochasticity of action
selection (Friston et al., 2017).
The generative model of an active inference model is specified by A, B, C and d matrices

that we implemented, there are only four directly-observable states and each is uniquely

makes only the first action to choose left or right, leading to the 2-Choice or 1-Choice room,
respectively. The left policy had a 50% likelihood of the agent reaching either one of the two
possible reward locations, whereas the right policy led deterministically to the one available
reward, illustrating the fact that the 2-Choice room is associated with higher entropy over outcomes
than the 1-Choice room. The c and d vectors correspond to an agent’s prior beliefs about
observations and initial states, respectively. We specified a c-vector for every condition, to account
for the changing reward value of the gems (c=2, 3, or 4 equivalent to 6, 8, or 10 points).
We simulated agent behaviour according to either expected utility (equation 1) or an active
inference scheme, which maximises both expected utility and entropy (equation 2).

The expected utility model considers the probability of reaching future states by following a
given policy , and the utility of these states. The inference model incorporates an additional
factor of entropy 𝐻 over those future expected states (right side of equation 2). Predictions from
each of these models were then compared to participant choice behaviour in order to determine
the respective model evidence.
The A matrix provides the mappings from hidden states to observations. In this model, there were only four
states possible and each mapped to a unique outcome. The first state corresponds to the starting point,
states 2 and 3 represent the reward locations possible in the 2-Choice room and state 4 is the single reward
location in the 1-Choice room. The B matrix defines the transition probabilities. The agent could choose left
or right to select the 2-Choice or 1-Choice room, respectively. Choosing left led to a 50% probability of
reaching either one of the two reward locations. Choosing right led deterministically to the single reward
location. The c-vector was specified for each condition to represent a prior on the reward value of the gems
available in each room. The d vector denotes the prior belief of the initial state.
We performed model inversion, based on variational Bayes, using the spm_dcm_mdp.m
function within the DEM toolbox (SPM12, Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK)
(Schwartenbeck and Friston, 2016). Participant choices were coded as a Markov decision process,
in which states corresponded to the left or right doors chosen in the 2-Choice room and the door
chosen (regardless of location) in the 1-Choice room. Actions corresponded to choosing the 2-
Choice (“left”) room or 1-Choice (“right”) room. We obtained separate MAP-estimates for
participants' priors on precision (β, where precision = 1/β), which characterises a participant's
tendency towards goal-directed behaviour, for each of the five conditions with a prior mean of 0
and a prior variance of 1/16. Higher β values indicate less influence of free energy in driving policy
selection and, therefore, more randomness. After model inversion, we compared all free energies,
which provide an approximation to model evidence, for each participant using Bayesian model
comparison to determine whether participant behaviour was better predicted by expected utility or
active inference (Rigoux et al., 2014; Stephan et al., 2009).
Decision trajectory analysis
The Cartesian (x,y) coordinates of the participant’s position in virtual space were measured
with every screen refresh (60 Hz) in order to determine the trajectories of participants’ movements
towards the doors for each decision. Approximately 2s of data were collected for each room,
according to the individual response time and trajectory. Our primary analysis concerned the
trajectories in each of the final rooms (2-Choice and 1-Choice rooms), given our hypothesis that
physical markers of deliberation would be greater when an alternative option remained available
than when faced with only one option. For completion, we also analysed the trajectories in the first
room, splitting trials according to which second room was chosen on that trial.
We first calculated trials that contained one or more reversals in direction that occurred along
the x-axis in the trajectory, termed ‘x-flips’ (Dale et al., 2008). This measure of motion trajectory
complexity is thought to arise due to competing evidence, or uncertainty, in the underlying decision
plan (McKinstry et al., 2008). In contrast to typical mouse-tracking studies, the keyboard navigation
in our computer virtual environment was relatively smooth, and so we used this measure only to
examine gross changes in direction that occurred as an indication of change of mind behaviour.
We also measured a second, related, factor of decision variability using the discrete (Fréchet)
distance (equation 3). This function measures the similarity between two curved trajectories to find
the minimum distance that connects each line (Eiter and Mannila, 1994; Fréchet, 1906).

This is commonly referred to as the “walking-dog distance”, as it can be understood as the
minimum length of leash that would be required for a man walking his dog if each were on the
separate paths (Eiter and Mannila, 1994; Fréchet, 1906). We first time-normalised each trial to 101
time-points and remapped the trajectories going to the left door to the right door (or vice versa), as
common in mouse tracking studies (Freeman et al., 2011). We excluded from the analysis x-flip
trials, as these would lead to abnormally large peaks in distance. We calculated an average
trajectory for each participant, in each condition and room, and then, on each trial, calculated the
discrete Fréchet distance between the trial trajectory and the average trajectory for the context. We
expected that if the availability of an alternative option (the non-selected door) remained actively
considered then this would result in greater variability in decision trajectories in the 2-Choice room
than the 1-Choice room. Group differences in x-flips and Fréchet distance were determined using
2x5s ANOVA of Choice Availability and Value, organised from comparatively least valuable to
most valuable for the chosen room on that trial. Two sets of 2x5 ANOVAs were performed, in order
to compare trajectories first in the 1-Choice and 2-Choice Rooms, then in the first room, on the
basis of whether the 1-Choice or 2-Choice room was chosen.
Experimental task 2: decision between 4-Choice vs. 3-Choice rooms
Participants
criteria were that participants be of at least 18 years of age. Fourteen participants were excluded
for failing to properly follow task instructions, and data from the remaining 36 participants were
used for the behavioural analyses (16 female, mean age 21.8 years, range 18-24 years).
Participants were monetarily compensated for their time. The Ethics committee of the National
Research Council approved the experiment.
Task design
Experimental task 2 has the same design as Experimental task 1, but in the first room, one
door always led to a room that had four doors available (4-Choice), whereas the other door always
led to a room that had only one door closed (3-Choice). As in experimental task 1, one of the
rooms (the 4-Choice room) is associated with higher entropy over outcomes than the other (3-
Choice) room and the closed door in the 3-Choice room changed on a trial-by-trial basis. The task
mobile phones. The structure of the virtual environment was the same as Experimental task 1, but
some graphical elements were different to be adapted to mobile phones and participants
performed the task using a virtual analog controller, rather than a keyboard.
As in Experimental task 1, we included the two factors of Choice Availability and Value. Like
Experimental task 1, we used two conditions of Choice Availability (4-Choice and 3-Choice).
However, we only included three (rather than five) conditions of Value, to keep the online
experiment shorter and ensure that data quality did not decrease over time. In the baseline
condition (4C=3C), the value of gems in the 4-Choice and the 3-Choice rooms was the same (M=6
points). In another condition (4C>>3C) the value of the gems in the 4-Choice room was much
greater (M=10 points) than the value of the gems in the 3-Choice room. In the last condition
(3C>>4C), the reverse was true. Furthermore, selecting the locked door did not have any effect,
rather than resulting in a skull cue. The position of rooms was counterbalanced across participants.
This factorial design enabled us to investigate the combined effects of option availability and value
on choice behaviour, when participants selected between a more options compared to
Experimental task 1.
Before the experiment, the participants made 10 practice trials. During the experiment, three
blocks were presented, one for each of the three experimental conditions, counter-balanced for
door position, and each block consisted of 25 trials. Finally, as for experimental task 1, following
each block, participants provided a rating of their perceived level of freedom for the left and right
rooms.
Behavioural analysis
The behavioural analyses followed the same approach as Experimental task 1 and used 2x5
ANOVAs, with two levels of Choice Availability conditions (4-Choice and 3-Choice) and three
Value conditions (4C=3C, 4C>>3C, and 3C>>4C). The significance level was set to p<0.05 for all
the analyses.

Participant choice behaviour
We first analysed choice proportions in favour of the 2-Choice room over the 1-Choice room
across all five conditions of varying relative reward values. If there was no influence of option
availability and participants equally chose each of the two rooms, choice proportions would be 0.5
when the two rooms were equally valuable. If participants exhibited a choice bias, the proportion in
favour of the 2-Choice room would be >0.5. In the baseline condition, when all rewards were equal,
we found that participants showed a highly significant choice bias, selecting the 2-Choice room on
59% (SE=2%) of trials on average (single-sample t-test difference from 50%: t(26)=3.909,
p<0.001). This bias was further evident when all conditions were analysed collectively, resulting in
an overall choice bias of 58% (SE=1%; t(26)=6.028, p<0.001). This is apparent in the positive shift

greater than 0.5, but they varied in the choice bias intensity.
Furthermore, we quantified the contributions of utility-seeking to each participant’s choice
behaviour, to ensure that participants were overall able to select rewarding outcomes. For this, we
performed a linear regression analysis to predict participant’s choices on each trial on the basis of
comparative value. We found that expected utility significantly influenced behaviour (mean β=0.10,
SE=0.02, t(26)=6.070, p<0.001). Individual β coefficients for each participant are displayed in

almost all participants. Finally, we asked whether the drive for entropy gain led to a detriment in the
reward gained by each participant. We correlated the choice bias for each participant with the β
coefficient for utility gain and found no relationship (Pearson R=0.01, p=0.96). Hence, entropy-
maximising behaviour was not associated with a trade-off in utilitarian gain.

evidenced by a greater proportion of choices for the 2-Choice (2C) room than the 1-Choice (1C) room. This

Model-based predictions
We simulated a simplified Markov decision process model of the task environment in order to
estimate expected behaviour according to expected utility and a representative inference-based
method, active inference, which additionally incorporated entropy maximisation. We simulated only
the first action of selecting between each of the rooms, because this is when the putative entropy-
seeking behaviour may manifest. In our simulations, choosing the 2-Choice room gave a 50%
likelihood of reaching each of two final outcomes, and the 1-Choice room led to one deterministic
outcome.
The two models under scrutiny, utility maximisation and active inference, make opposing
predictions, particularly when the value of two contexts is equal. Specifically, the utility
maximisation model predicts no bias towards either room; whereas the active inference model
predicts a probability of 58% for the 2-Choice room. The latter prediction was a very close match to
the average choice bias of 59% exhibited by participants in our study. Thus, the active inference
model accounts well for the bias towards choice observed in our participants in this paradigm.
Furthermore, we performed model inversion of the participant choice responses according to

significant evidence to support an active inference model of free choice behaviour (Supplementary

choices made in the 2-Choice room were perceived as freer than those in the 1-Choice room (2-
Choice: M=6.9, SE=0.3, 1-Choice: M=5.4, SE=0.4; F(1,26)=10.843, p=0.003). Perceived freedom
was neutral at minimum in the 1-Choice room and positively modulated by the availability of an
alternative option in the 2- Choice room. There was also a main effect of Value, indicating that the
reward available in each room had a positive influence on perceived freedom
(F(1.874,48.722)=5.224, p=0.01). There were no significant interactions. Note that for the statistical

the 2-Choice room (i.e. as the relative value of the 2-Choice room increased) and, conversely,
increasing Free Ratings to the left across conditions for the 1-Choice room (i.e. as relative value of
the 1-Choice room increased).
ratings were reported at the end of each block, from 0 (Not Free) to 10 (Very Free). Conditions are indicated
by comparative value of the rewards. Choices made in the 2-Choice room were perceived as significantly
freer than choices made in the 1-Choice room, where one door was always locked. Gem value also
positively influenced perceived freedom, so that choices in each of the rooms were rated significantly more
highly as the comparative value of gems in the room increased.
Decision trajectory metrics
We first aimed to analyse ‘changes of mind’ demonstrated in the decision trajectories during
navigation by considering large-scale x-flips. In previous mouse-tracking studies of continuous
movement dynamics, x-flips have been reported for minor fluctuations in motion trajectories (Barca
and Pezzulo, 2015, 2012; Dale et al., 2008). However, in our virtual environment, where
movements were smoothly controlled with keyboard button presses, we measured x-flips only to
occurred in each of the final rooms with a 2x5 ANOVA. This revealed a main effect of Choice
Availability, with flips significantly more common in the 1-Choice room (M=6.2%, S.E.=0.9) than the
2-Choice room (M=1.0%, S.E.=0.3; F(1,25)=30.231, p<0.001). There was no significant effect of
Value and no significant interaction. We repeated this analysis for the first room and found no
significant main effects or interactions. Our results thus indicate that participants were more likely
to change their intended course of action in the 1-Choice room with the locked door than the 2-
Choice room and this was independent of the relative reward value. However, overall the
frequency of change of mind decisions was very low.
We next analysed the variability in participant trajectories, using the discrete Fréchet distance

there was significantly greater variability in the 2-Choice room (M=0.44, S.E.=0.01) than the 1-
Choice room (M=0.41, S.E.=0.02; F(1,25)=6.171, p=0.02). We found no significant effect of Value
and no significant interactions. Path variability, indicative of choice deliberation, was therefore
greater when a second door remained available. A 2x5 ANOVA of trajectories in the first room, in
which trials were split according to the final room chosen, showed a significant main effect of Value

Results of Experimental task 2
Participant choice behaviour
We analysed choice proportions in favour of the 4-Choice room over the 3-Choice room across
all three conditions of varying relative reward values. In the baseline condition, when all rewards
were equal, we found that participants showed a significant choice bias, selecting the 4-Choice
room on 59% (SE=3%) of trials on average (single-sample t-test difference from 50%: t(35)=2.822,
was 54% (SE=3%), which does not show significance (t(35)=1.38, p=0.17).
To further examine whether and how many individual participants showed a positive choice

greater than 0.5, but they varied in the choice bias intensity.
Furthermore, we quantified the contributions of utility-seeking to each participant’s choice
behaviour, to ensure that participants were overall able to select rewarding outcomes. For this, we
performed a linear regression analysis to predict participant’s choices on each trial on the basis of
comparative value. We found that expected utility significantly influenced behaviour (mean β=0.17,
SE=0.01, t(35)=23.92, p<0.001). Individual β coefficients for each participant are displayed in

was not associated with a trade-off in utilitarian gain.

9). A 2x3 repeated measures ANOVA revealed a main effect of Choice Availability, in which
choices made in the 4-Choice room were perceived as freer than those in the 3-Choice room (4-
Choice: M=7.47, SE=0.25; 3-Choice: M=6.36, SE=0.29; F(1, 35)=8.198, p=0.005). There was no
main effect of Value, indicating that the reward available in each room had no influence on
perceived freedom. Finally, there was significant interaction between Choice Availability and Value
(F(2,210)=9.486, p<0.001). Post-hoc analysis using Tukey Test showed that choices made in the
4-Choice room in the 4C>>3C condition were perceived as freer than those made in the 3-Choice
room in the 4C=3C condition (p=0.001), that in the 4C>>3C condition, choices made in the 4-
Choice room were perceived as freer than those made in the 3-Choice room (p=0.001), that
choices made in the 3-Choice room in the 4C<<3C were perceived as freer than those made in the
3-Choice room in the 4C=3C condition (p=0.019), and that choices made in the 4-Choice room in
the 4C<<3C condition were perceived as freer than those made in the 4-Choice room in the
4C>>3C condition (p=0.02).
We also asked whether perceived freedom of choice increases with the number of options
available. To answer this question, we considered together the results of Experimental tasks 1 and
2, which asked the same questions about freedom of choice. We performed (Bonferroni-corrected)
t-tests between the 4 conditions of Choice Availability, two (1-Choice and 2-Choice) from
Experimental tasks 1 and two (3-Choice and 4-Choice) from Experimental tasks 2. The Bonferroni-
corrected t-tests confirmed that choices made in the 4-Choice room were perceived as freer than
those in the 3-Choice room (p=0.027) and that choices made in the 2-Choice room were perceived
as freer than those in the 1-Choice room (p=0.0002), as reported above. Furthermore, they
showed that that choices made in the 4-Choice room were perceived as freer than those in the 1-
Choice room (p=0.000). No other comparisons were significant. Fianally, we did not find a linear

Decision trajectory metrics
We aimed to analyse ‘changes of mind’ and the x-flips that occurred in each of the final rooms,
with a 2x3 ANOVA. This revealed a main effect of Choice Availability, with flips significantly more
common in the 3-Choice room (M=13.7%, S.E.= 2.1) than the 4-Choice room (M=5.7%, S.E.=0.3;
F(1,35)=13.705, p<0.001). There was no significant effect of Value and no significant interaction.
We repeated this analysis for the first room and found no significant main effects or interactions.
Our results indicate that participants were more likely to change their intended course of action in
the 3-Choice room with the locked door than the 4-Choice room and this was independent of the
relative reward value. However, overall, the frequency of change of mind decisions was very low.
We next analysed the variability in participant trajectories, using the discrete Fréchet distance to
measure the average deviation from the mean trajectory in each context. A 2x3 ANOVA of the
trajectories in the final rooms showed a main effect of Choice Availability, with greater variability for
the the 3-Choice room (M=7.25, S.E.=0.37) compared to the 4-Choice room (M=6.63, S.E.=0.79;
F(1,35)=3.958, p=0.047). We found no significant effect of Value but significant interaction
between Choice Availability and Value (p<0.001). Post-hoc analysis using Tukey Test showed that
the trajectory variability in the 4-Choice room was significantly greater in the 4C>>3C condition
compared to the 4C<<3C condition (p=0.0004); the variability was significantly greater in the 3-
Choice compared to the 4-Choice room in the 4C<<3C condition (p=0.002); and the variability of
the 3-Choice room in the 4C=3C condition was significantly greater than the 4-Choice room in the
4C<<3C condition (p=0.006). A 2x3 ANOVA of trajectories was ran also for the first room, in which
trials were split according to the final room chosen: no significant main effect of Value, of Choice
Availability and interactions were found.
Discussion
We examined free choice behaviour in the context of two sequential choice tasks in which
participants navigated through virtual rooms in order to reach reward locations. We report three
main findings. First, we found evidence for entropy maximization (i.e., a "choice bias") above and
beyond utility maximization during participants' sequential choices. Second, participants reported
feeling a greater freedom of choice when more choice options were available. Third, we found that
the ongoing consideration of alternative options (when available) was evident in the manner in
which participants navigated the virtual environment. We discuss these three findings below.
Evidence for entropy maximization during sequential choices
We found that during the choice between rooms that gave access to one versus two choices
(Experimental task 1) and between rooms that gave access to three versus four choices
(Experimental task 2), participants were biased towards the rooms that gave access to more
choices – or in other words, the rooms in which they could “keep their options open”. In both
experimental tasks, the "choice bias" was evident when the rooms to be selected were equally
valuable, effectively acting as a choice (entropy) bonus that influenced action selection, above and
beyond reward achievement. In Experimental task 1, but not Experimental task 2, the choice bias
was also significant across all conditions, when rooms had unbalanced values. The choice bias
was not only a group-level phenomenon, but was apparent across almost all participants of
Experiment 1 (with the only exception being a few participants that showed no bias) and in the
large majority of participants of Experiment 2 (with a few participants showing the opposite bias).
Furthermore, the choice bias did not hinder reward-seeking behaviour. Taken together, these
results support models of decision-making in which utility and entropy are optimized together,
rather than classical models that focus exclusively on utility maximization. To gather extra support
for this idea, we implemented an inference-based computational model that uses both utility and
entropy and showed that it better accounts for choice behaviour (in Experimental task 1) than a
model based on expected utility alone. Notably, based on our model parameterisation, the degree
of choice bias predicted by the inference model of the task very closely matched the observed
participant bias. Therefore, the inclusion of entropy maximisation could account for choice
behaviour in situations where a drive for utilitarian value alone fails to explain observations.
Choice bias has classically been reported using a choice preference task, in which participants
choose between one action that leads directly to an outcome or an action that provides further
choice (Bown et al., 2003; Catania, 1975; Fujiwara et al., 2013; Leotti and Delgado, 2011; Ono,
2000; Suzuki, 1999, 1997). These studies have typically reported a bias of approximately two-
thirds, whereby participants selected the choice providing two options twice as often as the choice
leading to only one option. We first wanted to ensure that this classical finding was not the result of
participants equally sampling each of the three possible outcomes. To address this, our tasks were
designed with four (Experimental task 1) or eight (Experimental task 2) final goal states overall but
with the comparative number of available options conserved on each trial, specifically two options
versus one (Experimental task 1) or four options versus three. If the choice bias previously
reported was driven only by equal selection of each outcome state, the proportion of choices for
the 2-Choice room (Experimental task 1) or the 4-Choice room (Experimental task 2) would be 0.5
whereas preference for choice would result in a positive bias. We found that choice was preferred
in both Experimental tasks, as evident in the shift towards choosing the room with more doors
available. Thus, we found similar bias to previous studies even when accounting for differences in
the number of goal outcomes, which provides strong support for the observation that participants
seek contexts that provide choice.
A previous study by Schwartenbeck et al. (2015) reported a preference for choice in a binary
choice paradigm in which participants could chose between two offers containing between one and
four different snacks - and knew that one of the snacks of the selected offer would have been
selected randomly and possibly received at the end of the study. The study found that participants
preferred options that provided a higher numbers of items, even when choosing the smaller set
would have led to an increased likelihood of attaining the most valuable item. Furthermore, similar
to our study, participants' choice behavior could be explained more accurately with an inference-
based model that considers both utility and entropy than expected utility theory alone. However,
while this study supports the idea that preference for choice can be accounted for with an
inferential framework, it addressed only a simple one-step choice scenario in which the selection of
high entropy states had no influence on the availability of future choices. Rather, choices in the
task resulted in one outcome on completion of the task that was taken at random from a set,
meaning that entropy maximisation did not consequentially affect the outcomes attained.
Furthermore, the study of Schwartenbeck et al. (2015) could not fully disentangle whether
preference for future options is related to entropy maximisation, as opposed to simply resulting
from equal sampling of each end state. Specifically, the reported choice bias of approximately two-
thirds has corresponded to the choice leading to two options being selected twice as often as the
choice leading to one option. Our study addresses the above limitations by using a sequential
choice design, in which the first choice translates into more or less subsequent choice availability
(rather than to the random selection of one outcome) and by controlling for the number of possible
states to be explored (which are the same in the 1-Choice and 2-Choice rooms and in the 3-
Choice and 4-Choice rooms), therefore providing additional support for the idea that entropy
maximization is a significant consideration in guiding ongoing choice behaviour.
Preference for choice has been proposed to exist as an inherent drive that motivates an agent
to seek optimal states in the environment (Leotti et al., 2010; Leotti and Delgado, 2011). Similarly,
inference-based models suggest that agents are driven to select high entropy states as a means of
maximising the likelihood of expected outcomes (Friston, 2010; Pezzulo et al., 2015), or optimising
decision-making without requiring a laborious, and often unfeasible, assessment of the values of
all available actions (Schwartenbeck et al., 2015; Volz and Gigerenzer, 2012). This is particularly
crucial in real-world environments, where the availability of options changes over time (Cisek and
Kalaska, 2010; Klyubin et al., 2008; Lepora and Pezzulo, 2015). Maximising for entropy as well as
utility may therefore serve to enhance the adaptive control an agent maintains over future
outcomes as it navigates an uncertain world (Klyubin et al., 2008; Lancia et al., 2022; Pezzulo and
Ognibene, 2011; Rick and Loewenstein, 2008; Schwartenbeck et al., 2015). In our task,
participants experienced a simplified version of navigating a virtual world with uncertainty. Our
findings support these theories by demonstrating a bias for higher entropy states, which however
does not hinder reward-seeking, therefore offering a novel perspective that accounts for choice
preference as a means of optimising for the availability of future possibilities.
One question raised by our study regards the differences between some of the results of the
two experiments. In both experiments, we found a choice bias in the case of two rooms with the
same (average) value. However, we only found an overall choice bias across all conditions in the
first experiment. On the one hand, the fact that the choice bias is present in the most discriminative
condition (that is, when entropy maximization is not confounded by utility considerations) is
reassuring. On the other hand, the difference between the two experiments suggests that entropy
and utility factors might interact in complex ways to determine choices or that the availability of a
single choice (i.e., the 1-Choice room in Experimental task 1) should be considered as a special
case, in which considerations of entropy are more prominent. These and other hypotheses remain
to be tested in future studies.
Another research question regards the possibility that states with excessive levels of entropy
and choice availability could be less preferred rather than more preferred, as found in our study.
Previous research has demonstrated that too many choices could provide a choice overload,
avoidance and loss of motivation (Iyengar and Lepper, 2000) but it is unclear what is the point at
which choices become excessive and how to integrate the preference for choice and choice
overload in the same computational model.
Greater freedom of choice with more choice options available
In both Experimental Tasks 1 and 2, we found that the availability of choice significantly
influenced participants’ perceived freedom of choice, whereas reward value significantly influenced
perceived freedom of choice only in Experimental task 1. The fact that in both experiments
participants reported having more freedom of choice in rooms where more options were available
supports the idea that the feeling of having free will could be intimately related to choice
availability. Further support for this idea comes from the fact that, when combining the results of
both experiments (which used the same experimental questions), we found that choices made in
the 4-Choice room were perceived as freer than those in the 1-Choice room. However, our results
suggest that choice availability does not scale linearly with the number of choices, hence their
specific relations remain to be investigated in future studies.
Availability of choice has long been a central theme in modern views of free will (Banja, 2015;
Monroe and Malle, 2009). Our results further show that in both Experimental tasks, participants not
only preferentially chose states with greater choice availability, but reported higher perceived
freedom in this context. This is in accordance with previous findings suggesting that the subjective
experience of free choice corresponds to the availability of an alternative option (Rens et al., 2018)
or the perception of having a higher number of options available (Filevich et al., 2013). We also
found that in Experimental task 1 (but not Experimental task 2), comparative reward value
positively influenced perceived freedom. Libertarian views of free will emphasise the ability to
choose any available option and, therefore, regard reward as a negative constraint on the freedom
an individual has to choose (Schultz, 2015). However, others have indicated that the value of
outcomes influences the perception of freedom during free choice; for example participants
reported being freer when choosing between two equally good than two equally bad options (Lau
et al., 2015; Lau and Wenzel, 2015). Our finding of a positive relationship between the value of
decision outcomes and subjective freedom could lend some support the latter view; however,
given that this relationship was only apparent in Experimental task 1 suggests that more evidence
is needed to adjudicate between the alternative views.
Choice availability influences ongoing decision dynamics
As we recorded (virtual) path trajectories during the choice, our experiments permit asking how
choice availability influences participants' ongoing decision dynamics. We found that in both
Experimental Tasks 1 and 2, participants were more likely to change their decision course in the
rooms with the locked doors; but note that such 'changes of mind' were rare. The most likely
explanation for this is that, at least on occasion, participants forward-planned the final choice prior
to entering the second room, and subsequently had to change course upon discovering that their
chosen door was locked. This finding would have been unlikely had participants made two
independent sequential choices, waiting to enter the second room before choosing left or right
again. Alternatively, participants either did not readily perceive which door was locked or did not
pay attention to the room orientation. However, this is not implied by other findings such as the
choice bias and the good performance of participants. Both reinforcement learning and inference-
based models propose that participants rely on forward planning (Botvinick and Toussaint, 2012;
Daw et al., 2011; Pezzulo et al., 2017, 2014; Pezzulo and Ognibene, 2011; Redish, 2016; Simon
and Daw, 2011; Stoianov et al., 2022), but this has been challenging to evidence behaviourally.
Our findings suggest that participants could have planned for the final goal location in advance, but
maintained a malleable state of decision preparation and revised their plan as necessary.
A further indication of malleability in decision-making comes from the finding that participants’
path trajectories in Experimental task 1 showed more variability when an alternative option
remained available (i.e., in the 2-Choice room) compared to the case of no alternatives (i.e., in the
1-Choice room), indicating ongoing choice consideration during the trial. In Experimental task 1,
path variability was also greatest in the first room when the comparative value of each of the
subsequent rooms was equal or relatively similar, thus rendering the choice more uncertain and
difficult. As the door leading to reward was only reached at the end of the subsequent decision,
this suggests participants actively deliberated access to future reward during preparation of their
immediate actions. However, we found that path variability is not a simple function of the number
of choices available. The results of Experimental task 2 indicate that participants show greater
movement variability in the (3-Choice) room that provides fewer options. Yet, it is important to note
that different from Experiment 1, in Experiment 2 both rooms gave access to multiple options,
therefore affording continuous deliberation. Therefore, while the two experiments suggest that
choice availability (versus not availability) promotes greater variability of movement, it remains to
be fully assessed how the variability depends on various factors, such as the number of options,
their values, their geometric arrangement, or others.
The above findings resonate well with numerous other studies tracking decision-making
dynamics that report that choices are not completed before initiating an action, and that
movements become more variable as a function of choice uncertainty (Dale et al., 2008, 2008;
Flumini et al., 2015; Freeman et al., 2011; McKinstry et al., 2008; Pezzulo et al., 2018; Song and
Nakayama, 2009). Embodied theories of cognition propose that all available action plans are
proactively primed, permitting an agent to act adaptively in the environment even before full
evidence towards one action is gathered (Cisek, 2007; Cisek and Kalaska, 2010; Lepora and
Pezzulo, 2015; Pezzulo and Cisek, 2016; Stanford et al., 2010). The flexibility of preparation has
been also suggested to be a hallmark of free decisions (Fleming et al., 2009; Salvaris and
Haggard, 2014). In keeping, a previous study has shown that, while free choices can be predicted
from neural activity, neural encoding of options and visual attention both indicate that alternative
options remain online during free choice preparation (Rens et al., 2018). Finally, delaying
commitment to a particular outcome may also allow an individual greater time to accrue evidence,
particular in dynamic contexts (Bown et al., 2003; Lepora and Pezzulo, 2015; Pezzulo and
Ognibene, 2011; Weld, 1994). In our Experimental tasks, there was no objective difference in the
reward that could be gained from either door but, nevertheless, participants may have sought to
optimise their outcomes based on perceived trial-to-trial changes in valuation. In sum, actively
seeking states of higher entropy might constitute an adaptive strategy in ecological conditions.
There are a few considerations to take into account in this study. First, the tasks were designed
to ensure that there were four (or eight) goal locations for participants to choose between. This
was important to verify that any choice bias reported was not the result of equal outcome sampling.
Our participants’ behaviour suggests that they did plan ahead for the final doors but, as a result,
appear to have been forced to occasionally change decisions when a door was locked. This
scenario is not equivalent to a single option existing, as avoidance of the locked door (or skull cue
hidden behind in Experimental task 1), could arguably have been perceived as an external
constraint to a planned choice. A possibility, therefore, is that the perceived cognitive load of
having to choose the one available door in the 1-Choice room (or the 3-Choice room) was
experienced as a higher cost, or inverse value, leading the 2-Choice room (or the 4-Choice room)
to be more preferable. The inference-based entropy maximisation may then also be interpreted as
participants acting according to optimal cost-to-go policies (Todorov, 2009). Nevertheless,
subjective reports did not indicate an absence of perceived freedom in the 1-Choice or the 3-
Choice rooms, which we would have expected if participants felt negatively about this state or
unable to make their desired choice. Second, the model we built is a simplified version of the task
environment, which considers the key factor of choice availability but does not take into account
any behavior related to learning or trial-to-trial reward variance. Therefore, this model could be
further improved in the future to more fully account for decision behaviour.
In summary, in two experiments, we found evidence of entropy maximisation in free choice
behaviour, suggesting that individuals are driven to maximise entropy in addition to utility, by
actively seeking conditions in which several options are available. Findings of choice preference
have previously been difficult to reconcile with purely economic theories of decision-making. The
present results provide a novel perspective accounting for choice bias as entropy gain within an
inferential perspective of voluntary decision-making. Tracking the time course of the decision
suggests that participants used forward planning to make two consecutive decisions, while at the
same time demonstrating flexibility in ongoing option consideration. Finally, we found that choice
availability and (in one experiment) utility promoted a subjective sense of free will. This raises the
possibility that the subjective experience of free choice could be related to a proactive process of
inference of action possibilities and their outcomes. Taken together, our results from behavioural,
physical, and subjective measures emphasise the central role proactive choice plays in free
decisions and contribute to a theory of free choice behaviour as optimal decision-making in a
dynamic world.
