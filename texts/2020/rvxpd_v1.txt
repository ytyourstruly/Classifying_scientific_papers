Abstract
The paper investigates the impact of the use of metaphors in reasoning tasks concerning
vaccination, especially for defeasible reasoning cases. We assumed that both metaphor and
defeasible reasoning can be relevant to let people understand vaccination as an important
collective health phenomenon, by anticipating possible defeating conditions. We hypothesized
that extended metaphor could improve both the argumentative and the communicative effects
of the message. We designed an empirical study to test our main hypotheses: participants were
presented with a text about vaccination, described in either literal or metaphorical terms, based
on uncertain vs. safe reasoning scenarios. The results of the study confirmed that defeasible
reasoning is relevant for the communicative impact of a text and that an extended metaphor
enhances the overall communicative effects of the message, in terms of understandability,
persuasion, perceived safety and feeling of control over the health situation, collective trust in
expertise and uptake of experts’ advice. However, the results show that this effect is
significantly nuanced by the type of defeasible reasoning, especially in the case of participant’s
trust in expertise and commitment to experts’ advice.

1. Introduction
In times of COVID-19 pandemic, the promotion of collective vaccination in
institutional campaigns is of utmost importance. It is crucial for public health to make the vital
need for collective vaccination as much clear as possible especially to hesitant people, as
COVID-19 vaccination is on a voluntary basis in most countries. Vaccine hesitancy is indeed
an important issue to be addressed in institutional communication, especially in the context of
a decrease in vaccination coverage and control of vaccine-preventable diseases. Even though it
might be non-determinant for the individuals’ care decision and behavior [35], an inadequate
institutional communication might contribute to vaccine hesitancy and negatively influence the
collective vaccination uptake. This issue is even more delicate as “recent debates about the risks
suggest that public trust in immunization programmes is fragile” [7, p. 9] and possibly
influenced by “media logic” rather than “epidemiological logic”, with consequent loss of trust
in public health authorities [43; 47; 23]. For instance, Peretti-Watel and colleagues [43] studied
the “Pandemic Public Health Paradox” during the first pandemic of the 21st century (influenza
A H1N1 in 2009), i.e. the unexpected low vaccination rates at the onset of the second, most
fatal, epidemic wave. Interestingly, they showed that the vaccination rates trends followed the
decline of media attention for the disease, which influenced public risk perceptions and
behaviors long before the epidemic’s peak. As pointed out by Biasio and colleagues [3, p. 2986],
“communication based on valid and shared strategies, as well as on coherent behaviors, can
modify the attitudes toward vaccinations, becoming one of the main components of the global
strategy to oppose vaccine hesitancy”.
Patients’ understanding of vaccination as a fundamental preventive measure should be
considered as a priority in institutional communication about vaccination. Metaphors might be
useful pedagogical devices in vaccine communication to explain a health phenomenon, which
otherwise might remain unintelligible to laypeople. Metaphor can indeed be a way to grasp an
unknown/less known concept (the target) by using a better-known concept (the source) [30; 8].
Metaphors in health communication have been widely studied, especially in the case of cancer,
and sometimes also criticized to the point of proposing “a liberation from them” [60, p. 4] as
violent uses of language for people suffering from cancer treatments. A variety of metaphors
have been proposed also in vaccine communication, ranging from the conventional military
metaphor of the “garrison” to the novel metaphor of the “beehive” to let people understand the
concept of “herd immunity” without making people feel mindless sheeps following the flock
[5; 15]. Each metaphor provides a specific perspective to interpret both the disease and its
Preprint version submitted on December 30, 2020
development, as it entails a framing effect on the health phenomenon to be explained [56; 56].
However, it is not clear whether and which metaphorical frames have more chances to be
successful in vaccine communication to achieve population’s compliance in the management
of vaccine-preventable diseases. Indeed, in the case of vaccination, we may even wonder
whether metaphors are effective devices for patients’ education or whether literal
communication on vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases might be preferable to implicit
metaphorical communicated content.
Exposure to metaphorical framing proved capable to modify how people reason about
a specific social problem [66; 67] (but see [64] for criticism), also in the case of metaphors used
in vaccine communication [54]. In metaphor framing studies, participants are usually presented
with a metaphorical (vs. non‐metaphorical) description of a target issue and then asked to make
a judgment or a decision on the target to check whether it is influenced by the metaphorical
frame provided by the text. Thibodeau and Borodisky [66, p. 1] stated that “even the subtlest
instantiation of a metaphor (via a single word) can have a powerful influence over how people
attempt to solve social problems”, even when presented with possible alternatives after reading
the text [67]. But later on, Steen and colleagues [64] addressed some criticisms to their studies,
which actually presented to participants extended metaphors or anyway metaphors reinforced
by possible metaphorical readings of other words in the text without a control (literal or “neutral
framed”) condition. Steen and colleagues therefore proposed a series of follow-up studies, also
presenting texts with no additional support for the metaphoric frame, adding a non-metaphorical
control condition, and previously measuring the political preferences of the participants. They
found neither effects of the metaphorical frame nor of the metaphorical support on reasoning.
They concluded that an increased media attention and/or a simple text exposure to the issue as
a relevant social problem finally influenced the policy preferences. Interestingly, they also
found that the (conventional) metaphors like “beast” and “virus” did not “surpass a non-
metaphorical frame in terms of prominence or attention” [64, p. 21], while the metaphorical
support increases the activation, and thus the prominence of the metaphorical frame. They
finally suggested that novelty, artfulness or deliberateness of a metaphor might play a major
role in enhancing the metaphorical processing as well as the communicative effects of the text.
While Thibodeau and Borodisky [66] focused on conventional metaphors, Scherer and
colleagues (2015) also presented texts with novel metaphors for their study on the metaphorical
framing effect of flu description on vaccination intentions. They anyway found no significant
difference on the metaphorical framing on vaccination intentions, “with novel and conventional
metaphors all increasing vaccination intentions” [54, p. 44]. Though the metaphors were
Preprint version submitted on December 30, 2020
extended along the text via a relevant metaphorical property, the texts presented to participants
were focused on the description of the flu in a reasoning situation that was consistent with the
metaphorical frame. In other words, participants’ disposition to get vaccinated was assessed via
the reading of a text that did not bring participants to question the metaphorical frame and/or
the relevant metaphorical property. As the results of the study showed, such reasoning scenarios
do not change the (either against or in favor of vaccination) beliefs on vaccination participants
already strongly held, while having some impact on people who occasionally got vaccination.
However, in every-day life specific reasoning situations are widespread where laypeople
question the (either metaphorical or literal) description of vaccination, possibly leading to
undesired conclusions on vaccination as a collaborative endeavor. Some specific reasoning
scenarios may indeed defeat conclusions about the necessity for vaccination to be collective,
presenting further premises ranging from the phenomenon of single “free riders” to entire anti-
vaccination communities. Such specific defeasible reasoning situations where vaccination is
metaphorically described as collaborative have not been tested and are indeed relevant to
understand whether and how metaphor interpretation interacts with the argumentative
scaffolding of pro-vaccination texts. Especially when intentionally used, metaphors are
supposed to be highly relevant in a variety of argumentative discourse structures [73; 74], but
they have not yet been tested for their communicative power in defeasible reasoning situations,
as required by a full understanding of vaccination as a collaborative phenomenon.
Reasoning about vaccination can thus be fruitfully approached by trying to highlight the
role that certain premises play in it. In fact, depending on certain premises, a pattern of inference
can be more or less exposed to uncertainty: ordinary reasoning is usually defeasible, but within
a certain set of premises, there are premises that are in principle more likely to put the
conclusion into question, or even defeat it [29, 44, 45]. Certain sets of premises can indeed be
more or less consistent, and when slight (or even serious, depending on the context)
inconsistencies show up, the reasoning can be exposed to uncertainty and the conclusion can
be (temporarily) retracted. These premises may become, in these situations, potentially
invalidating conditions for the reasoning process, possibly leading to a retraction of the
conclusion. For example, consider a generic set of premises, such as the fact X; the fact Y; and
its conclusion: the foreseen outcome O. This set of premises (X,Y) can be seen as the
unproblematic (or “safe”) case, where the expected outcome (O) is likely to happen. If we add
a new premise, call it “the fact Z”, which can alter the consistency of the set of premises, the
reasoning task would get complicated, even requiring tentative solutions. These complications
in the reasoning task require some means to explore the role of certain premises. Metaphor here
Preprint version submitted on December 30, 2020
is a potentially useful reasoning device to interpret the new premises, to facilitate and implicitly
check the consistency of the premises within the set, and eventually accomplish the reasoning
task: either by defeating the former conclusion or by temporarily retracting it waiting for further
clues. However, no empirical study on the effects of metaphor concerning reasoning about
vaccination, has been conducted. The study presented in the paper aims to fill this gap, by
investigating whether a metaphor intentionally used to provide the readers with a perspective
on vaccination as a collaborative health phenomenon, might enhance the communicative effects
of a text based on reasoning about collective vaccination.
2. Theoretical background
The first assumption is that ordinary reasoning, and therefore also reasoning about
vaccination, is exposed to uncertainty (section 2.1). The second assumption is that metaphor is
a reasoning device to better understand the target, i.e. vaccination as a collective health
phenomenon [15] (section 2.2).
2.1 Uncertainty and reasoning in vaccine communication
Vaccine hesitancy and vaccine communication present a number of challenges to
doctors’ expertise. Some of these challenges comprise reasoning about vaccination as a
collective endeavor. Certain reasoning tasks, concerning sets of premises whose consistency is
not fully explicit, usually require a major effort to evaluate the conclusions. These cases can be
called uncertain scenarios. This type of reasoning is usually framed in terms of defeasible
reasoning, and these premises are usually defined as defeaters, as they defeat the conclusion of
the argument [29, 44, 45]. In uncertain reasoning scenarios, some relevant premises have the
potential logical role of defeaters, even if they do not actually defeat any conclusion on the
necessity of vaccination as a collective effort. We therefore treat these cases as uncertain
scenarios where defeats, if any, are yet to be established. A reasoning is uncertain when the
presence or absence of a certain premise (or set of premises) is in general liable to alter, or even
to put into question, its conclusion. This means that its conclusion does not necessarily follow
from certain premises: if the premise P usually allows to conclude C, a further premise F may
defeat that reasoning; so, while the inference from P to C is good in relatively easy scenarios,
the eventual presence of F may defeat that transition, and C does not follow anymore, or at least
it requires more effort on the side of the reasoner for proper assessment.
Preprint version submitted on December 30, 2020
The fact that a premise may defeat a reasoning, or make it uncertain, can be a problem
as there is no warrant that this fact is known in advance. An example is the following:
“collective vaccination is effective in assuring that an unvaccinated child stays safe; Dave is an
unvaccinated child; hence, Dave can stay safe”. This is a relatively certain scenario, and a quite
easy-going reasoning task. However, if we add certain premises, this conclusion may become
uncertain, and can even be temporarily retracted. For example, we can add these premises:
“Dave lives in a community with a high rate of vaccine hesitancy; an unvaccinated person
cannot stay safe in a context of vaccine hesitancy”. These additional premises reshape the
reasoning, to the point of defeating its conclusion. This reasoning would now involve a different
series of steps: “collective vaccination is effective in assuring that an unvaccinated child stays
safe; Dave is an unvaccinated child; Dave lives in a community with a high rate of vaccine
hesitancy; an unvaccinated person cannot stay safe in a context of vaccine hesitancy”; hence,
the conclusion “Dave can stay safe” does not follow anymore. The additional premises, that
Dave lives in a community with a high rate of vaccine hesitancy and so forth, alter the set of
premises, and defeat the conclusion that we formerly were entitled to draw [44, 45]. As this
example shows, certain premises can systematically alter a more easier reasoning scenario
making it uncertain and liable to be defeated. These potential complications can indeed lead to
temporary retraction of a conclusion, or to its global defeat.
We can distinguish two main roles that premises may play in uncertain scenarios: (a)
premises that are liable to undercut the inference to a conclusion (U), as they may provide
reasons that question the goodness of a conditional, and (b) premises that are liable to rebut the
conclusion (R), as they may provide reasons that directly question a conclusion:
(a) The first role concerns the possibility of questioning the goodness of a general relation
between certain premises and a particular conclusion. Consider a general connection between
a premise and a conclusion: usually collective vaccination lets unvaccinated children stay safe.
This can be rephrased as a conditional claim: if an unvaccinated child is protected by collective
vaccination, then she can stay safe. We might question the goodness of this conditional: in
principle everybody should be vaccinated and an unvaccinated child can stay safe as long as
vaccination is collective. However, if everyone thinks that their child can be unvaccinated and
anyway stay safe, the goodness of the inference will be undercut (U): vaccination would be no
more collective and unvaccinated children could not stay safe. Paradoxically, as in the case of
single “free riders”, they can take advantage of vaccination without being vaccinated, as long
as they do not undermine the need for vaccination to be collective.

(b) The second role consists of a prima facie reason to directly question the conclusion of an
inference. For example, Alice believes that collective vaccination protects also unvaccinated
people and concludes that unvaccinated children can stay safe. However, Alice learns about
Aldo, a child suffering from a serious pathology, who cannot get vaccinated and cannot stay
safe since people around him are not vaccinated. Hence, the actual presence of unvaccinated
people in Aldo’s community is a fact that counts as a premise to be handled with care in
reasoning about vaccination. If unvaccinated people are the majority, the premise can become
the basis to directly rebut (R) Alice’s conclusion.
The different roles of premises in reasoning about vaccination also shows that, depending on
the proportion of unvaccinated people, our reasoning path can be more or less nuanced.
Reasoning on a single unvaccinated child and reasoning on the fact that Aldo, the unvaccinated
little boy, is surrounded by antivaccinists, makes a relevant difference. In the latter case, we can
seriously reconsider the connection between collective vaccination and safety for unvaccinated
individuals as reliable. So, premises that threaten to defeat a conditional are potentially more
revisionary in scope, while premises liable to rebut a conclusion may highlight some local
problems in our reasoning as we may discover that such conclusion actually does not follow
[29].
Medical expertise involves navigating across a web of potential invalidating conditions,
which create epistemically uncertain scenarios. This equals almost to a proviso that premises
are to be handled with special care within these reasoning tasks. Therefore, medical expertise,
in the context of uncertain reasoning tasks, consists of the abilities to identify the correct
connections between safer and more uncertain premises, and to rule out the potential
invalidating conditions for the expert’s hypotheses (and not only in cases concerning
vaccination). Many factors can be helpful in such uncertain scenarios: the usual route is
provided by procedures of belief-revision between interlocutors, where their dialogue is an
implicit means in order to check the mutual goodness and consistency of one’s beliefs. This is
a reliable way to understand how we manage to improve our reasoning skills, but it is not easy,
and it is also fallible. However, an interesting alternative option may come from recent studies
on metaphor as a reasoning device in argumentative texts.
2.2 Metaphor as a reasoning device
In the case of institutional communication aiming at improving the vaccination rates, it
is of outstanding importance to let people understand how experts handle reasoning about
Preprint version submitted on December 30, 2020
vaccination in uncertain scenarios. Metaphor might be a good candidate to let people grasp how
vaccination works at a collective level and reason about the many ways the individual adherence
to the therapy might affect the collective endeavor of vaccination, in the perspective of a shared
health responsibility. In this perspective, metaphors need to be carefully selected based on their
potentiality to fit (or even enhance) the reasoning required by an argumentative discourse on
diagnosis and consequent need for therapy adherence in the case of vaccine-preventable
diseases. Based on traditional approaches to metaphor in science [6; 26], we consider metaphor
as a reasoning device guiding the readers along a path of inferences to a conclusion, which
attributes to the target some relevant properties of the source [41; 16].
Previous literature pointed out that selecting a source instead of another to construct a
metaphor is never neutral in terms of the reasoning process it prompts (see [69] for a review),
as it implicitly provides a specific perspective under which to interpret the target, “often
including specific attitudes and evaluations” [57]. Most studies on metaphor framing are based
on the conceptual theory of metaphor (CMT), whose authors claimed that metaphor is grounded
in our embodied experience of the world [30] and therefore shapes how we reason about the
world [31]. Far from being a mere embellishment of the text, metaphor proved to covertly
influence how people reason and “gather information to make ‘well-informed’ decisions” [66,
p. 10] about important and complex social issues, such as crime. Also, in the field of health
communication, Hauser and Schwarz [25] found that, when compared to neutral frames,
framing cancer as an enemy reduces patients’ intentions to limit behaviors considered correlated
to cancer likelihood. Interestingly, in the case of vaccination, Scherer and colleagues [54] found
that other metaphorical frames of the flu (described as beast, riot, army or weed) did increase
the intentions to get vaccinated when compared to a non-metaphorical frame (virus).
However, as previously pointed out [22; 36; 39; 46], evidence was rarely found for
knowledge transfer across domains unless a reasoner has some instruction to do so. On the
contrary, within the domain of everyday dilemmas, strong framing effects were reported for the
kind of reasoning required by the text (see for instance [72], on a dilemma involving a disease
outbreak). Interestingly, in a metaphor-based task for the resolution of dilemmas, metaphors
proved to have no (or even undesired) communicative effects, especially when increasing
ambiguity or uncertain reasoning [50]. The specific line of reasoning required to the participants
to solve the dilemma dominated over possible metaphorical inferences on the target: as the
authors concluded, “the metaphor is unnecessary in cases in which a metaphor interferes with
the reasoner’s understanding process” [50, p. 61]. Under this respect, far from scaffolding and
covertly driving reasoning as claimed by Thibodeau and colleagues [68], the reasoner’s
Preprint version submitted on December 30, 2020
understanding process would rather drive the eventual effects of the metaphorical framing. Still,
it is an open question whether and how the reasoning process and the metaphorical framing
might creatively interact. For instance, in simple deductive tasks, Ervas and colleagues [17]
showed that conventional metaphors, whose meaning is lexicalized and so familiar that goes
unnoticed by participants, can be revitalized to hold a plausible conclusion of the argument,
while novel metaphors, whose meaning is so new and creative that are fast recognized as
metaphorical, rather lead to think about alternative conclusions.
Previous studies tested reasoning about “safe” scenarios where participants were asked
to draw a conclusion, and checked where their inferences were influenced by the metaphorical
description of the issue. Scherer and colleagues [54] tested the effects of the metaphorical
framing of flu description on vaccine intentions, without considering different uncertain
reasoning scenarios. No study on the effects of metaphors for vaccination on reasoning in
uncertain scenarios has been conducted, even though it should be required in vaccine
communication especially in times of vaccine hesitancy. Also, the results of corpus studies on
metaphors’ effects in other medical fields are mixed, questioning the role of metaphors as useful
reasoning devices in health communication. Previous studies also looked at metaphor as a
source of ambiguity and misunderstandings, highlighting missed alignments between experts’
and patients’ understanding of metaphors in consultations [58; 34]. Therefore, the question of
the superiority of metaphor over literal language in health communication remains open. It is
still unclear when and how metaphors might be effective reasoning devices to improve patients’
understanding of a specific diagnostic process, as for instance in the case of vaccination, as well
as adherence to therapy.
3. The Study
A promising (but still controversial, see [12; 20; 21; 37; 11] and [2] for criticism) venue
for research on the effects of metaphor in health communication might come from the deliberate
metaphor theory (DMT) [62, 63, 65], whose main proponent revisited CMT, arguing that what
counts in communication is not embodied metaphors per se, but the deliberate use of a metaphor
to draw attention on a target issue with specific communicative aims, i.e. the intentional use of
a metaphor as a metaphor in (argumentative) discourse. For instance, a novel deliberate
metaphor (especially when direct, as for instance when introduced by “like” explicitly
Preprint version submitted on December 30, 2020
prompting a comparison between domains) can be fruitfully employed as a rebuttal analogy in
an argumentative discourse, while a conventional metaphor would not serve this job [73].
As proposed in a previous study [52], a metaphor might be intentionally selected for its
properties as long as it fits the argumentative aims of health communication, to better explain a
(collective) health problem, to make some reasons for a diagnosis clearer, to offer an alternative
view on an illness (or on a system of commonplaces associated with the illness) and/or to solicit
for a belief revision. In this perspective, an argumentatively apt metaphor, i.e. one whose
properties favor the reasoning process required to understand the health issue, might reveal to
be crucial to both diagnosis understanding and adherence to therapy. As the effectiveness of
health communication is intrinsically linked with patient trust [18; 71], an argumentatively apt
metaphor use might turn out to be important not only for a successful expert-patient relationship
but also to the trust in experts and the institution they represent. However, to the best of our
knowledge, no empirical study on the effects of metaphor use on trust on experts and institutions
in the case of vaccine communication in uncertain scenarios has been conducted.
3.1 Experimental Hypotheses
We conducted a study to investigate whether and when a novel metaphor (“the beehive”,
see 5; 15), extended via the relevant property (“cooperative”) for argumentative discourse about
vaccination in uncertain scenarios, can be an effective reasoning and communicative device for
laypeople’s understanding of vaccination as a vital collective endeavor. The study aims at
understanding the communicative effects of metaphors in uncertain reasoning situations, in
terms of persuasion, emotional impact, trust in experts/institutions, and vaccination intentions.
We proposed the following main hypotheses:
H1: A novel metaphor for vaccination, extended via a relevant property for the reasoning task,
entails stronger communicative effects than its literal counterpart, as it is explicitly intended to
make collective vaccination dynamic more intelligible for laypeople.
H2: Reasoning situations concerning uncertain scenarios enhance the comprehension of the text
on vaccination when compared to safe reasoning scenarios, as they make possible defeating
conditions (not envisaged in safe scenarios) explicit.
Preprint version submitted on December 30, 2020
We expected that participants grasped the importance of collective vaccination and health-
related behaviors, especially in uncertain scenarios with potential rebutting defeaters, which
offer a prima facie reason (a fact) to directly question the conclusion.
As extended metaphors were explicitly intended to highlight the target (vaccination),
under an alternative perspective, they drive the reader’s attention toward the conclusion,
especially in the case of premises that are more liable to make the reasoning scenario uncertain.
This function should not be achieved by their literal counterparts, as they do not help per se
defeasible reasoning in providing an alternative perspective. We therefore hypothesized that the
metaphorical frame interacts with the reasoning process type, in the following way:
H3: Extended metaphors are more effective as both communicative and reasoning devices than
their literal counterparts in uncertain scenarios, where reasoning is usually defeasible.
Especially in the case of possible undercutting defeaters, concerning a potential withdrawal of
the main inference, the explicit relevant property of the metaphor for defeasible reasoning might
make it easier for the interlocutor to discern whether the inference is good or bad. Thus, when
the metaphor is extended via a relevant property to support or even enhance the defeasible
reasoning process on vaccination, it can better achieve some communicative effects in the
argumentative discourse, in terms of comprehension, persuasion, and trust in the experts (and
the institutions they represent).
3.2 Design
The empirical study had a 3×2 experimental design: 3 “reasoning” conditions (a. safe
reasoning scenarios; b. uncertain reasoning scenarios - undercutting-type, U; c. uncertain
reasoning scenarios - rebutting-type, R) × 2 “metaphorical frame” conditions (a. metaphor; b.
literal counterpart).
Six group of participants were therefore provided with an argumentative text on
vaccination in the following six conditions:
1) texts presenting a safe reasoning scenario with either a metaphor (MS) or its literal
counterpart (LS);
2) texts presenting an uncertain reasoning scenario (undercutting-type) with either a metaphor
(MU) or its literal counterpart (LU);
3) texts presenting an uncertain reasoning scenario (rebutting-type) with either a metaphor
(MR) or its literal counterpart (LR).

Most participants declared to gather information about vaccination consulting a medical
competent expert (43,1%) or via institutional websites (31,8%); a minority via non-institutional
websites and social networks (3,7%), informal discourses with relatives or friends (5,5%),
scientific journals (6,2%). Some participants declared to be not informed at all about
vaccination (6,9%).
3.4 Material
Previous literature showed that metaphors would encourage people to draw inferences
consistent with the frame provided by the text, especially when the metaphor is put at the
beginning, thus activating the source domain knowledge from where to draw the inferences
[68], and extended along the text [28; 70]. We therefore presented to participants texts where
the metaphor occurs as soon as the description of vaccination is introduced, and is extended via
its relevant property (“collective” in the literal conditions vs. “collaborative” in the
metaphorical conditions) for reasoning about potentially defeating scenarios. The stimulus
material consisted of six argumentative texts on vaccination (one per condition, see
into English, with the potential defeaters in italics and the extended metaphor in bold (as well
as its literal counterpart in the literal conditions).

3.5 Procedure
We collected the data through six different online forms, one for each condition. After
the participants signed the informed consent, the form gathered information about gender, age,
language, and education. The participants were then asked to read the instructions and fill out
a questionnaire, with answers on a 1 to 7 Likert Scale, ranging from 1 as “not at all” to 7 as
“very much”.
In the first part of the questionnaire, all the forms presented the conclusion of the
argumentative texts as a stand-alone sentence (the same for all conditions): “In the context of
health emergencies we are dependent on each other”. The participants were asked to rate how
much they agree with the statement. Then, on a separate screen, the questionnaire presented the
same sentence as the conclusion of the argumentative text (different for each condition, see
premises of the text.

In the second part of the questionnaire, all the forms presented the relative
argumentative text followed by a series of questions, each one on a separate screen. The
questions were focused on text comprehension as well as on its perceived communicative
argumentative texts on vaccination could involve reasoning not only on possible personal
vaccination behavior but also its link with the possible collective vaccination behavior.

Intentions Intentions
First of all, we aimed to measure whether metaphor actually made the texts easier to understand,
though introducing a meaning ambiguity (the literal meaning vs. the metaphorical meaning of
the source). We then selected the measures, and related questions, from previous literature on
the metaphorical framing effects on vaccination [54] in terms of persuasion, perceived control,
and vaccination intentions. In light of possible effects of extended metaphor on source
credibility and trust [1, 9, 10, 48], we added specific measures for participants’ trust on the
expert’s advice, on experts and the institutions they represent, we deemed to be highly relevant
for vaccine communication.
The final section of the questionnaire gathered information about participants’ previous
general vaccination behavior and beliefs about (flu) vaccination, the impact of COVID-19 and
the questionnaire).

A multivariate analysis was performed on the data, having the metaphorical and reasoning
effects of the metaphorical frame and the reasoning situation, as well as the possible interaction
effect of the two factors. The analysis reveals an overall main effect of both the metaphorical
frame (F =2.10; p=0.004) and the reasoning scenario (F =2.01; p<0.001), but no
(23,168) (46,336)
interaction effect (F =1.13; p=0.275). The main effect of the metaphorical frame is due to
(46,336)
the fact that participants’ generally attributed higher score for all response categories (except
for “Ambiguity”) when vaccination was described metaphorically rather than literally. The
main effect of the reasoning condition is due to the fact that participants’ generally attributed
higher scores for all response categories (except for “Ambiguity”), when the reasoning scenario
was uncertain rather than safe. The results of the multivariate analysis did not significantly
change when having age, education, personal opinion on vaccination, beliefs on the power of
great pharmaceutical companies or overall Covid-19 impact as covariates.

The ANOVA post hoc analysis revealed a significant difference between safe reasoning
and uncertain reasoning scenarios with rebutting defeaters for both the perceived meaning
ambiguity (t=3.83; p<0.001) and the individual/collective persuasion categories
(convincingness: t=-2.73; p=0.019 and t=-3.67; p<0.001; emotional impact: t=-3.05; p=0.007
and t=-3.28; p=0.003, respectively at individual and collective level). Rebutting reasoning
scenarios were indeed perceived as less ambiguous, more convincing, and emotionally
appealing than the safe reasoning situations, at both a personal and collective level. Only at the
collective level a significant difference was revealed between safe and uncertain reasoning
conditions (with rebutting defeaters) for both understandability (t=-2.49; p=0.036) and
commitment to vaccination (t=-3.03; p=0.008). For both response categories, participants
assigned higher value responses in the case of uncertain reasoning conditions with rebutting
defeaters when compared to safe reasoning conditions. On the contrary, a significant difference
was revealed between safe reasoning and uncertain reasoning with undercutting defeaters for
both the collective perceived safety (t=-2.74; p=0.018) and the collective uptake of experts’
advice (t=-2.74; p=0.018). For both response categories, participants assigned higher value
responses in the case of uncertain reasoning scenarios with undercutting defeaters when
compared to safe reasoning scenarios.
Neither a main metaphorical framing effect nor a main reasoning structure effect was
found on participants’ acceptance of the conclusion, personal and collective trust in institutions,
showed instead a significant interaction of the metaphorical frame with the reasoning structure
of the text on the personal feeling of safety (p=0.040), individual trust in expertise and uptake
of experts’ advice (respectively, p=0.036 and p=0.015), and collective trust in institution
(p=0.034). Post hoc analysis revealed that the interaction effect on the personal feeling of safety
was due to the significant difference between LS and MU conditions (p=0.005), and LU and
MU conditions (p=0.002) (Fig 1). As to what concerns the uptake of experts’ advice, the
interaction effect was due to a significant difference between LS and MU conditions (p=0.005),
and LS and LR conditions (p=0.028). As to what concerns collective trust in institutions, the
interaction effect was due to a significant difference between MS and MU conditions (p=0.045)
(Fig 2).

4. Discussion
Metaphor proves to be very useful to let laypeople understand a complex health issue in
the case of vaccination: when compared to literal descriptions of vaccination, the beehive
metaphor makes the message easier to understand. The results confirm previous literature as to
what concerns the general communicative potential of metaphor [61; 42]: independently of the
reasoning structure of the text, participants thought that the metaphorical description of
vaccination could be more persuasive not only for themselves, but also for the majority of
people, especially for what concerns the emotional impact. Metaphors can indeed have many
functions in both interpersonal and mass communication and be mediated by multiple
psychological mechanisms. First of all, metaphor activates information directly connected to
the communication topic, as it attributes some relevant properties of the source to the target. In
the process, it can favor the understanding of the communication topic, but also influence
people’s attitudes and emotive evaluation toward the communication topic [70; 14]. In the case
of vaccine communication, participants’ attitude and evaluations were indeed influenced by the
metaphorical description of vaccination as a collaborative endeavor, especially for what
concerned their perceived feeling of safety and control over the health situation at both a
personal and collective level. The first main hypothesis (H1) that extended metaphors, explicitly
intended to promote the vaccination uptake via a relevant property (“collaborative”) for the
argumentative text, elicit stronger communicative effects than its literal counterpart, is thereby
confirmed.
The results also confirmed the second main hypothesis (H2) that uncertain reasoning
scenarios are relevant for the comprehension of the text on vaccination. Not only the overall
understandability of the text was higher in uncertain reasoning scenarios when compared to
Preprint version submitted on December 30, 2020
safe reasoning scenarios, but also its convincingness at both an individual and collective level.
Texts based on an uncertain reasoning structure make explicit possible defeaters which are
instead not envisaged in safe scenarios. Making possible defeating conditions explicit, texts
based on uncertain reasoning structure allow a better grasp of how vaccination works, resulting
even clearer than texts based on a safe reasoning structure. Besides anticipating possible
defeaters, the texts based on uncertain reasoning scenarios propose a solution in the conclusion
at the collective level, thus enhancing also the collective feeling of perceived safety, and the
possible collective commitment and adherence to vaccination.
The persuasive effect of uncertain reasoning scenarios is significantly stronger than the
safe one in the case of rebutting defeaters. Texts based on uncertain scenarios via rebutting
defeaters are perceived not only as more understandable and leading to vaccination commitment
at a personal level, but also as more convincing and emotionally appealing than the safe
reasoning situations, at both a personal and collective level. These texts were indeed based on
the single story of the child, Aldo, “suffering from a serious pathology, who cannot get
vaccinated and cannot stay safe since people around him are not vaccinated”. Drawing on a
concrete and potentially “more dangerous” case when compared to both the other cases, the text
may be experienced also as more emotionally appealing and the communicative effect of the
text may be enhanced by a reasoning process that also exploits aspects of imaginative self-
identification and/or empathy to promote vaccination [53]. Especially when compared to texts
based on safe reasoning scenarios, the rebutting case is indeed highly visual (without having
the contraindications of a real picture, [40]) and easier to emotionally share [13]. Previous
literature also shows indeed that presenting factual descriptions are more successful
communication strategies for vaccination commitment than presenting undercutting literal
arguments against anti-vaccination myths [27; 24]. On the contrary, texts based on uncertain
situations via undercutting defeaters are thought to increase the feeling of safety and the uptake
of experts’ advice at a collective level when compared to texts based on safe reasoning
conditions. Differently from the reasoning conditions with rebutting defeaters, those with an
undercutting defeater instead present a general condition that could undermine the conclusion,
thus having stronger communicative effects at the collective level.
However, neither a main metaphorical framing effect nor a main defeasible reasoning
effect was found on participants’ acceptance of the conclusion, trust in institutions, and
reasoning (as instead was found by Thibodeau and Borodisky [66, 67]), but provides a more
nuanced set of communicative effects. While metaphor was found to influence participants’
Preprint version submitted on December 30, 2020
acceptance of the conclusion in the case of syllogisms in narrow contexts [17], this effect seems
lost in the case of wider contexts, where the persuasive effects of the text prevail over the
argument evaluation. Also, metaphor use is not a predictor of higher vaccination intentions, as
instead was found by Scherer and colleagues [54]. Presumably, just reading a text presenting a
metaphor for vaccination is unlikely to directly produce a change in vaccination intentions,
which are strongly linked to participants’ previous beliefs on vaccination. As already discussed,
the vaccination commitment and adherence depend on a more nuanced set of reasoning
conditions, being also different at a personal and collective level. The results also disconfirm a
main interaction between the metaphorical framing and the reasoning structure on the
acceptability of the text conclusion and the overall set of communicative effects. However, even
though the main effects of both the metaphorical frame and the defeasible reasoning on the
acceptability of the conclusion are overall independent, the results partially confirm H3,
showing a significant interaction effect in the case of the individual feeling of safety, trust in
expertise and uptake of experts’ advice, especially in the case of reasoning with undercutting
defeaters.
The interaction is given by the significant difference between the metaphorical
“undercutting” reasoning (MU) condition and the literal safe reasoning (LS) condition, as
participants attributed higher value response to the former than the latter. When compared to
the metaphorical safe reasoning (MS) condition, in (MU) condition participants attributed
higher value responses also to the collective trust in institutions. Metaphor description of
vaccination and defeasible reasoning support each other especially in (MU) condition, as the
metaphor was extended in the text via the relevant property (“collaborative”) underpinning a
more general connection to the conclusion. The undercutting defeater would be the more
relevant premise to invert the direction of the main inference to the conclusion, which is instead
granted by both the conclusion of the text and the extended metaphor. Metaphors can indeed
“influence the degree to which the recipient generates pro- or counter-arguments” [42, p. 787]
and, especially when extended, metaphor can support the inference and the direction of
elaboration of the argument where it appears. In this case, the metaphor —via its extended
property— directs attention toward the most relevant feature from an argumentative point of
view and supports the reasoning process, by activating an expectancy on the conclusion and
making the overall text coherent. In directing attention to the most relevant property for the
sake of argument, the metaphor can also have a corresponding directional effect on attitudes
toward the topic of communication. Indeed, from a communicative perspective, this interaction
between extended metaphor and reasoning with undercutting defeaters has the effect of making
Preprint version submitted on December 30, 2020
the interlocutor feel reassured by the expert and trust her expertise, possibly connected also to
the increased uptake of experts’ advice. The case of reasoning with rebutting defeaters is
somewhat different under this respect, as it is based on a concrete case where the metaphorical
relevant property is itself undermined (by the anti-vaccination collective behavior).
Previous studies supported the idea that metaphor can also influence people’s attitudes
and evaluation toward the communication source, thus affecting the credibility of the speaker
and favoring attitude change [9]. The communicator credibility view suggests that
communicators who use metaphors are judged more credible than ones who use literal language
[10, 48]. The reason is that novel metaphors may point out unexpected analogies, thus possibly
leading to creative thinking and/or revision of (previous) untenable beliefs. As the success of
health communication is intrinsically linked with patient trust [18; 71], metaphor use might turn
out to be essential not only to the proper comprehension of vaccination, but also to therapy
adherence [51]. However, previous studies provided mixed results on metaphor’s enhancement
of the source credibility [60, 48] and our study supports the idea that “well-used” metaphors in
specific reasoning scenarios rather than metaphors tout court facilitate persuasion. As argued
above, it is not the ability of highlighting relevant similarities between the beehive and
vaccination per se that automatically makes the extended metaphor a good reasoning strategy
for the overall argument. In the cases of vaccination we analyzed in this study, both a
communicative and reasoning competence seems to be required to boost trust and vaccination
commitment [71], which finally is at the core of the vaccine hesitancy problem [33; 59].
Previous studies on the deliberate use of scientific metaphors in academic discourse [2]
showed that there is an asymmetry in expertise between the expert and the addressee which
might entail a mismatch in the uptake of the metaphor. Of course, also the listener’s knowledge
of the target domain is relevant, as it influences the path of possible sound inferences on the
target issue. The mismatch might be simply due to the constitutive expert/laypeople asymmetry
in terms of domain knowledge, which might be overcome by appropriate
communicative/argumentative strategies [4]. However, pre-existing knowledge about the target
[49] or strong ideological views about the target [32] could make the metaphor unlikely to
change how people reason about the target domain, as well as their attitudes or behavior [42].
For instance, in the case of vaccination, Scherer and colleagues [54, p. 37] concluded that the
effects of the metaphorical frames “were found among individuals who occasionally receive flu
vaccinations but not among individuals who never or always receive flu vaccinations”. Further
research should be done on the influence of previous beliefs on individual differences in
vaccination behavior: a trustful relationship with experts and institutions needs to be achieved
Preprint version submitted on December 30, 2020
even more so to counter vaccine hesitancy, which is not confined to people refusing (or
encouraging others to refuse) vaccination [75].
5. Conclusions
The results of the study provided an overall picture of the communicative and reasoning
competences far more nuanced than expected in using metaphor to promote vaccination. The
study should be extended as it is limited for geographical area, and also presented in another
time-framework, when not (directly) influenced by the quite recent COVID-19 outbreak.
Further research should also consider conventional and non-extended metaphors as well as
emotive metaphors (i.e. metaphors having positive/negative valence) to compare the
metaphorical communicative effects, especially in terms of emotional impact and persuasion,
on vaccination uptake. Also, alternative reasoning scenarios should be considered, to further
understand the different role of rebutting vs. undercutting defeaters in reasoning about
vaccination.
Metaphor does not automatically increase vaccination commitment and trust. Not even
defeasible reasoning, as a specific competence of experts’, can do that. Rather, both a
communicative and defeasible reasoning competence is needed to enhance trust on
immunization, with possible different outcomes at an individual and collective level. As in other
fields of science communication in general and health communication in particular, metaphor
can be an opportunity for a good argument, constructing social bonding but also committing to
both the risks and responsibilities of communication [19]. Depending on the argumentative
structure and the kind of defeasible envisaged alternatives, metaphor can also present an
imagined scenario (with its possible features and consequences) we might or not adhere to [16],
influencing our uptake of the overall argument.
