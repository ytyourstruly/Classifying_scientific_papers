Running Title: Forgiveness in Children
Abstract:
Forgiveness is a powerful feature of human social life, allowing for the restoration of positive,
cooperative relationships. Despite its importance, we know relatively little about how forgiveness
develops in early life and the features that shape forgiveness decisions. Here, we investigate
forgiveness behavior in children between the ages of 5 and 10 (N = 257) from the United States, varying
transgressor intent and remorse in a behavioral task that pits punishment against forgiveness. We find
that baseline levels of forgiveness are high, suggesting children assume the best of transgressors in the
absence of information about intent and remorse. We also find age-related increases in sensitivity to
intent, but not remorse, such that older children are more likely to forgive accidental transgressions. As
forgiveness is an important tool in the human social toolkit, exploring the ways in which this ability
develops across age can help us better understand the early roots of human cooperation.

1. Introduction:
Cooperation is a key feature of human social life, underpinning the vast networks found across
human societies (Henrich et al., 2005). These cooperative interactions are not always harmonious,
however, as transgressions can and do occur. Consequently, social behaviors such as punishment and
forgiveness are crucial for the maintenance of cooperative relationships (Fehr & Gächter, 2000; Forster
et al., 2019). While much work has focused on punishment’s role in restoring cooperation (Raihani et al.,
2012), forgiveness — which has been broadly defined as a prosocial change toward a perceived
transgressor (Forster et al., 2019) — can also restore positive relationships, in sometimes lower-cost
ways. Indeed, when formally modeled, generous-tit-for-tat strategies that allow for the forgiveness of
transgressions can invade and outcompete standard tit-for-tat strategies (Godfray, 1992), suggesting
forgiveness can be a successful strategy in repeated interactions.
Advances in the adult literature have helped shape our understanding of the form and function
of forgiveness (Godfray, 1992; McCullough, 2008; Worthington Jr. et al., 2018) as a cognitive system for
resolving interpersonal conflict (McCullough et al., 2013). Functionally, forgiveness can be thought of as
a set of motivational changes whereby an individual becomes less disposed to retaliation and more
disposed to reconcile with the transgressor (McCullough et al., 1997). Additionally, our understanding
of the psychological mechanisms supporting forgiveness has been refined through experimental and
psychometric research with adults. For instance, work with adults suggests that decision-makers are
sensitive to social information, tending to forgive more in cases where the transgressor is remorseful
(Jeter & Brannon, 2018; Tabak et al., 2012) or where the transgression is deemed accidental (Wohl &
Reeder, 2004). Further, psychometric work has helped elucidate the underlying psychological structure
of forgiveness; in a recent study, Forster et al. (2019) found the best psychometric model of forgiveness
is a single attitudinal dimension ranging from malevolence to benevolence — an approach used to
develop the dependent variable in the current study.
Despite its importance to our social lives, we know surprisingly little about the emergence of
forgiveness in early life (van der Wal et al., 2017). Developmental work into this topic can help elucidate
the building blocks of this social ability and how they dissociate across ontogeny. A small but growing
body of literature suggests that children’s forgiveness becomes increasingly sophisticated with age
(Darby & Schlenker, 1982, 1989). When forming third-party judgments, there is evidence to suggest
that children are sensitive to relevant social cues when making forgiveness decisions. For instance, in
hypothetical vignettes, children report being more willing to forgive transgressions that are accidental
(Nobes et al., 2017; Ohbuchi & Sato, 1994) and low in severity (Goss, 2002). They are also more likely to
Running Title: Forgiveness in Children
report that they would forgive transgressors who are remorseful (Darby & Schlenker, 1982, 1989; Vaish
et al., 2011) and evaluate them more positively (Banerjee et al., 2010; Oostenbroek & Vaish, 2019b;
Smith et al., 2010). These judgments may, in part, be related to broader developments in theory-of-
mind ability. For instance, children who pass a false belief task deem it less acceptable to punish
accidental transgressions (Killen et al., 2011).
However, while the elicitation of vignette-based judgments is helpful for understanding how
children reason about forgiveness, it is unclear how these judgments translate to first-person decision-
making. This relationship between judgments and behavior is complicated by the knowledge-behavior
gap in children — the dissociation between an individual’s actual behavior and their judgments of
normative behavior (Blake et al., 2014). For instance, in other tasks measuring social behavior, while
children are aware of norms surrounding, say, fairness, they still choose to act selfishly and prefer not to
share (Kogut, 2012; Smith et al., 2013). Thus, it may be the case that a closer examination of children’s
actual behavior may provide novel insights, above and beyond their reported forgiveness-related
judgments. Consequently, of special interest are the few experimental studies that have examined
children’s forgiveness when they themselves are the targets of a transgression. These studies largely
suggest that children are sensitive to transgressor remorse. In a study with 4-to-7 year-old American
children, Smith and Harris (2012) find that when children are the victim of a transgression, they report
feeling better and judge the transgressor to be nicer when an apology is issued Further, in a study with
6 and 7-year-old American children, Drell and Jaswal (2016) find that children are more willing to share
resources — in this case, stickers — with a transgressor who offers an apology as opposed to one who
does not. And more recently, in a study with 4 and 5-year-old American children, Oostenbroek and
Vaish (2019a) find that children are more willing to reward a remorseful transgressor over an
unremorseful one — in this case, by gifting them a cloth flower.
While past work highlights a role for remorse in guiding children’s forgiveness, we are aware of
no prior work that directly tests children’s forgiveness as a result of a transgressor’s intentions, in cases
where participants themselves are the targets of a transgression. However, in research inspired by
Piaget (1932), Cushman and colleagues (2013) demonstrate that between the ages of four and eight,
American children increasingly make moral judgments on the basis of an actor’s intent, as opposed to
the outcome that the actor brings about. That is, they believe that accidental harms — bad outcomes
with benign intent — are less “naughty” and less punishable than attempted harms — benign outcomes
with bad intent. These results lead to the prediction that children will be more forgiving towards
accidental transgressors across development.
Running Title: Forgiveness in Children
The studies above suggest that children incorporate relevant social information into their
forgiveness behavior. However, we currently do not know whether children’s firsthand forgiveness
behavior is conditioned on whether a transgression is intentional or accidental, how information about
intent interfaces with remorse, or the extent to which children forgive in the absence of this
information, particularly in cases in which children themselves are victims of transgressions. Here, we
examine how information about transgressor intent and remorse influences children’s forgiveness
behaviors in a behavioral task that allows a continuous choice between punishment and forgiveness.
2. Methods:
2.1. Participants:
Our participants were 257 U.S. American children between the ages of 5 and 10 years old (M =
7.85, SD = 1.72, 125 girls). We chose this age range in hopes of achieving high rates of comprehension in
our task and to capture a period of life marked by increasing sophistication in children’s understanding
of moral responsibility, punishment, and distributive judgment (Shultz et al., 1986; Smith & Warneken,
2016). An additional 14 children were tested but excluded based on pre-specified criteria: parental
intervention in the study (n=1), failure to follow directions (n=1), parent asked to stop (n=1),
neurodevelopmental disorders (n=2), experimenter error (n=7), language comprehension issues (n=1),
and previous participation in the task (n=1). The target sample size was determined by an a priori power
analysis which, assuming a medium effect size (d = 0.4) and 80% power, suggested a minimum sample
size of 240 participants. In recruiting, we aimed for approximately 80 children in each of the three age
groups — 5-6 year olds, 7-8 year olds, and 9-10 year olds — with the rule that no single age within each
group should represent more than two-thirds of the participants therein. Our sample size exceeded the
minimum sample size slightly in order to finish a weekend of testing at a given site.
Participants were recruited from a large city in the New England region of the United States,
through institutional databases of interested families and in-person recruitment at local zoos,
museums, and parks. Across testing locations, condition assignment and children’s forgiveness
behaviors were similar and did not significantly differ (see Supplement for more details). We also find
no differences in age across conditions (see Supplement). The forgiveness task described below was
sometimes followed by additional tasks measuring other social preferences. However; in all cases, the
forgiveness task was first. Study methods were approved by the institutional review boards at the
affiliated institution and adhere to international standards for ethical human subjects research. For all
children, participation required written parental consent and children's verbal assent. Children older
Running Title: Forgiveness in Children
than seven also completed written assent forms. While individual demographic information was not
collected for this study, information collected from subsequent studies among these same locations,
similar times of year, and age groups breaks down to roughly 57% White, 13% Asian, 13% Other, 11%
Black or African American, and 6% Hispanic, withy 92% of parents holding a bachelor’s degree or
higher.
2.2. Procedure:
Across all conditions, the experimenter sat next to the participant and told them they would
have the chance to make some drawings. The experimenter then introduced a novel resource: a “magic
color scratch sheet”. The sheet was a small, square piece of paper with a layer of black, carbon film on it
that could be scratched off with a stylus, revealing rainbow colors underneath. The experimenter
demonstrated the resource by drawing a star on one sheet. The participant was given a short period of
time to practice drawing on the sheet. The experimenter then told the participant they would have a
chance to make five more drawings and proceeded to bring out and open a small box that ostensibly
held the additional sheets. However, upon opening the box, the experimenter “discovered” that the five
sheets had already been drawn on. Experimenters were instructed to feign surprise and
disappointment. The experimenter then said, “Oh no, it looks like someone before you already drew on
them and you won’t get to complete this activity. We don’t have any more of these.” While we did not
directly measure children’s own emotional reactions, previous work by Smith and Harris (2012) — using
a similar protocol where promised resources were not delivered due to another child’s actions —
suggest that children tend to be disappointed by this event.
Following this, the experimenter noticed and pulled out a note in the box which was allegedly
from another experimenter. Here, to manipulate intent and remorse information, children were
randomly assigned to one of five conditions in a 2x2 design with a baseline. The conditions were (1) a
Baseline (B) condition in which they were told “A kid that was here before drew on these scratch
sheets.”, (2) an Intentional / Remorse (IR) condition in which they were told “A kid that was here before
you knew these were for you, but they drew on them anyway, on purpose. They are really sorry that
they used the scratch sheets.”, (3) an Intentional / No Remorse (INR) condition with the same
information, except the “kid” is “not sorry that they used the scratch sheets,”(4) an Accidental /
Remorse (AR) condition, in which they were told “A kid that was here before you did not know these
were for you, and they drew on them, accidentally. They are really sorry that they used the scratch
sheets.”, and (5) an Accidental / No Remorse (ANR) condition with the same information, except the
Running Title: Forgiveness in Children
“kid” is “not sorry.” Following the exclusions outlined above, our final sample had n = 55 children in the
Baseline condition, n = 53 in Accidental / Remorse, n = 50 in Accidental / No Remorse, n = 50 in
Intentional / No Remorse and n = 49 children in the Intentional / Remorse condition.
Following the manipulation, the experimenter told the participant they had to decide what to
do with the sheets. They could throw as many of the sheets as they wanted away into a trash can, or
return as many of the sheets as they wanted to the child that drew them by placing them in an
envelope. Note that children could not keep the sheets for themselves. We considered the number of
sheets returned as a measure of forgiveness. The experimenter then asked the participant two
comprehension questions to assess whether they understood how to throw away or return the
drawings. Success rates for both comprehension questions were high — 90% and 96% of responses
were spontaneously correct on the first try, respectively. If a participant’s response was not
spontaneously correct, the experimenter repeated the correct information, then asked the
comprehension question again. This process was repeated once more. If the participant failed all three
attempts, the researcher read the correct information to the child and moved on. We did not exclude
on the basis of comprehension failures, in line with our a priori plan to not exclude such cases as children
immediately receive the correct information before proceeding, but note that failure rates after three
attempts on the two comprehension questions were quite low: 2% and 1%, respectively.
Following the comprehension questions, the experimenter turned around to give the
participant privacy. The participant was instructed to ring a bell when they were finished making their
decision. Afterwards, the experimenter posed two recall questions, asking the participant to remember
whether the transgression was intentional and whether the transgressor expressed remorse. Recall
questions were not asked in the baseline condition. Recall rates were fairly high: 78% of participants
accurately recalled whether the transgressor was intentional, and 90% of participants accurately
recalled whether the transgressor was remorseful. A generalized linear mixed model with subject-level
random effects suggests that the recall rate for remorse is indeed higher than for intent (OR = 3.31, 95%
CI [1.69, 6.45], z = 3.5, p < 0.001). The results reported below include all participants, regardless of recall
rate. However, to ensure that recall rates did not play a significant role in children’s behaviors, we ran
additional analyses (reported in the Supplement), and found that recall rates do not change the main
findings reported below. The experimenter then asked the participant to judge how bad the
transgressor’s actions were. Please see the Supplement for our full protocol and visualizations of
children’s judgments. To ensure participants had a positive experience in the task, all children received
prizes upon the study’s conclusion.
Running Title: Forgiveness in Children
For each participant, we recorded the number of sheets given back to the transgressor
(numeric, 0-5), the experimental condition (factor, five levels), and the age of the participant (numeric,
calculated from date of birth). For nine participants with incomplete date-of-birth information, exact
age was imputed as their reported age plus six months (e.g. if a parent reported their child’s age as 8,
their exact age was recorded as 8.5 years). Data were coded from worksheets by an independent coder,
and from videos of recorded sessions by a separate, independent coder. A comparison of video and
paper coding for recorded sessions (approximately 88% of the sample) revealed high consistency, with
a 93% match rate for the dependent variable of interest (number of sheets given back). In the small
percentage of cases with coding conflict, a research assistant reviewed the live coding worksheet and
video and reconciled the discrepancy, which was then reviewed again and approved by the senior
experimenter.
We used R version 4.0.0 for all analyses (R Core Team, 2020). A new variable for remorse was
dummy coded (1 = remorse, 0 = no remorse) across the experimental conditions, as was a new variable
for whether the transgression was accidental (1 = accidental, 0 = intentional). We ran a total of five
Poisson regressions to investigate the role of intent (numeric, dummy coded 0-1), remorse (numeric,
dummy coded 0-1), and condition (factor, five levels) on the number of sheets children chose to return
to the transgressor (numeric, 0-5). We also included exact age (numeric) to investigate developmental
trends and gender (factor, male or female) to allow comparison to previous work on gender differences
in prosocial behavior (Benenson et al., 2019).
3. Results
We find no main effects of condition or an interaction between condition (factor, five levels)
and age (numeric, continuous) on children’s forgiveness behavior (see Supplement). Interestingly, we
find that children return a sizable number of sheets to the transgressor in the baseline condition (M =
3.76, SD = 1.39), even in the absence of intent and remorse information. Indeed, across all conditions,
children gave back more sheets (M = 3.47, SD = 1.53) than predicted by chance, t(256) = 10.09, p <
0.0001. Looking just at the Baseline condition, we further do not find that children’s forgiveness
behavior changes with age (see Supplement for model output).
Participants’ judgments of the badness of the transgressor’s actions track these forgiveness
behaviors, as well. On a scale of 1 being “very, very good” to 6 being “very, very bad”, participants judge
transgressors in the baseline condition (M = 3.72, SD = 1.19) similarly to how they do in the Accidental /
Remorse condition (M = 3.88, SD = 1.04), suggesting that they do not assume the worst of
Running Title: Forgiveness in Children
transgressors in the absence of clear reasons to do so. Participants’ judgments of the badness of the
transgessor’s actions are significantly higher in the remaining three conditions: Intentional / Remorse
(M = 4.19, SD = 1.06), Accidental / No Remorse (M = 4.55, SD = 1.00), and Intentional / No Remorse (M =
4.72, SD = 1.11). This suggests intentional harms and lack of remorse are relevant to children’s attitudes,
as well as their behaviors (see Supplement for analysis). We also find a significant effect of age, such
that older children are less harsh in their evaluations of the transgressor (B = -0.13, SE = 0.04, p =
0.0009). We also find a relationship between judgments and number of sheets given back, such that the
more negative the judgment, the fewer number of sheets children return to the transgressor (B = -0.07,
SE = 0.03, p = 0.02).
To investigate the primary research question of the effects of intent and remorse on
forgiveness, we continued our analyses on the four experimental conditions, excluding the baseline. As
mentioned above, we dummy coded our conditions to distinguish between accidental and intentional
conditions, and between remorseful and unremorseful conditions. We built a total of five models to
to consider the main effects of the variables of interest, two models to investigate how intent and
remorse information interacts with age to influence forgiveness behaviors, one to investigate the two-
way interaction between intent and remorse, and another to consider the three-way interaction
between intent, remorse, and age. We do not find evidence for a two-way interaction between intent
and remorse [LRT, χ2, p = 0.63], nor a three-way interaction between age, intent, and remorse [LRT, χ2,
p = 0.77]. We find no interaction between age and remorse but do find evidence of an interaction
To further break down the interaction between age and intent, we conducted a simple slopes
analysis to compare how age predicts the number of sheets given back between intentional and
accidental conditions. Using the interactions package (Long, 2019), we find that there is no significant
effect of age on forgiveness behavior in cases of intentional harms (β = -0.02, SE = 0.03, p = 0.56), but
there is a significant effect of age on forgiveness behavior in cases of accidental harms (β = 0.08, SE =
0.03, p = 0.01). In other words, the interaction between age and intent is driven by children being more
forgiving of accidental harms as they get older.

4. Discussion:
Here, we examined how information about a transgressor’s intent and remorse influences
children’s forgiveness in a task that pits forgiveness against punishment. In a large sample of American
children, we find that in the absence of intent and remorse information, children are very forgiving,
suggesting that they are filling in the blanks of the transgression rather charitably. While other work
has found age-related increases in forgiveness across adolescence and adulthood (Cheng & Yim, 2008;
Girard & Mullet, 1997), we did not find overall age-related increases in forgiveness across childhood, but
do find that children’s judgments of the transgressor soften with age, such that older children are less
willing to say the transgressor’s actions were “very, very bad”. We further find targeted changes with
age based on specific information about the transgressor, such that the transgressor’s intent seems to
matter relatively more across age, as children become increasingly forgiving of accidental harms. These
results align with previous evidence suggesting older children view accidental harms as less punishable
(Cushman et al., 2013).
Children’s judgments of the transgressor’s actions provide another interesting window into the
emergence of forgiveness. We find that intentional harms and lack of remorse are judged more harshly,
and that those who judged the transgressor more harshly are also less willing to return sheets to them.
These results support the notion that children are reasoning about both remorse and intent in their
evaluations, and aligns with previous work suggesting children’s evaluations of others are often
internally consistent with their behaviors (Paulus et al., 2018).
Our findings raise important questions that are ripe for exploration in future work. First, as
previous work has suggested that theory-of-mind plays a role in shaping moral judgments of accidental
versus intentional harms (Killen et al., 2011), it’s possible that the age trends we observe are in part
explained by proficiency in mentalizing ability. Thus, future work should consider more explicitly how
theory-of-mind ability influences forgiveness decisions in similar contexts. Second, while we do not find
a strong effect of remorse on children’s forgiveness, this does not suggest that remorse plays no role,
but rather that it may be weighted less when intent information is also available.
There are methodological differences between this study and others that could account for the
limited role of remorse. For instance, in Oostenbroek & Vaish (2019), children made a choice regarding
which person to give a flower to: one who was remorseful or one who was not. This explicit contrast
may have made the presence of an apology more salient. However, our results also differ from studies
without these explicit contrasts; for instance, Drell and Jaswall (2016) find that children shared more
with a transgressor that verbally apologized. Thus, it may be that remorse in our study was also less
Running Title: Forgiveness in Children
salient than in other studies where participants could actually see or hear a transgressor apologizing.
While we find that children judge remorseful transgressors less harshly, this may not have been a
strong enough manipulation to lead to behavioral differences. Differences in our findings compared to
past work may also be due to variation in our measure, as our task involved a continuous decision
between throwing away resources or returning them while other tasks frequently involve behaviors
such as sharing or allocating resources across two characters. Our task also differed in that it asked
children to distribute resources that were supposed to be for them but used by another individual.
Further, our task involved first-person decisions, which may differ from past work examining third-
person judgments. Taken together, however, our results do converge with previous findings in the
literature suggesting that children’s forgiveness behaviors become increasingly sensitive to relevant
social cues, such as intent, across age. While apologies are generally thought to facilitate forgiveness,
some work with adults has found that apologies actually decrease forgiveness following intentional
harms (Struthers et al., 2008). This is not a pattern we observed in our age range. Further studies should
thus explore this possibility in older children.
Overall, our findings suggest early-emerging limits to children’s forgiveness of remorseful but
intentional transgressors; such limits may have implications for forgiveness in adulthood. Given recent
advances in our understanding of the psychological constructs (Forster et al., 2019) and neural
mechanisms (Fourie et al., 2020) underpinning forgiveness, behavioral tasks like ours, in which
recipients are the targets of transgressions and make a continuous choice between forgiveness and
punishment regarding a single individual, may better represent how these social decisions are typically
made in real settings. Given the importance of forgiveness in sustaining cooperative relationships,
exploring the ways in which this ability develops across age, and the features that influence these
behaviors, can help us better understand the early roots of human cooperation.

A. Additional Information
A1. Additional Participant Information
An additional 14 children were tested but excluded based on pre-specified criteria: parental
intervention in the study (n=1), failure to follow directions (n=1), parent asked to stop (n=1),
neurodevelopmental disorders (n=2), experimenter error (n=7), language comprehension issues (n=1),
and previous participation in the task (n=1).
For nine participants with incomplete date-of-birth information, exact age was imputed as their
reported age plus six months (e.g. if a parent reported their child’s age as 8, their exact age was
recorded as 8.5 years).
While individual demographic information was not collected for this study, information collected from
subsequent studies by our team among these same locations, similar times of year, and age groups
breaks down to roughly 57% White, 13% Asian, 13% Other, 11% Black or African American, and 6%
Hispanic, withy 92% of parents holding a bachelor’s degree or higher.
A2. Additional Coding Information
All sessions in which parents provided consent for video recording (approximately 88% of our sample)
were coded from both video and paper independently. Following exclusions, all of these participants
were all included in the reliability analyses. A comparison of video and paper coding revealed high
consistency, with a 93% match rate for the dependent variable of interest (number of sheets given
back). In the small percentage of cases with coding conflict, a research assistant reviewed the live
coding worksheet and video and then reconciled the discrepancy, which was then reviewed again and
approved by the senior experimenter.
A3. Additional Information about Comprehension Questions
If a participant’s response was not spontaneously correct, the experimenter repeated the correct
information, then asked the comprehension question again. This process was repeated once more. If
Running Title: Forgiveness in Children
the participant failed at all three attempts, the researcher read the correct information to the child and
moved on. We did not exclude on the basis of comprehension failures, in line with our a priori plan to
not exclude such cases as children immediately receive the correct information before proceeding, but
note that failure rates after three attempts on the two comprehension questions were quite low: 2%
and 1%, respectively.
B. Location Information
Participants were recruited and tested across six locations: in-lab on the Boston College campus,
Artesani Park, the Boston Commons, the Boston Children’s Museum, the Boston Zoo, and at the

C. Additional Analyses
C1. Behavior Across Locations
We also do not find evidence for a significant effect of location on participants’ behavior. We compared
the final three models reported in the manuscript with identical models that also had location as a
covariate. Model comparisons using Chi-square revealed no significant differences (all ps> 0.7).
C2. Age Across Conditions
An ANOVA revealed no significant differences in age across conditions [F(4, 252) = 0.35,p = 0.84].
C3. Condition Differences in Forgiveness Behavior
We find no main effects of condition and no evidence of an interactive effect of age and condition on

C4. No Effect of Recall on Forgiveness Behavior
As a robustness check, we considered whether a participant’s ability to accurately recall intent and
remorse information influenced their forgiveness behavior. We built a new index variable to measure
recall rate. Participants received a 1 for each recall question they were able to accurately answer. The
majority of participants were able to recall both intent and remorse information (72%, N = 141) and
received a score of 2. A smaller portion of participants (24%, N = 47) were able to accurately recall either
remorse or intent information, and a smaller portion still (4%, N = 7) were unable to recall either.
We then incorporated this new variable into the three primary models reported in the main text. The

remember and cases where they give the wrong information. The way the variable was tracked by the

D. Participants’ Judgments of the Transgressor’s Actions
Following the decision, participants were then asked to judge the actions of the transgressor, first
deciding if it was “okay or not okay” that the kid before them used their scratch sheets. Conditional
upon this answer, the experimenter then followed up with a severity question. If the participant
deemed the transgression as “not okay”, the experimenter would ask; “Was it a little bad that they used
your scratch sheets, pretty bad that they used your scratch sheets, or very, very bad that they used your
scratch sheets?” If the participant deemed the transgression as “ okay”, the experimenter would ask;
“Was it a little good that they used your scratch sheets, pretty good that they used your scratch sheets,
or very, very good that they used your scratch sheets?”
To assess how participants’ judgments varied across conditions, we first coded their responses from 1
of the badness of the transgressor’s actions across conditions. In the Baseline and Accidental / Remorse
conditions, participants judge the transgressor’s actions more positively than in the other three
transgressors actions and the number of sheets they returned to the transgressor.

“Hi, my name is [insert experimenter name]. What is your name? And how old are you? [Record]. I have a
few games today, and in these games, you’ll get the chance to take home some candy.”
“But before we get started, I want to make sure that you know: you don’t have to play these games if
you don’t want to. If you want to stop at any point, that’s okay, you just let me know and we’ll stop.
You’ll still get some candy.”
“Do you want to play this game?” [Wait for assent]
“Here is a paper bag. I’ll write your name on it. [Write name on bag]. Whatever candy you get in these
games will go in this bag for you to take with you. I will give it to you at the very end.”
“In this activity, you will get to make five rainbow scratch paper drawings! I will show you how it works
using this tester.” [Pull out tester strip.] “I can make a drawing by scratching on the sheet. Wherever I
scratch, colors appear. [Draw a BIG star on the sheet to show how it works]. Isn’t that cool?”
“Now you try.” [Give child thirty seconds to draw on the sheet].
“Awesome! I’ll put this in your bag for you to take home”. [Put sheets into bag]
“Now I’m going to get five sheets for you to make drawings with!!” [Open box, pull out 5 completed
drawing sheets.]

(I/R) INTENTIONAL / REMORSE: “A kid that was here before you knew these were for you, but
they drew on them anyway, on purpose. They are really sorry that they used the scratch
sheets.”
(I/NR) INTENTIONAL / NO REMORSE: “A kid that was here before you knew these were for
you, but they drew on them anyway, on purpose. They are not sorry that they used the scratch
sheets.”
(A) ACCIDENTAL / REMORSE: “A kid that was here before you did not know these were for
you, and they drew on them, accidentally. They are really sorry that they used the scratch
sheets.”
(R) ACCIDENTAL / NO REMORSE: “A kid that was here before you did not know these were for
you, and they drew on them, accidentally. They are not sorry that they used the scratch
sheets.”
(B) BASELINE: “A kid that was here before drew on these scratch sheets.”
“I know this is disappointing, but now it’s up to you to decide what to do with the drawings. You have
two choices. You can give as many as you want to the other kid who used them, or you can throw as
many as you want away.”
“Any drawings you want to give to them, you will put in this envelope [point to envelope]. Any drawings
you want to throw away, you will throw into this trash can [point to trash can].”
