Abstract: This paper clarifies the connotations and concepts of positive psychology. By
probing into the psychological factors of firefighting command cadets and the status quo
of moral education in firefighting command schools, this paper proposes that we should
apply the philosophy of positive psychology to guide our practice of moral education in
the new era. Moreover, it discusses the ways to give full play to the function of moral
education in the new teaching mode.
Keywords: positive psychology; firefighting command schools; moral education; new

I. Connotations and concepts of positive psychology
Positive psychology is a new field of research emerging in the United States,
mainly utilizing the more perfect experimental methods and measurement means of
current psychology, abandoning the negative and pessimistic research line and mode
of traditional psychology, and reinterpreting psychology with the starting point of
arousing the positive qualities of human beings. Positive psychology for the first time
as an empirical study of human optimism, happiness, curiosity, mental flexibility,
altruism, wisdom and the courage to create, and that contemporary psychology is in a
new historical transition, psychologists play an extremely important role, shouldering
a new mission.
Positive psychology believes that psychology is not only a science concerned
with disease or health, but also a science that emphasizes human happiness, pleasure,
satisfaction and development, and its mission is to promote the development of
individuals and society, and to help and guide people to try to improve and develop
themselves with a positive, open, optimistic, and enterprising mindset to achieve
happiness and well-being. From the research field of positive psychology, it mainly
includes three levels: first, on the subjective level, it advocates starting from
"positive", focusing on the positive power and potential of human beings, studying
the positive subjective experience, and helping individuals to find the positive
qualities such as inner strength, goodness, and virtue, with the emphasis on
emphasizing that human beings should deal with the past satisfactorily, feel the
present happily, and be full of joy and happiness.
Secondly, at the individual level, the study of positive personal traits, including
the ability to love, the ability to work, the ability to interact with others, the ability to
focus on the future, insight, talent and wisdom, etc.; thirdly, at the group level, the
study of positive organizational systems, including a stable society, a good
community, a healthy family, an effective school, and responsible media. Thirdly, at
the group level, it studies positive organizational systems, including stable societies,
good communities, healthy families, effective schools and responsible media.
Obviously, positive psychology focuses on the study of the positive aspects of human
nature, including the strengths and weaknesses of human beings.
It adopts a more scientific approach to studying and exploring human potential
and creativity, stimulating human vitality, helping people to build up their
self-confidence, and actively seeking and mastering ways and means of living a
happy life.
II. Important insights and implications of positive psychology
Positive psychology requires psychologists to look at human potential,
motivation and ability with a more open and appreciative eye, and to regard it as
their historical mission to promote the healthy growth of human beings, to stimulate
and cultivate their positive emotions, and to guide them towards happiness,
well-being and success. As a fire-fighting force, it shoulders the mission of rescue
and relief, and makes people live happily, and is an important defense force for
building a moderately prosperous society in the era of peace. And the fire academy
not only directly bear the responsibility of cultivating excellent physical and
intellectual quality of fire officers and soldiers, but also with the development of the
times to cultivate a positive and healthy mentality of high-level firefighting talent
mission. However, for a long time, due to the ideological and political work of
military colleges and universities focusing on the education of students' ideological
and moral quality, neglecting the cultivation of personality and psychological quality
of education targets, and lacking specific practical guidance on life and attention to
the feelings of education targets, the result is often that some students can not be well
integrated into the society and adapted to the society.
This calls for the need to reform the traditional ideological and political
education in fire fighting colleges and universities, on the one hand, to actively
expand the content, methods and means of education, on the other hand, to
reasonably absorb the ideological viewpoints of positive psychology, and to establish
a new fire fighting personnel training goals and value concepts.
(i) Positive psychology can provide ideological and political education in fire
The rise of positive psychology research reflects a shift in the current value
orientation of society as a whole, i.e., a shift away from negative, perverted
psychological research to the study of positive qualities. Ideological and political
education should also conform to the development of this era. At present, the
ideological and political education in fire fighting colleges and universities mainly
focuses on the ideological and moral quality of the education targets, ignores the
cultivation of personality and psychological quality of the education targets, only
emphasizes on the theoretical indoctrination and the solution of specific problems,
ignores the development of the potential of the education targets, the cultivation of the
psychological quality and the guidance of the value orientation, and pays attention to
the concern for their own feelings.
With the wave of globalization, the information society and the complexity and
specificity of the fire fighting work, the existing students are faced with different
ideological impact and psychological pressure, these impacts and pressures on the
ideological and political work of the fire fighting colleges and universities have put
forward new requirements, ideological and political work, if you do not change the
original way of work, broaden the horizons, it will be difficult to adapt to the
development of the times, and the value orientation of positive psychology can not
only be apt to solve specific problems, but also to develop the potential of the
education object and psychological quality training and value orientation leadership,
as well as attention to their own feelings.
The value orientation of positive psychology can not only guide the return of the
ideological and political education goal of the fire academy and balance the education
goal, but also reflect the student-oriented, pay attention to the potential of all the
students, cultivate a positive sense of belonging and sense of responsibility, and
promote the continuous growth, development and improvement of the students' mind.
(ii) Positive psychology can enrich and develop the content of ideological and
political education in fire academies
Ideological and political education advocates educating people, and positive
psychology advocates educating the mind and improving people's psychological
quality. For quite a long time, the traditional psychology is more focused on the study
of people's negative emotions and negative behaviors, ignoring the positive qualities
of people's excavation and research, only from the "problem" to remove the existence
of a variety of negative factors for the purpose of positive psychology from the
"positive" to start, focusing on the positive power and positive potential, mainly to
study people's optimism, optimism, positive potential, and the main study of people's
psychological quality.
Positive psychology advocates starting from "positive", focusing on people's
positive strength and positive potential, mainly studying people's optimism, happiness,
curiosity, mental flexibility, altruism, wisdom and courage to create, advocating an
open and appreciative view of everyone, through the cultivation or expansion of
people's inherent positive strength and positive qualities to make people really
become healthy and live a happy life, which is fully in line with the needs of the
development of individuals. This is fully in line with the needs of individual
development.
At present, the ideological and political education of the students in fire fighting
colleges and universities is basically based on the traditional way and strategy which
is mainly based on blocking, and the working mode is rigid and the sense of
innovation is not strong, while the research of positive psychology on the three levels
of positive emotion, positive personality and positive organization is not only in line
with the needs of the students' self-development, but also conducive to the expansion
of the ideological and political education style, methods and paths, and to the
enrichment and development of the content of ideological and political education,
which can effectively promote and strengthen the ideological and political education.
It also helps to expand the style, method and path of ideological and political
education, enrich and develop the content of ideological and political education, and
effectively promote and enhance the function of ideological and political education in
fire fighting institutions.
(c) Positive psychology can energize ideological and political educators in fire
academies
The word "positive" is of Latin origin and originally meant "actual" or
"potential". Therefore, in its original meaning, it includes both the internal and
external positive aspects of a person. Research in positive psychology confirms that
compared to the average person, those with a positive outlook have better social
adaptability and better social and moral qualities; they can face adversity, stress and
loss with greater ease, and are able to cope with unexpected social problems and
circumstances with ease. Positive mindedness advocates that problems should be
interpreted positively and that individuals should derive positive meaning from them.
While traditional ideological and political education focuses more on uncovering
weaknesses in human nature and correcting the bad habits of thought and behavior
of students, positive psychology advocates the ability to see the virtues and strengths
in people themselves, to establish a positive view of human nature and values, to
develop positive emotions, and to make the promotion of well-being and the
inculcation of hope the goal.
Therefore, with this aim in mind, ideological and political educators need to
adjust their working methods, focusing on shaping and cultivating the positive
qualities of all students, guiding them to care for themselves, others, and life,
learning to positively accept themselves, others, and society, positively approaching
social issues and positively engaging in social life, and experiencing happiness. In
this sense, positive psychology to guide the ideological and political education of
fire fighting colleges can not only inject positive power, but also greatly improve the
effectiveness of their mental health education.
III. Constructing a new model of ideological and political education in fire fighting
colleges and universities with the concept of positive psychology
(i) Building a positive external environment for ideological and political education
The development of an individual is influenced both by his or her personality
traits and by the environment in which he or she lives. In the idea of positive
psychology, the positive experience and the formation of positive mental qualities of
an individual are also considered to be influenced by positive environmental
conditions. Positive environment refers to the external environmental factors such as
family, school, community, classroom, mass media, etc. that influence the formation
of individual positive qualities and the realization of their potential. Psychological
research has found that reasonable social norms can promote the formation of a sense
of social responsibility.
People are more likely to develop positive and healthy psychological qualities
under the influence of a positive environment. Therefore, as the ideological and
political education of fire fighting colleges and universities, we should actively build
a good external environment for ideological and political education by strengthening
the construction of campus culture, vigorously organizing and carrying out all kinds
of healthy and beneficial campus cultural activities, and widely carrying out cultural
activities with ideological, cultural, recreational, academic, scientific and
technological as the basic content with the goal of high quality, high quality and high
efficiency, so as to form a good cultural atmosphere, and in particular, highlighting
the cultural characteristics of the school for the cadets.
Cadets to carry out rich school culture characteristics of the school style, school
motto for the content and form of fire campus spirit education, through colorful
campus cultural activities, to promote the healthy development of cadet personality
diversity, and activities as a carrier, in the development of civilization in many forms
of collective creation, cultivate cadets noble sentiments, enhance their positive
emotions, and then cultivate a positive quality of thought and moral qualities, and all
of these, can not be separated from a positive, healthy, harmonious and harmonious
environment, and all of these, can not be separated from a positive, healthy, and
harmonious environment. All these are inseparable from the fundamental role of
positive, healthy and harmonious campus culture construction.
(b) Training modern ideological and political educators with a new concept of
educating people
Ideological and political educators bear the responsibility and mission of
educating people, and the formation of trainees' ideological and moral qualities as
well as their worldview, outlook on life and values are inseparable from the quality
of ideological and political educators. A team of ideological and political educators
with a reasonable structure, excellent quality and strong sense of responsibility, and
with a new modern concept of educating people, is essential for the improvement of
the quality of students' ideological and moral character and the formation of their
worldview, life outlook and values positive psychology plays an important role in
influencing and guiding students to develop a high level of consciousness and a
correct value orientation.
Positive psychology to study the advantages and values of people as the goal,
good at capturing and mining students' own strengths and advantages in the
education process, and help to develop students' potential. Here, to actively
introduce and use the concept of positive psychology to build a new model of
ideological and political education in fire fighting colleges and universities.
One of the very important nodes is that we must cultivate a new and modern
concept of parenting into the ideological and political education workers
consciously cultivate a good teacher-student relationship, and maintain full
enthusiasm for the work, so that through the infectious effect of words and example,
the students' cognition, emotion, behavior, so that the students not only hear from
the teacher, but also from the teachers, the students' emotions and behavior, so that
the students will not only hear from the teachers, but also from the teachers, the
students' emotions.
So that the students not only from the teacher to listen to the guidance of
ideological education, but also from its positive and healthy attitude towards life
and the art of dealing with things, consciously cultivate an optimistic attitude
towards life, the courage to go beyond the self-confidence, sense of efficacy, and a
good IQ and EQ, and effectively enhance the flexibility of psychological maturity,
enhance the sense of satisfaction and fulfillment of the learning to face and deal
with various real-life contradictions and conflicts with positive and courageous
spirit of enterprise, and to enhance the psychological maturity of the students. They
can face and deal with various real-life conflicts and contradictions with a positive
and courageous enterprising spirit, and gradually refine the maturity of ideological
and political qualities in the practice of psychological maturity.
(c) Giving full play to the subjective role of trainees
The subjectivity of students refers to the behavioral characteristics of individual
functioning in educational activities, as the main body of students in the teacher's
guidance to deal with external relations, which is specifically expressed in the
selectivity, autonomy, mobility and creativity. In the view of positive psychology,
positive psychological factors are the driving force for survival and development of
human beings.
People are born with a large number of "positive genes", in the process of
personal socialization, people's inherent, positive genes determined by the
psychological elements can be activated to become a positive psychological factors
that determine human behavior, and then can be developed into a positive
psychological characteristics and psychological qualities. This tells us that ideological
and political education in fire fighting colleges and universities should establish the
awareness that students are the main subjects of educational activities and pay
attention to giving full play to their subjective role.
This is relative to the traditional kind of students only as the object of education
and always in a passive and obedient position of ideological and political education,
the fundamental difference is that the starting point and foothold of the two are
different, the latter ignores the interests and requirements of the individual educated
people, ignoring their subject position. Positive psychology, however, advocates the
construction of positive personality and encourages people to actively search for
their own and others' virtues and strengths, learn to use their own virtues and
strengths to live positively, get the experience of success, the joy of growth and
sense of value, and learn to use their own strengths and virtues to build self-esteem
and self-confidence in personality.
Therefore, it is crucial to scientifically use the theory of positive psychology to
stimulate students' motivation for self-learning and guide them to realize
self-improvement, self-development and self-improvement through self-education,
self-management, self-identification and self-enlightenment. It is the key to motivate
students to move from self-discovery to self-education, self-awareness, and to
enhance their sense of self-efficacy and control over the environment by their own
creativity, and to actively care for life, create life, and experience life.
