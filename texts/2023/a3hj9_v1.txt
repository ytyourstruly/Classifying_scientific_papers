1 Abstract
2 While force-feedback devices have been developed in areas such as virtual reality, there have been very few
3 comparative cognitive studies in nonhuman animals using these devices. In addition, although cross-modal perception
4 between vision and touch has been actively studied in nonhuman primates for several decades, there have been no
5 studies of their active haptic perception. In this study, we attempted to train force discrimination in chimpanzees
6 using a force-feedback device modified from a trackball. Chimpanzees were given different levels of force feedback
7 (8.0 N vs. 0.5 N) when moving the on-screen cursor to the target area by manipulating the trackball and were required
8 to select one of two choice stimuli based on the force cue. The experiment was conducted using a trial-block
9 procedure in which the same force stimulus was presented for a fixed number of trials, and the force stimulus was
10 changed between blocks. The block size was progressively reduced from 10 trials. Four chimpanzees were trained,
11 but none reached the learning criterion (80% or more correct responses under the condition that the force stimuli were
12 presented randomly). However, a detailed analysis of the chimpanzees' performance before and after the trial-block
13 switching revealed that their choice behavior could not be explained by a simple win-stay/lose-shift strategy,
14 suggesting that the switching of the force stimuli affected the chimpanzees' choice behavior. It was also found that the
15 chimpanzees performed better when switching from small to large force stimuli than when switching from large to
16 small force stimuli. Although none of the chimpanzees in this study acquired force discrimination, future studies
17 using such force feedback devices will provide new insights for understanding haptic cognition in nonhuman
18 primates from a comparative cognitive perspective.
19 Primates, including humans, use not only vision and sound to explore their environment but also other
20 sensory modalities, such as olfaction and touch. Compared to studies of visual and auditory perception, behavioral or
21 comparative cognitive research on touch has not been as intensively studied as in the neurophysiological domain
22 (Burton & Sinclair, 2000; Iwamura et al., 1985, 2002; O'Doherty et al., 2011; Sinclair & Burton, 1991a,b, 1993).
23 Interestingly, cross-modal perception in nonhuman primates was intensively studied about 50 years ago (Davenport,
24 1977; Ettlinger & Wilson, 1990), and there have been many studies of tactile-visual matching and transfer in this
25 context. For example, Cowey and Weiskranz (1975) showed that rhesus macaques that were able to discriminate
26 between edible and inedible stimuli using tactile information in the dark were also able to discriminate the shapes of
27 these stimuli using vision in a light environment. Davenport and Rogers (1970) also showed that chimpanzees and
28 orangutans could match a correct stimulus among alternatives of tactile stimuli to a sample stimulus of visual shape.
29 Jarvis and Ettlinger (1977) reported that shape discrimination of visual or tactile stimuli transferred to the other
30 modality in chimpanzees and rhesus macaques.
31 Among the few comparative cognitive studies, Hanus and Call (2011) recently focused on choice behavior
32 using weight as a cue. They presented chimpanzees with five opaque bottles, only one of which contained juice and
33 was heavier than the others, and examined the order in which the chimpanzees opened the bottles. The results showed
34 that they opened the heavier bottle significantly earlier. In another study, Schrauf et al. (2012) examined the nut-
35 cracking behavior of chimpanzees by presenting them with objects of the same shape but different weights and found
36 that they used the heaviest object, which could crack nuts most effectively, as a hammer. In these cross-modal
37 perception and weight discrimination studies, participants obtain tactile information by touching, grasping, and lifting
38 the stimuli themselves. This is done actively, rather than being presented with the stimuli passively, and is known as
39 "active touch" (Gibson, 1962). Active touch has also been studied in the neurophysiology of macaques (Sinclair &
40 Burton, 1991a,b, 1993).
41 Tactual perception can be defined as the perception based on two distinct senses, namely, the sense caused
42 by cutaneous stimulation and the kinesthetic sense (Loomis & Lederman, 1986). The cutaneous senses are the
43 sensations perceived through the skin, such as touch, pressure, temperature, and pain. These sensations are detected
44 by specialized receptors located in the skin and underlying tissues. The kinesthetic sense refers to the body's ability to
45 sense its position, movement, and orientation in space without relying on external cues detected by proprioceptors,
46 specialized sensory receptors located in muscles, tendons, and joints. Each of these sensations results in tactile
47 perception and kinesthetic perception, respectively, but in our daily lives, we perceive objects and events in an
48 integrated way with these two senses. For instance, through cutaneous and kinesthetic senses, we can perceive the
49 material of objects, surface roughness, compliance, friction, and more. Such tactual perception is referred to as haptic
50 perception (Kappers & Bergmann Tiest, 2013; Lederman & Klatzky, 2009; Loomis & Lederman, 1986).
51 In recent years, haptic perception has been actively studied in areas such as virtual reality, and devices for
52 force feedback have been intensively developed (Burdea et al., 1996) and are being put into practical use (e.g., Kern
53 et al., 2023).
54 However, the majority of behavioral studies using such devices have primarily involved humans evaluating
55 the performance of these devices (Robles-De-La-Torre & Hayward, 2001; Tanaka et al., 2017; Ly et al., 2021).
56 Neurophysiological studies have also become popular in recent years (e.g., Lin et al., 2012; Turner et al., 2013), but
57 their use in basic behavioral research has been very limited, especially in comparative cognitive research with
58 nonhuman primates.
59 In this study, we modified a trackball that had been previously used in comparative cognitive studies with
60 chimpanzees (Kaneko & Tomonaga, 2011, 2012, 2014; Kaneko et al., 2013; Ueda et al., 2012) into a force-feedback
61 device and conducted friction force discrimination training with chimpanzees (Figures 1 and 2). The standard trackball
62 serves as a pointing device to move a cursor on a monitor screen. As the ball rotates, it also rotates two orthogonal
63 roller shafts supporting the ball at the bottom, providing the computer with information about the distance traveled and
64 coordinates. We connected servomotors to these shafts to deliver force feedback. Using this modified trackball device,
65 we presented two different magnitudes of friction force and trained chimpanzees to perform a conditioned position
66 discrimination task.
71 Methods
72 Participants
74 had experienced various computer-controlled perceptual and cognitive experiments (Ludwig et al., 2011; Martinez &
75 Matsuzawa, 2009a; Matsuzawa et al., 2006; Tomonaga, 2001, 2010; Tomonaga et al., 2003), especially the tasks using
76 the trackball device (Kaneko & Tomonaga, 2011, 2012, 2014; Kaneko et al., 2013; Ueda et al., 2012). They lived in a
77 social group of 14 individuals in an indoor and environmentally enriched outdoor compound (770 m2) at the Primate
78 Research Institute, Kyoto University (Matsuzawa, 2006). No deprivation of food and water was conducted in the
79 present study.

97 Apparatus and experimental setting
98 This study was conducted in a booth (1.8 x 2.15 x 1.75 m) in a laboratory adjacent to the chimpanzee facility.
99 Each chimpanzee voluntarily came to the booth through the overhead pathway connecting the facility to the booth with
100 acrylic panels. A 21.5-inch LCD monitor (1pixel = 0.248mm) was set outside the booth, and a 12-cm diameter trackball
102 was modified to make force feedback possible (see later). The viewing distance was approximately 40 cm. Universal
103 feeders (Biomedica BUF-310) outside the booth supplied food rewards (small pieces of apple). The computers

115 measured the ball rotation information.
116 We used an impedance-based discrete-time friction model (Kikuuwe et al., 2006) to represent friction force.
117 In this model, we input measured position values, and it calculates the forces acting on the actuators. This model is
118 well-suited for lightweight, low-power force display devices that lack force sensors, such as trackballs or joysticks.
119 When the trackball is rotated with force feedback enabled, we can feel friction. However, initiating the
120 trackball rotation required a certain amount of force, and we observed that this force varied depending on the direction
121 of rotation. To address this issue, we adjusted the initial load of the motor, resulting in the elimination of the
127 Procedure
128 Preliminary training
129 The chimpanzee participants in the present experiment had enough experience using a trackball in the past,
130 so they did not need any preliminary training to use the trackball. They were, however, initially trained to move the
131 cursor to a circular area, which is necessary for the main discrimination task.
132 The cursor was presented on the left side of the screen, and the chimpanzees had to move a red dot-shaped
133 cursor (50 pixels in diameter) to a red circle (140 pixels in diameter). The red circle was then presented at a random
134 location in the gray area, and when the cursor was moved to that location, the red circle disappeared, and a new red
135 circle was presented at a different location. A food reward was provided if the chimpanzees moved the cursor within
136 the red circle twice. Each session consisted of 80 trials, and the chimpanzees received one session per day, five days
137 per week, under different force conditions. This preliminary training lasted for approximately one month.
139 Conditional position discrimination based on friction force
140 After completing the preliminary training, the chimpanzees were shifted to the discrimination task. In this
141 study, a conditional position discrimination task was used for force discrimination. In this task, participants had to
143 a schematic diagram of the task (see also Supplemental Video). First, a red dot-shaped cursor was presented at a random
144 position on the left side of the screen. At the same time, a red circle was presented at the center of the right side relative
145 to the cursor. When the chimpanzees moved the cursor into this circle (no force feedback at this time, i.e., 1.0 N), the
146 circle disappeared, and a gray field (1080 x 870 pixels) was presented. When the cursor was moved within this area,
147 force feedback was provided. At the right edge of this area, a red circle was again presented, and the chimpanzees had
148 to move the cursor toward it. Once the cursor was moved into the circle, the gray area and the red circle disappeared
149 (but the cursor remained on), and different shapes (choice stimuli) were presented above and below. A green star-shaped
150 stimulus was always presented at the top and a blue square at the bottom (100 x 100 pixels in size for each). When the
151 chimpanzees moved the cursor to the correct side in response to the force stimulus presented in the gray area, a chime
152 sounded, and a food reward was presented through the feeder. On the other hand, a buzzer sounded if they chose the
153 wrong side, which did not correspond to the force stimulus. We also introduced a correction procedure: if the
154 chimpanzees made an error, the same trial was repeated until they made the correct choice.
155 In this experiment, two different friction forces were presented. The forces were set to 8.0 N and 0.5 N,
156 respectively. We achieved a 0.5 N force "lighter" than 1.0 N by assisting the rotation of the ball with the servomotors.
157 The green star-shaped stimulus presented at the top corresponded to 8.0N, and the blue square stimulus presented at
158 the bottom corresponded to 0.5N.
160 Trial-block training
161 The present task is a type of cross-modal task in that the visual choice stimuli are matched to the force stimuli.
162 As mentioned in the introduction, it has been reported that chimpanzees are capable of haptic-visual cross-modal
163 matching, but in general, cross-modal tasks are known to be very difficult for them (Hashiya & Kojima, 1997,2001;
164 Martinez & Matsuzawa, 2009a,b). Therefore, we designed a step-by-step training procedure because this task is also
165 likely to be difficult to acquire.
166 For this purpose, we introduced trial-block training, in which the same stimulus is repeated for a certain
167 number of trials before switching to another stimulus (cf. Fujita, 1982; Tomonaga, 1990; Tomonaga et al., 1991;
168 Tomonaga & Ohta, 1990). Since the stimuli are the same within a trial block, this training facilitates the prevention of
169 repeated incorrect choices, making it easier to keep participants motivated and reducing inappropriate behavior.
170 Although the rate of correct choices when switching between blocks is often used as a measure of learning, the first
171 goal of this experiment was to stabilize the rate of correct choices within a block. We started with relatively large block
172 size and then gradually decreased the size, finally reaching a condition in which block sizes 3 and 2 appeared randomly
174 When performance stabilized in the 3/2 condition, we planned to move to a condition in which two types of stimuli
175 appeared randomly.
176 In this experiment, we did not conduct a pilot experiment to properly set parameters such as block size and
177 block size transition criteria. As a result, the block size transition schedule varied from individual to individual, as
179 learning criterion to achieve at least 85% correct trials for two consecutive sessions in the final random condition.
180 The number of trials per session varied from 22 to 40, depending on the block size. The number of blocks
181 within a session also varied from four to six. Experiments were conducted from one to four sessions per day for a
182 maximum of five days per week.

198 first block were not included in the calculation of these values. The number of sessions for each block per individual is
200 As noted above, we did not set strict criteria for transitions between block sizes in the present experiment.
201 However, a post hoc analysis showed that for all individuals, accuracy for the last four sessions of all block size
202 conditions was very high and showed no consistent increasing or decreasing trend, indicating that performance
203 immediately prior to the transition was stable. The percentages of correct trials immediately preceding the block switch
204 within a session in these last four sessions were 88.3% [standard error (SE) = 2.3] for the second-last trials and 90.1%
205 (SE = 2.1) for the last trials (see also Figures 4 and 5).
206 The dotted line in the graph shows the percentage of correct trials when the chimpanzees followed the Win-
207 Stay/Lose-Shift (WS/LS) strategy regarding position (Levine, 1959) completely for each trial block. For example,
208 consider the case of a 10-trial block. The first trial of the session has a 50% chance of being correct. After that, all of
209 the remaining nine trials will be correct according to the WS/LS strategy. Then, in the first trial immediately after the
210 block is switched, accuracy is 0% because the previous choice behavior is maintained. Therefore, in the 10-trial block,
211 the expected accuracy for the entire session would be 91.25% (= (40-3-0.5)/40) since there are 40 trials in one session,
212 four trial blocks are presented, and the block is switched three times.
213 Accuracy for the first trial of each block would be expected to be 0% if the chimpanzees had adopted the
214 complete WS/LS strategy as described above. On the other hand, if they had learned to switch their choice behavior in
215 response to the switching of force stimuli rather than the WS/LS strategy regarding position, there should be some
216 improvement during this training.

219 although it did not remain at 0%. Overall, all individuals did not reach the criterion of learning acquisition or completion
220 of trial block training for discrimination learning using force cues. Finally, after 88 sessions (up to 3/2 block) for Ai, 84
221 trials (back to 8-trial block after 3/2-block) for Ayumu, 41 sessions (5-trial block) for Pal, and 47 sessions (4-trial block)
222 for Pendesa, the experiment was interrupted due to time sharing requirements with other research projects running
223 concurrently.
225 Performance when switching blocks
226 Although there were no clear learning trends for improving performance throughout the sessions, we
227 observed that accuracy for the first trial of the block varied in a way that could not be explained by the WS/LS strategy
228 alone. Therefore, to examine this point in more detail, we analyzed the changes in performance before and after the
229 block switch.

panels. The vertical axis indicates the switching rate (see text for details). The horizontal axis indicates the trials before
and after block switching. The numbers above the panel indicate the block size. The blue and orange lines indicate the
results for switching from 8.0N to 0.5N and from 0.5N to 8.0N, respectively. Filled symbols indicate the results for the (n-
1)st block, and open symbols indicate the results for the nth block.
241 analyzed. Note that correction trials were excluded from the analysis. The left vertical axis shows the percentage of
242 correct trials, assuming that the correct stimulus in the nth block was also effective in the (n-1)st block. That is, for
243 example, if 8.0N was correct in the nth block, it indicates the percentage of correct trials, assuming that 8.0N was also
244 correct before the block switch. Therefore, this index (referred to as the switching rate) can be used to determine how
245 the switching of the correct stimulus affected performance. On the other hand, if we assume that the correct stimulus
246 in the (n-1)st block was maintained in the nth block, the bottom line of the graph would be 100% correct, and the top
247 line would be 0%, as shown by the vertical axis on the right. If the chimpanzees followed the WS/LS strategy with
248 respect to position, the switching rate at +1 would be 0% (no switching), whereas if they showed perfect force
249 discrimination, the rate would be 100% (switching).
252 cannot be explained simply by the WS/LS strategy alone. That is, the switching rate increased in the first trial
253 immediately after the switch from the last trial of the previous block. The mean difference in the switching rate between
254 the last trial of the block and the first trial of the next block for each individual was 20.2 percentage points for Ai, 19.4
255 points for Ayumu, 7.8 points for Pal, and 7.2 points for Pendesa, respectively.
256 Therefore, we performed a general linear mixed model (GLMM) analysis for the switching rate (binomially
257 distributed). We selected block size, the direction of correct stimulus switching (from 8.0N to 0.5N vs. from 0.5N to
258 8.0N), and trials before and after the block (-2, -1, +1, +2) as fixed effects, and chimpanzees and sessions (nested within
259 chimpanzees) as random effects. Among all possible models, we selected the model with the lowest Akaike's
260 information criteria (AIC) as the best model to predict the present results. The selected model included all fixed effects
261 as well as interactions between block size and switching direction, between block size and trial, and between switching
264 significant differences were found across conditions for the transition within the (n-1)st block, whereas all estimates
265 for the transition across blocks were significant, indicating an improvement in accuracy when switching blocks (βs >
trials across blocks (-1 vs. +1, orange). Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals based on Wald statistics. The
horizontal axis indicates block size. Note that the estimate for the within-block transition at block size 3/2 is not shown.

276 of force change between blocks: performance was better when switching from 0.5N to 8.0N than when switching from
277 8.0N to 0.5N. This difference was included as an interaction between switching direction and trial in the selected model
278 (β = 0.589, 95%CI [0.153, 1.028], Z = 2.647, p = 0.008). In psychophysics, the relationship between a stimulus and a
279 sensory or perceptual response is not strictly reversible when the stimulus intensity or characteristics are changed. This
280 phenomenon is called "hysteresis". Specifically, hysteresis occurs when the same stimulus intensity elicits different
281 sensory experiences in the ascending and descending directions (Vetter & Stadler, 1998). The phenomenon observed
282 in this study may correspond to this hysteresis.
284 Evaluation of the "counting" hypothesis
285 In this experiment, the number of trials was kept constant in each trial block, except for the 3/2 block
286 condition. This might have allowed the chimpanzees to "count" the number of trials in a block and use it as a cue for
287 switching behaviors between blocks. For example, previous studies have shown that chimpanzees successfully judge
288 the number of objects presented sequentially (Beran, 2001; Beran & Rumbaugh, 2001). Furthermore, studies of running
289 behavior by rats on a 1-way runway apparatus suggest that they may "count" the number of their own runs: the closer
290 they get to reinforcement, the faster their running speed increases (Capaldi & Miller, 1988). However, the accuracy of
291 the numerical judgment by the chimpanzees is not so precise, so it is suggested that approximate numerical
292 representation or analog magnitude estimation may contribute to their numerical judgment (Beran & Rumbaugh, 2001).
293 The results of rats' running behavior also indicate that the running speed did change gradually rather than suddenly. If
294 the chimpanzees had used the number of trials as a cue in this experiment, they would have judged the number based
295 on an analog magnitude estimation, not a precise one-by-one counting. And, if this "counting" hypothesis is true, then
296 we would expect the probability of switching behavior to increase gradually before the block switch. However, it is
297 clear from Figures 4 and 5 that their accuracy did not change gradually before and after the block switch.
298 In addition, as in humans, there is one specific phase in enumeration processes in chimpanzees called
299 "subitizing," in which performance is very good and stable when the number is four or less, regardless of the magnitude
300 of the number (Matsuzawa, 1985; Murofushi, 1997; Tomonaga & Matsuzawa, 2002). Therefore, if they had used the
301 number of trials as a cue, they should have been able to identify the exact number of trials for block size 4, which is
302 within the subitizing range, and should have shown discontinuous changes in performance before and after the block
303 switch, whereas for block sizes 8 and 10, which are outside the subitizing range, there should have been a gradual
304 decline in performance toward the last trial of the block (i.e., an increase in the frequency with which behavioral
305 switching occurs before the block switch), as predicted earlier. Therefore, we checked the percentage of correct trials
306 on the last two trials for block sizes 4, 8, and 10 and found that the results were the opposite of our prediction: 84.3%
307 for block size 4, compared to 95.4% for block size 8, and 97.4% for block size 10.

320 Preliminary analysis of trackball manipulation
321 Data from the trackball were output as the position of the cursor coordinates at each sampling time. In the
322 present study, we did not perform a detailed analysis of these data but rather a preliminary analysis of how the
323 chimpanzees manipulated the trackball under the different force feedback conditions. We sampled 15 trials per
324 individual for each force condition and analyzed movement speed, acceleration, and distance traveled based on these
325 data.
327 movement speed (movement speed, 30.2 pixels/s for 0.5N and 20.3 pixels/s for 8.0N, t(3) = 6.497, p = 0.007, r = 0.966;
328 acceleration, t(3) = 0.814, p = 0.475, r = 0.426; distance traveled, t(3) = 1.754, p = 0.178, r = 0.712). These results
329 suggest that the chimpanzees moved the cursor faster in the 0.5N condition than in the 8.0N condition.

339 Discussion
340 In this study, we trained force discrimination on chimpanzees using the trackball device capable of force
341 feedback. They were trained to perform a conditional position discrimination task in which they were required to
342 differentially choose one of the two stimuli on the screen based on force feedback during trackball manipulation. We
343 used trial-block training, in which the same force stimulus was repeatedly presented for a fixed number of trials, and
344 the block size was gradually decreased, with the final training scheduled to be conducted under conditions in which
345 two types of force stimuli were randomly presented. However, none of the chimpanzees reached the learning criterion.
346 In the previous studies in which visual discrimination had been trained using a similar trial-block procedure, this
347 procedure had facilitated the acquisition of the task (Tomonaga & Ohta, 1990), but no such facilitating effect was
348 observed in the present experiment. One reason for this discrepancy may be that the chimpanzees in this study had
349 previously been intensively trained and tested on visual discrimination tasks for most of the tasks (see Tomonaga, 2001).
350 As a result of this long-term experimental history, they may have always attended first to the visual modality in the
351 particular experimental environment. In fact, when they were tested using auditory stimuli, they performed very poorly.
352 (Takiyama, 2019; Martinez & Matsuzawa, 2009a).
353 Another reason may be that the present experimental procedure was a kind of cross-modal task. Chimpanzees
354 were asked to select one of the visual stimuli based on the differences in force feedback from the trackball (conditioned
355 position discrimination task), which required them to make arbitrary cross-modal matching between tactile and visual
356 stimuli. Such tasks, for example, cross-modal tasks with auditory stimuli, have been reported to be difficult for
357 chimpanzees. (Hashiya & Kojima, 1997, 2001; Martinez & Matsuzawa, 2009a,b).
358 For example, if a Go/No-Go task had been introduced (e.g., Tomonaga & Ohta, 1990; Kaneko et al., 2013;
359 Ueda et al., 2012), in which the chimpanzees continued to rotate the trackball at 0.5 N but not at 8.0 N, they might have
360 learned this task more readily. If the main purpose of the study is a psychophysical measurement of haptic perception,
361 such simpler tasks will provide sufficiently important results (cf. Sinclair & Burton, 1991a,b, 1993). Further studies on
362 this point are needed in the future.
363 As mentioned in the Methods section, we predicted that the present task would be very difficult for the
364 chimpanzees, so we adopted the trial-block procedure to allow for step-by-step learning. However, as the results showed,
365 this procedure alone was not sufficient to meet the learning criterion. Therefore, as a future prospect, we can consider
366 introducing another step-by-step training method instead. One such procedure is the stimulus fading procedure (Terrace,
367 1963). This is a type of errorless learning procedure in which relatively easy tasks are trained first, and then the
368 discrimination stimuli for more difficult tasks are faded in while the existing stimuli are gradually faded out (Terrace,
369 1963; Fields et al., 1976). This method has also been used in tactile-visual cross-modal matching in rhesus macaques
370 (Malone et al., 1980). In their study, macaques were introduced to stimulus fading by gradually making the screen
371 opaque in front of a 3-dimensional object after they had learned a matching task in which they touched a 3-dimensional
372 object while viewing it and then selected a photograph of that object. In addition, intervention studies in human
373 developmental disabilities have reported the facilitating effects of stimulus fading in audiovisual cross-modal matching
374 (e.g., Goetz et al., 1982).
375 It would be feasible to introduce stimulus fading into the present task. For example, in our experiment, the
376 color of the field during the force feedback was gray, but by matching it to the color of the correct stimulus (e.g., red
377 or green), the chimpanzees could readily learn conditional position discrimination of color (plus friction force). Since
378 the chimpanzees in this study had already learned color matching (Hirosawa, 2010; Matsuno et al., 2004), this task
379 would be easy for them to learn. Then, the saturation of the field gradually decreased while maintaining the
380 discrimination to a gray field of equal luminance. Whether such a procedure is effective or not will be further
381 investigated in the future.
382 Although the chimpanzees did not reach the final learning criterion, a closer analysis of the results showed
383 that there was indeed some evidence of learning. In fact, accuracy on the first trial of the block did not remain at 0%
385 according to the correct or incorrect outcome of the trial (WS/LS strategy). In that case, the accuracy on the first trial
386 of the block should be 0%. However, this was not the case. The present results indicate that the chimpanzees'
387 discrimination behavior did not simply follow the WS/LS strategy but strongly suggest that the change in force feedback
388 itself may have served to some extent as a discriminative cue for switching stimulus choice. However, it is also true
389 that this change in force did not result in sufficient control of choice behavior. The reason for this, as noted above, may
390 well be due to the experimental history of the participants and the unavoidable complexity of the task itself.
391 In the trial-block procedure used in this experiment, the number of trials in the block was fixed except for the
392 3/2 block condition. Such a manipulation allows the number of trials within a block itself to be used as a cue for
393 switching behavior. However, results from previous studies of chimpanzee numerical judgment and post hoc analyses
394 of our results suggest that this possibility is unlikely. However, to strictly avoid this possibility in the future,
395 manipulations such as variable trial block sizes would be required (cf. Niemi & Näätänen, 1981; Zeiler, 2022).
396 Thus far, we have discussed the possibility that the chimpanzees used the force stimuli presented by the force-
397 feedback device as a discriminative cue, but it should also be considered that they might have used different cues. For
399 have used their hand movements or the time spent manipulating the trackball as cues to solve the task rather than
401 manipulation time) of 2:3 (0.67) when manipulating the trackball. If this temporal ratio were sufficiently discriminable
402 for the chimpanzees, it would be possible to use speed or manipulation time as a discriminative cue. Unfortunately,
403 there are few psychophysical studies of temporal discrimination in chimpanzees, although discrimination between 108
404 and 138 BPM of a metronome beat (ratio of 0.78) has been reported (Bierens de Haan, 1951; Prestrude, 1971). It has
405 also been reported that rhesus macaques did discriminate between 1.5 and 2.18 seconds (ratio of 0.69) with a 75%
406 correct response rate. Based on these findings, it may be possible for chimpanzees to discriminate the difference in
407 velocity between 20 and 30 pixels/s. To rule out the temporal discrimination account, we could, for example, equalize
408 the arrival time to the target circle between the different force conditions by manipulating the correspondence between
409 trackball rotation and cursor movement (control-display ratio or control-display gain; Arnaut & Greenstein, 1990;
410 Casiez et al., 2008) while maintaining the difference in force stimuli, or, conversely, equalize the force stimuli and test
411 under conditions such that differences in arrival time are generated by manipulating the control-display gain. These
412 possibilities need to be examined in the future.
413 The chimpanzees performed better when switching from 0.5N to 8.0N than when switching from 8.0N to
414 0.5N during block switching (Figures 4 and 5). This can be discussed from a psychophysical point of view as hysteresis,
415 but it might also be discussed as a form of forward masking, where the preceding stimulus inhibits the perception of
416 the following stimulus. Indeed, masking has been reported to occur in tactual perception in humans (e.g., Abramsky et
417 al., 1971; Zook et al., 2021). However, since masking does not usually occur over a long period as in the present
418 experiment, but rather with a time lag of less than 1 second (Shimizu, 1984), it should be discussed with caution.
419 Furthermore, this performance asymmetry could possibly be discussed in terms of the correspondence
420 between stimulus magnitude and spatial mapping. In humans, there is a well-known SNARC effect, the correspondence
421 between quantities such as numbers and spatial directions such as up and down or left and right (Dehaene et al., 1993).
422 This effect is not limited to the numerical dimension but is also observed in the correspondence between other
423 quantitative dimensions and spatial mappings (e.g., Evans & Treisman, 2000). Furthermore, SNARC-like effects and
424 cross-modal mappings between quantitative dimensions have been reported in great apes, including chimpanzees
425 (Adachi, 2014; Dahl & Adachi, 2013; Ludwig et al., 2011; Johnson-Ulrich & Vonk, 2018; Gaze et al., 2017, 2023; cf.
426 Beran et al., 2019).
427 In the conditional position discrimination used in our study, 8.0N (rough, heavy, strong) was mapped to the
428 top and 0.5N (smooth, light, weak) to the bottom in all chimpanzees. The possibility that this mapping affected
429 performance asymmetry during task acquisition and block switching may be open to further investigation. In the future,
430 it may be possible to examine the relationship between friction force and spatial mapping of responses by
431 counterbalancing the mapping conditions across individuals or by introducing cross-modal "arbitrary" matching instead
432 of conditional position discrimination and then manipulating the relationship between friction force and spatial mapping
433 of responses on each trial.
434 In the present study, the chimpanzees did not reach the final training phase (i.e., completion of discrimination
435 under the condition that the two force stimuli were presented randomly). We have discussed the reasons for this failure
436 and some indications of discrimination learning. Haptic perception has always been an important topic in humans, for
437 example, in the study of virtual reality (Kern et al., 2023; Tanaka & Kubota, 2022; Tanaka et al., 2023), but in
438 comparative studies with nonhuman primates, it has been on the decline since the cross-modal perception studies of
439 the 1960s to 1970s, with a few exceptions in neurophysiological studies. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of
440 advanced technology, as demonstrated in this study, can pave the way for new research avenues in the field of tactile
441 perception and cognition from a comparative cognitive perspective. From this perspective, this study represents an
442 important step forward in its potential to enhance our understanding of these aspects.
