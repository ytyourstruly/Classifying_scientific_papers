The Swiss Cheese Model of Social Cues: A Theoretical Perspective on the Complex
Interplay of Social Cues in Shaping Social Media’s effect on Adolescent Well-Being
Abstract
Media effects research has observed significant diversity in the effects of social media on
adolescent well-being, with outcomes ranging from positive to negative and, in some cases,
neutral effects. In an effort to comprehend and elucidate this diversity, we have formulated The
Swiss Cheese Model of Social Cues, a theoretical framework that systematically categorizes
potential sources contributing to these variations. This dynamic model encompasses the
complex layers of social cues present within platforms, the social environment, and individual
(neuro)susceptibility, collectively shaping how social media influences the well-being of
adolescents. The primary goal of this model is to enhance research by concurrently considering
a broader range of individual difference factors, providing a comprehensive framework for
investigations into the complex interplay of social cues and their effects.

The Swiss Cheese Model of Social Cues: Theoretical Perspective on the Complex
Interplay of Social Cues in Shaping Social Media’s effect on Adolescent Well-Being
Social media have become a ubiquitous part of adolescents’ lives. Social media provide
adolescents with endless opportunities for exploration, connection, and self-expression as well
as constant access to quantifiable social rewards and feedback in the forms of likes, followers,
and comments. These unique features of social media complement the physical,
neurobiological, and socioemotional changes that characterize adolescence, thereby
intensifying their sensitivity to social information (Blakemore & Mills, 2014). Not surprisingly,
then, this era of constant connectivity has prompted numerous voices in the public sphere to
proclaim social media’s influence on youth’s psychosocial well-being. The research, however,
has produced mixed results at best. While some studies support the claim of negative effects
(e.g., Twenge et al., 2018), others urge nuance (e.g., Orben & Przybylski, 2019). The research
seems at an impasse with scholars calling into question both empirical and theoretical claims
on the role of social media in adolescent well-being and development.
In an attempt to resolve this impasse in the literature, the current manuscript presents a
theoretical framework that reestablishes the fundamental “social” aspect into the study of
social media effects. In fact, social media use is seldom disconnected from the social context;
instead, it is influenced, shaped, and sustained by complex social dynamics and an individual’s
attunement to those dynamics. This perspective is especially important for our understanding
of adolescents’ social media use, given the salience of social cues during this developmental
period (Blakemore & Mills, 2014). A prominent feature motivating adolescents to use social
media is its instant gratification of both social and emotional needs, such as those involved in
identity development and relationship formation including self-expression, validation from
peers, and a sense of belonging (Deci & Ryan, 2012).
However, the contradictory research findings that demonstrate how social media can
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 4
simultaneously enhance the lives of certain users in specific circumstances (e.g., by fostering
social connectedness), while also posing challenges for others (e.g., by inducing stress or
feelings of exclusion), indicate that there are crucial boundary conditions to resilient social
media use (Principle of Social Media Variability). With resilient social media use, we refer to
one’s ability to navigate and interact within the digital social landscape while maintaining
emotional well-being, mental health, and a balanced sense of self. It involves the capacity to
withstand negative experiences while focusing on positive interactions. This ultimately results
in positive social media effects (e.g., improved well-being) and adaptive social media
use/engagement behaviors (e.g., self-regulation and occasional disconnection). We propose
that by examining the intricate interplay of multiple types of social cues, we can uncover the
factors that determine which adolescents thrive in their use of social media and under what
conditions and which adolescents might face challenges. Embracing a Swiss cheese perspective
social influences act as mitigating factors, determining resilient social media use. By
incorporating the inherent social aspect into our understanding of social media effects, we can
also strengthen the endurance of the Swiss cheese model. This approach allows us to transcend
particular technological advancements and industry trends (e.g., new apps) and instead
prioritize examining the social dynamics by which social media is utilized.
The Inherent Social Dynamics of Social Media Use
Adolescence is considered a complex developmental stage with many physical,
behavioral and social changes (Blakemore & Mills, 2014). In adolescence, two pivotal
developmental tasks involve establishing an identity and pursuing autonomy, while also
forming affiliations and seeking acceptance from peers (Blakemore & Mills, 2014). Social
media serve as effective tools to address (certain aspects of) these developmental tasks by
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 5
fostering identity development and facilitating relationship formation (Throuvala et al., 2019).
In essence, social media are defined as “computer-mediated communication channels that
allow users to engage in social interaction with broad and narrow audiences in real time or
asynchronously” (Bayer et al., 2020; p. 316). At the same time, the literature has often conflated
social media with specific platforms (e.g., TikTok, Instagram, or Facebook; Masur et al., 2022)
or takes an affordance-approach where social media are defined by their general characteristics
(e.g., interactivity, (a)synchronicity). A valuable approach to understanding social media
involves exploring the motivations that drive users to engage with these platforms, akin to
adopting a toolkit approach (Bayer et al., 2020). Individuals utilize a specific set of features to
achieve diverse objectives, whether it's active use for self-presentation or entertainment-
seeking, or more passive use like browsing content without active interaction.
For instance, research on adolescent self-presentation highlights the adaptive role of
social media in facilitating identity exploration through impression management
(Subrahmanyam & Šmahel, 2011). The unique features of social media, such as asynchronicity
and increased control, empower young users to skillfully curate their online persona, by
accentuating or downplaying certain aspects of the self (Siibak, 2009). The intentional and
social nature of online presentation provides opportunities for both self-reflection and ego-
validation. Notably, as online self-presentation is subject to peer evaluation (Walther et al.,
2011), the feedback assists adolescents in shaping both their identity and social position.
Additionally, the distinct characteristics of social media, including the quantification of
social interactions (likes, views, followers), have significantly transformed adolescent
development and their peer relationships (Nesi et al., 2018). For one, these platforms amplified
the immediacy and frequency of interactions among adolescents and their peers – allowing
adolescents instant social interactive gratification. The positive emotions, rewards, and benefits
derived from social interactions such as connecting with others, receiving validation, support,
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 6
or feedback, and experiencing a sense of belonging or social connectedness can thereby foster
positive well-being and self-esteem. At the same time, the instant gratification of social needs
may contribute to increased reassurance-seeking, a continued reliance on others for validating
one’s identity and self-worth, and increased pressures for relationship maintenance and
accessibility (Nesi et al., 2018). These important drawbacks hold particular relevance for
adolescents who, influenced by biological changes, become more attuned to social cues
(Blakemore & Mills, 2014) and are still in the process of developing executive functioning
skills (i.e., inhibitory control) (Berthelsen et al., 2017). Given that the evaluation,
representation, and processing of self-concept information are fundamentally social processes
(Blakemore & Mills, 2014), and social media platforms provide avenues to access such
information, adolescents’ involvement with social media is inherently driven and shaped by
social dynamics (Nesi et al., 2018)
The Swiss Cheese Model of Social Cues
Our aim to incorporate the social dynamics inherent in social media use is not a novel
concept. A decade ago, the differential susceptibility model of media effects proposed that
social contexts, such as peer norms, can amplify or mitigate the effects of media (Valkenburg
& Peter, 2013). Similarly, the resonance-hypothesis found in media theories such as cultivation
theory (Shrum, 2017), assumes that certain messages resonate more with individuals based on
their social reality and interactions. More recently, Masur et al. (2022) advocated for a
situational perspective by distinguishing between personal (e.g., traits, attitudes) and
environmental factors (e.g., culture, norms) as contextual elements influencing the relationship
between social media and well-being. Despite the strengths of these perspectives in accounting
for specific types of social cues in the observed effects, there remains a significant oversight in
both empirical and theoretical approaches regarding a systematic understanding of how
different types of social cues—encompassing individual, social network, and channel-specific
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 7
factors—intersect and collectively shape social media use and its effects on youth outcomes.
We present a conceptual framework that considers the role of social context as an
found within social media platforms. A second layer encompasses the immediate social
environment in which social media is used, specifically one’s (position within) peer networks
and family relationships. Finally, a third layer examines the individual level, focusing on
individual susceptibility to social cues. Utilizing the Swiss Cheese model (Reason, 2000), we
illustrate how these layers intersect to enhance resilient social media use, represented by arrows
negate negative social media experiences and redirect towards positive influences. Each slice
represents a layer of social cues providing a distinct condition that influences whether the
content, interaction, or activity on social media permeates the mental state of the user, for better
or worse. We believe that during adolescence, a critical developmental stage, young users may
have fewer slices or more holes, rendering them more vulnerable/less resilient to the (negative)
use and effects of social media. It is crucial to recognize that these layers coexist
simultaneously, not in a sequential order, allowing for variations within and between
individuals at different moments. The interlocking gears symbolize their interconnectedness
and collective influence on outcomes. For example, during social exclusion, a highly socially
sensitive adolescent may be more affected by an idealized selfie with many likes. Conversely,
a highly accepted adolescent with low sensitivity to social cues may perceive the same selfie
differently, potentially reacting by ignoring or opposing such idealized content.
Layer One – Social Cues Within Social Media Platforms
We first assume that there are social cues within social media platforms (e.g., likes,
anticipation, and social norms) that significantly affect how users perceive and respond to their
online experiences (Assumption of Social Cues Significance). Building and expanding upon
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 8
prior work aimed at establishing contextual stability in social media effects, we differentiate
between social media elements (i.e., the profile, the stream, and the connection) and focus on
the social cues present within those elements. Defining social media based on its apparent and
intuitive elements aligns with the way users perceive it. Therefore, it may better grasp the
(social) expectations, schemas, scripts, and goals related to different features of social media.
This definition becomes particularly relevant in the context of our model, where we aim to
explore how youth can effectively use social media to satisfy their needs in an adaptive manner.
The Profile. First, one of the most apparent and easily recognizable features of social
media is the profile. It serves as a digital representation of the user, allowing them to share
information about themselves in a personalized space (Bayer et al., 2020). Adolescents, in
particular, spend considerable time deliberating and monitoring their online persona. In line
with self-determination (Deci & Ryan, 2012), adolescents’ extensive engagement with social
media can be attributed to its capacity to (promptly) satisfy their self-presentation and identity
development needs. Social media platforms provide a space for adolescents to explore and
construct their identities online, engaging in a process of continual self-reflection and
reconstruction (Subrahmanyam & Šmahel, 2011). Friends and peers play a significant role in
this process, acting as mirrors as adolescents experiment with and reflect on different aspects
of their selves (i.e., the looking-glass self theory; Cooley, 1902). The highly visible and
quantifiable peer feedback on social media platforms makes the anticipation of social rewards
(e.g., likes, positive comments, traction) salient and serve as a crucial social cue that shapes
adolescents' decisions regarding self-presentation (Subrahmanyam & Šmahel, 2011).
The anticipation of social rewards is intricately connected to norm perceptions and the
imagined audience for each social media post. As evidenced by norm literature, human
behavior is influenced by both descriptive norms (what others are doing) and injunctive norms
(what others approve of) (White et al., 2009). In the context of self-presentation, it can be
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 9
assumed that adolescents take into consideration what is expected of them by others when
making decisions about how they present themselves online. For example, research on the
positive bias on social media (i.e., the highly selective, curated and unspontaneous stream of
content where a favorable self-presentation dominates; Schreurs & Vandenbosch, 2021) has
revealed that adolescents who are aware of this bias are more likely to engage in positivity
biased behaviors themselves, such as posting edited photos (Schreurs & Vandenbosch, 2022)
or actively searching digital status indicators (Authors, submitted manuscript). Moreover, these
decisions are significantly influenced by the audience adolescents imagine will see their posts,
taking into account factors like whether the content will be ephemeral (fleeting), private, or
public. Driven by developmental and cognitive progress linked to the separation-individuation
process, this imaginary audience, or the belief to be the object of others’ attention and
evaluation, peaks during adolescence (Cingel & Krcmar, 2014). Importantly, the awareness of
this audience - whether real or imagined - can hold users accountable for their actions and
thereby influence social media related choices (Stsiampkouskaya et al., 2021).
The Stream. A second prominent social media element is the stream, which refers to
the constant flow of information. Social media offer a unique catalog of other people’s lives as
well as the responses received from their network and can therefore naturally lend itself to
social comparison processes (Bayer et al., 2020). We propose that mere exposure to this stream
of highly curated and therefore oftentimes idealized content may not be sufficient to understand
its potential influence on individuals (see mixed findings found across meta-analyses; Odgers
& Jensen, 2020). Instead, it is the social cues surrounding the content that co-determine its
impact. Specifically, following the tenets of warranting theory, the less control users have over
a piece of information the more that information is viewed as credible (DeAndrea, 2014). In
this regard, status signals and thus the endorsement of content by others may shape perceptions
and the associated effects. Notably, the bandwagon effect describes a phenomenon where
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 10
people internalize certain messages because they believe that others around them are doing the
same (Kim, 2021). In an online context, bandwagon cues refer to any representation of
collective reactions to online content, including views and likes, and are also known as social
endorsement cues (Messing & Westwood, 2014), which are particularly relevant in the context
of our model. Notably, research among adolescents shows that ‘likes’ can elicit neural and
behavioral responses; When adolescents view photos with many (as compared to few) likes -
regardless of the content being risky or neutral - their neural activation in reward-related
regions increases, influencing their likelihood of liking the photo (Sherman et al., 2016).
Consequently, the functional value of these social cues plays a pivotal role in shaping both
positive and negative social media effects, contingent upon the specific content. For instance,
significant endorsement of positive peer norms can lead to increased positive behaviors (e.g.,
water consumption; Polman et al., 2023), but further research is needed to explore whether this
extends to prosocial behaviors or positive self-perception.
The Connection. Lastly, we acknowledge the connection element in social media, which
combines the network and message elements (Bayer et al., 2020). Adolescents' extensive use
of social media is believed to be driven by its capacity to fulfill social needs, such as a sense
of belongingness and connection. With the prevalence of mobile technology enabling constant
connectivity, the immediate gratification of these needs has become the norm. Surely these
affordances can make social media highly adaptive in assisting adolescents to seek the social
support they crave at a certain time, fostering a sense of belonging and alleviating feelings of
isolation (Verduyn et al., 2017) In addition, social media provide social connection in ways
not available in real life – such as facilitating having online only friends – which has been
shown to be particularly protective for at risk teens (Massing-Schaffer et al., 2022). On the
other hand, negative effects may arise when needs of connectedness are unmet or when
stressors emerge. Indeed, some studies suggest that adolescents can experience digital stress
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 11
(Nick et al., 2022) and ostracism (i.e., being ignored or excluded by others; Williams, 2009)
which may in turn result in feelings of alienation and depression.
Layer two – The social dynamics surrounding social media use
The assumption that an individual's use of social media is influenced by a larger social
context has long been a focus of media research (Friemel, 2021). The networked effects
framework recognizes individuals as embedded within networks connecting them to other users
and media content, emphasizing that their actions on social media are not isolated but shaped
by these networks and, in turn, impact the social context for others (Friemel, 2021). While not
currently within the scope of this manuscript, it is crucial to acknowledge that adolescents’
online content is not solely dictated by their own social network but influenced by algorithms
and thus shaped by adolescents’ own behaviors online. Within the Swiss Cheese model, we
specifically aim to establish the significance of parents and peers as crucial social contexts that
shape adolescents' use of social media, while also being influenced and affected by it.
Peer Context. Substantial research has documented the crucial role of peer context in
shaping adolescent development and well-being (e.g., Nesi et al., 2018). Compared to children,
adolescents spend significantly more time in the company of their peers and are more receptive
to peer influence and peer rejection than adults (e.g., Silvers et al., 2012). Within the context
of social media, the type of content adolescents are exposed to can vary based on the
characteristics of their friendship clique. Body image scholarship, for instance, has revealed
that adolescents in appearance-focused cliques are more likely to encounter appearance-related
content, potentially feeling pressured to confirm to certain beauty standards (Paxton et al.,
1999). Likewise, if a peer group emphasizes constant availability and responsiveness on social
media, adolescents may face digital stress in their friendships (De Groote & Van Ouytsel,
2022). The increased stress from peer interactions (Silvers et al., 2012) underscores how the
characteristics of one's social network influence social media experiences.
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 12
Another crucial dimension of the peer context influencing social media experiences and
effects is the dynamics of social relationships and networks, including social status. The social
status of adolescents within both offline and online networks can shape their engagement with
social media and its influence on them. For instance, individuals experiencing social isolation
or lacking strong friendship ties in both online and offline contexts may rely more on social
media for social interaction and validation. During social exclusion, seeking support becomes
likely, particularly if acceptance appears secure (Bayer et al., 2018). The constant connectivity
provided by mobile technology and social media allows adolescents to access this support.
Similarly, those with well-established friendship networks may use social media to maintain
and strengthen existing connections (i.e., the rich-get-richer hypothesis; Bouchillon, 2022).
Additionally, research has shown that adolescents with higher levels of peer acceptance
(i.e., likeability) are likely to possess higher levels of emotional competence (Mavroveli et al.,
2007) – encompassing emotional intelligence and regulation – which, in turn, have been
considered crucial components of social media literacy (Schreurs & Vandenbosch, 2021).
Consequently, likeable adolescents might use emotional regulation skills during stressful
online experiences and as such may be more resilient in their social media use. Furthermore,
there is literature indicating that having one or two close friends might be a sufficient buffer
against the risk associated with other social difficulties, such as low social status, rejection or
peer victimization (Laursen et al., 2007). This type of buffering effect has also been established
for having online only friends (Massing-Schaffer et al., 2022). These findings show the
importance of considering adolescent’s position within their social network as a crucial
condition shaping social media use and effects.
Parent Context. In the realm of adolescent development, parents continue to hold a
significant role alongside the increasing influence of peers (Grusec & Hastings, 2014). Parents
have been grappling ways to help their children navigate the digital world safely and are thus
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 13
likely to shape adolescents' social media use and their ability to navigate it in a healthy manner.
This active involvement of parents in mediating their children's media behavior is commonly
referred to as parental mediation (Daneels & Vanwynsberghe, 2017). Within the context of
social media, parents employ various strategies such as open communication (active
mediation), setting boundaries and limitations (restrictive mediation), and participating in their
children's online activities through co-use. These efforts aim to assist adolescents in developing
a balanced approach to social media and reducing potential negative effects.
The research on parental mediation in the context of social media use, however, is not
entirely conclusive. Restrictive mediation and co-use may pose challenges for parents due to
limited knowledge about these technologies (Daneels & Vanwynsberghe, 2017). Additionally,
Intrusive attempts by parents to control their children's online behaviors have encountered
mistrust and resistance, hindering adolescents' autonomy (Kerr et al., 2010). Still, actively
discussing certain aspects of online media, including the presence of online positivity bias
(Schreurs & Vandenbosch, 2021), has shown potential to enhance children's media literacy.
For successful active mediation, children need to be willing to share their (online) experiences
with their parents. While limited research directly links disclosure to family quality, there are
indications that such sharing is more common in cohesive families (Dost-Gözkan, 2022).
It is thus worth considering the indirect influence of the parental context on adolescents’
ability to navigate the positive and negative aspects of social media interactions. Specifically,
a supportive environment created by parents can foster resilience (Morris et al., 2017).
Following family development perspectives, family cohesion has been linked with decreased
emotional distress and anxiety through the mechanisms of increased effortful control and self-
regulation (Augustine et al., 2022). Through its association with enhanced self-regulatory
skills, higher affective quality of family relationships may encourage more responsible social
media use among adolescents. This highlights the importance of the parental role in shaping
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 14
their children's experiences with social media and promoting their well-being in the digital age.
Reality vs Imagined. When examining the influence of the social context on adolescents'
use of social media, the environment may be considered from two distinct perspectives. The
first perspective is the objective reality of the environment, which includes tangible factors
such as peer-nominated status indicators (e.g., popularity) or explicit social norms. This aspect
reflects the actual social landscape in which adolescents navigate their social media
interactions. For instance, sociometric scores can provide insight into the hierarchical structure
within a peer group and the perceived social status associated with different individuals.
The second perspective involves the perceived reality, which encompasses the
subjective experiences and interpretations of individuals within their social context. This
subjective representation of the environment is constructed and shaped by the individual's own
thoughts, beliefs, and emotions. In the context of social media, adolescents' perceived reality
may be influenced by their own interpretations of the content they encounter, the feedback they
receive from peers, their own self-perception in relation to others, and norm perceptions.
Importantly, this subjective experience can also significantly impact their behaviors and
interactions on social media platforms.
By considering both the external factors and the internal representations within the
minds of individuals, we can gain insights into the complex dynamics that contribute to
adolescents' engagement with social media and its impact on their social experiences
(Assumption of Social Dynamics in the Environment).
Layer three - Individual (neuro)sensitivity to social cues
Early adolescence often marks the first entry into the digital world (Livingstone et al.,
2011). Concurrently, this developmental stage is characterized by neurobiological changes that
increase teens’ responsiveness to their social context (Schriber & Guyer, 2016), which can
intensify their motivation to pursue peer connections and social status (Crone & Dahl, 2012).
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 15
According to the theory of neurobiological susceptibility to the environment (Schriber &
Guyer, 2016), notable individual distinctions arise in how responsive individuals are to their
social context (Ellis et al., 2011). It is assumed that this heightened responsiveness during
adolescence guides individuals, especially those more susceptible, to prioritize elements that
hold particular relevance within the social setting. Due to how the brain encodes cues from the
social context, this attunement can extend to both positive and negative cues (Schriber &
Guyer, 2016). Specifically, adolescents’ sensitivity to social context does not only apply to
increased risk behaviors but can also extend towards positive behaviors, pro-sociability, and
resilience (e.g., Ahmed et al., 2020). For instance, connectivity within neural regions in the
affective salience network has been shown to influence the link between peer norms and
positive and negative behaviors in adolescence; Those with heightened neural connectivity tend
to engage in risk taking when exposed to negative peer norms but engage in prosocial behaviors
when confronted with positive peer norms. Importantly, adolescents with low neural
connectivity appear to be resilient to peer group norms (Do et al., 2022).
In sum, individuals with lower sensitivity are less likely to be influenced by either
positive or negative social contexts. However, those with higher sensitivity are more
susceptible to both unfavorable and favorable contexts, leading this susceptibility to be best
understood in a for-better and for-worse fashion (Schriber & Guyer, 2016; Telzer et al., 2021).
With the premise that these individual differences in neurobiological sensitivity interact with
the social context in predicting adolescent behavior (Telzer et al., 2021), acknowledging
individual susceptibility in the context of social media use becomes paramount. As a significant
and growing social context during adolescence, the impact of social media on adolescent well-
being is likely to be shaped by an individuals’ attunement to social cues, including likes, norms,
expectations, etc. Research exploring the brain-related aspects of social media effects – with
either brain development as an outcome (e.g., Maza et al., 2023) or the brain as a factor
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 16
influencing the examining effects (e.g., Authors, submitted manuscript) – are only beginning
to emerge, but already underscore its significance.
Another fruitful approach to consider the brain within social media effects involves
understanding the mechanisms underlying cognitive control and self-regulation. Specifically,
the greater plasticity in adolescent brains helps them to adapt to their environment and
effectively channel their attention and motivation toward cues they value (Telzer et al., 2023).
Within a social media context, we argue that the very elements capturing adolescents' attention
– social cues like likes, followers, etc. – might also constrain their self-regulatory impulses.
Notably, a pivotal aspect of resilient social media use is attention control - involving the ability
to redirect attention from negative to positive interactions - which underpins self-regulation
(Dishion & Connell, 2006). Adolescents have demonstrated flexible cognitive control, heavily
contingent on environmental factors (see Davidow et al., 2018). If sensitive adolescents are
confronted with social cues (e.g., within social media but also their social networks), their
capacity to engage their self-regulatory abilities might be compromised, affecting their ability
to resist adverse social media interactions and concentrate on more positive ones.
A crucial point to emphasize is that other dispositional factors (e.g., personality and
self-esteem) are equally important individual boundary conditions for (social) media effects,
as proposed by the differential susceptibility to media effects model (Valkenburg & Peter,
2013). However, the present theoretical manuscript seeks to integrate, for the first time,
adolescents' neurobiological susceptibility into social media effects research. Therefore, we
propose that individuals vary in their susceptibility to social information, driven by
neurobiological sensitivity, which influences how they respond to social cues within the online
environment (Assumption of Individual Susceptibility).
The Interplay of The Three Layers
With nearly one in five U.S. adolescents reporting that they are virtually always online,
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 17
and two out of three using social media daily (Pew Research Center, 2022), it is crucial to
understand the dual nature of social media: a tool that can be both beneficial and challenging.
To explore when and how adolescents adaptively navigate negative interactions while fostering
positive ones (i.e., resilient social media use), we have proposed dissecting the intricate
interplay of relevant social cues. We emphasize that individual resilience factors (e.g., strong
peer/parent connections) may not singularly protect youth from negative social media effects
or harness positive ones. Instead, research should consider the concurrent interplay of the
multifaceted layers.
We posit that a positive social media effect materializes when a favorable/positive
online interaction aligns with an amalgamation of social cue-related factors such that it
(momentarily) imbues the users' mental state with positivity, thus culminating in a beneficial
outcome (resilient social media use). On the other hand, a negative social media effect arises
when an adverse online interaction aligns with an analogous convergence of social cue-related
factors, such that this negative effect permeates the users' mental state, consequently yielding
an adverse outcome. Additionally, we may encounter a null effect, denoting an instance in
which the social media interaction does not influence the user due to certain layers of influence
that obstruct its impact, a phenomenon we also refer to as resilient social media use. As such,
the Swiss Cheese Model of Social Cues incorporates the Collective Influence Assumption: The
dynamic and multifaceted collective influence of the proposed social cues (i.e., those within
the platforms and the social environment and one’s individual susceptibility to social cues)
shapes both social media use behaviors and their effects on well-being. The interaction among
these factors results in a range of well-being effects and social media use behaviors, which may
be amplified or attenuated based on the specific combination of influences in a given context.
Although the Swiss Cheese Model of Social Cues contends that comprehending the use
and effects of social media necessitates a broader perspective encompassing various social
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 18
cues, it is equally important to note that not all types of social cues are essential for generating
an 'effect,' and there is no predetermined sequential order among these different types of cues.
Overall, the starting point of the model is some form of social media use/engagement/exposure
with some form of psychosocial outcome as the end point. A positive outcome (e.g., improved
the nature of this association – whether it manifests as positive, negative, or null - is contingent
upon the specific composition of the suggested layers and cues within the model.
To demonstrate the innate adaptability of the Swiss Cheese Model, we will illustrate its
applicability against the background of digital stress, positivity bias exposure, and ‘in the
moment’ or situational social media use.
Digital stress. Digital stress, characterized as the "stress arising from extensive and
potentially constant use of information and communication technology... triggered by constant
exposure to an overwhelming quantity and diversity of (social) content" (Hefner and Vorderer,
2016, p. 237), is a multifaceted phenomenon. Researchers have identified five subcomponents
of digital stress (i.e., availability stress, approval anxiety, fear of missing out, connection
overload and online vigilance; Steele et al., 2020), all of which have been associated with
psychosocial stress (see recent meta-analysis; Khetawat & Steele, 2023). However, not all
studies reveal significant associations between digital stress and compromised psychosocial
well-being (e.g., Best et al., 2014). It is argued that digital stress is subjective, and often
contingent on an individual’s coping resources and environmental, social, and relational
demands (Khetawat & Steele, 2023). In this context, the Swiss Cheese Model of Social Cues
suggests that several social cues may play a crucial role in determining an one’s capacity to

to friends’ messages (De Groote & Van Ouytsel, 2022). Individuals shape their behavior to
create impressions that lead to peer acceptance, social status, and validation of a positive self-
image (Bell, 2019). Not surprisingly, then, one’s social status and susceptibility to
inclusion/rejection have been linked with increased stress responses to relational stressors
(Estévez et al., 2014). Additionally, normative perceptions of social media demands, like
constant accessibility, have been shown to explain both smartphone misuse (Vanden Abeele,
et al., 2022) and its effect on well-being (Nick et al., 2022). Moreover, dynamics within friend
groups may accentuate this perception of the need for constant availability and reciprocity.
Within the platforms itself, apparent social cues that can increase feelings of digital stress are
the number of messages and push notifications (Steele et al., 2020). The Swiss Cheese Model
of Social Cues also theorizes potential protective (i.e. resilience) factors. Within the context of
digital stress, such factors include digital disconnection – limiting the number of notifications
received (Vanden Abeele et al., 2022) – and having close connections with family and friends.
The latter have been shown to act as buffers against negative life events (e.g., Telzer et al.,
2023), although their role in online stressful situations remains unexplored.
When investigating digital stress in adolescents, it is crucial for research to consider
their social network position, including acceptance/rejection, social connections, and
normative perceptions. Individuals less attuned to this social information, coupled with
stronger offline connections, may feel less socially obligated for constant online availability,
potentially reducing susceptibility to digital stress. This suggests a promising direction for
future research on understanding and mitigating this phenomenon among adolescents. Lastly,
the social cues adolescents receive from platforms (e.g., high notifications or none when
disconnected) will also influence their experience of digital stress.
Positivity bias online. Social media platforms are teeming with positively biased
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 20
content. Specifically, users – and especially adolescents – strategically curate and select content
to present a carefully constructed positive self-image (Bell, 2019). A prime example of this
practice is the widespread use of image-enhancing filters, resulting in an abundance of
idealized pictures on social media. Exposure to such content might trigger social comparison
processes (Haferkamp & Krämer, 2011), often resulting in upward comparisons. These upward
comparisons can take two distinct paths. For individuals who strongly believe in their ability
to control personal outcomes, such comparisons can evoke self-improvement motivations.
Such individuals feel they can enhance themselves or avert potential failures, making upward
comparisons a source of inspiration rather than a threat (Haferkamp & Krämer, 2011). For
others, social comparison with this idealized content might trigger negative affect and self-
perceptions (e.g., de Vries & Kühne, 2015).
The Swiss Cheese Model of Social Cues suggests, then, that adolescents' engagement
in social media comparisons and their emotional responses hinge on specific cues. Notably,
research on idealized social media exposure highlights the influential role of likes and
comments as bandwagon cues, amplifying or diminishing the impact of posted content (Kim,
2021). Warranting theory (DeAndrea, 2014) further explains this, emphasizing that
information shared by others carries more weight than self-posted content, influencing
perceptions, such as social attractiveness (Antheunis & Schouten, 2011). Neurobiologically,
likes activate adolescent brain’s reward circuitry (Sherman et al., 2018). Quantifiable social
endorsement (e.g., likes on idealized images) thereby serves as a significant socialization cue.
Moreover, the Swiss Cheese Model of Social Cues offers insights into adolescents'
decisions to partake in positivity-biased behaviors themselves. Notably, perceptions of social
norms and the imagined audience play a role in various social media-related behaviors, such
as self-presentation (Zillich & Riesmeyer, 2021). Drawing on impression management theory
(Leary & Jongman-Sereno, 2017), individuals often choose to share images on social media
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 21
driven by a desire for impression management and the anticipation of positive feedback (Bell,
2019). Hence, it follows that those more sensitive to social feedback from friends and peers
may be more inclined to seek it online and engage in positivity-biased behaviors.
Conversely, the pursuit of authentic self-expression represents the opposite end of the
spectrum. Studies have linked making authentic self-presentations online to lower levels of
depressive symptoms (Wang et al., 2019). Authenticity correlates with personality traits like
extraversion, agreeableness, emotional stability, and self-regulation (Kreling et al., 2021), traits
often found in well-liked adolescents (Frederickson et al., 2012). Emotional intelligence and
regulation, associated with higher sociability in adolescents, are crucial components of social
media literacy (Schreurs & Vandenbosch, 2021). It could be argued that well-liked adolescents
are more likely to possess the emotional and cognitive skills to consider potential drawbacks
of engaging in positivity-biased online behaviors (i.e., being considered inauthentic).
Consequently, they might opt for authentic self-presentation. However, empirical studies are
necessary to validate and substantiate this reasoning.
In sum, adolescents' participation in the positivity bias and its effect on well-being may
yield different outcomes for different individuals. These outcomes hinge on a specific
combination of social cues within the platform, an individual's sensitivity to social information,
and their position within the peer network.
Situational social media use. The way adolescents use social media, whether with peers,
parents, or alone, significantly shapes their experiences and behaviors (Masur et al., 2022;
Vanden Abeele et al., 2022). When with peers, social media use can foster an environment
where adolescents are driven to seek social rewards and approval. Peer presence has been
linked to a reward-motivated state, leading to preferences for immediate rewards and increased
brain activation in reward valuation areas (e.g., O’Brien et al., 2011). Although unexplored,
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 22
peer presence might also influence social media-related choices by driving the desire for
immediate social rewards or enhancing the salience of social rewards within the social media
context. For example, adolescents might opt for image-enhancing filters or engage in risky
online behaviors (e.g., risky self-disclosure) to gain (immediate) social recognition or approval.
Parental involvement, especially the presence of a caregiver, can act as a form of social
buffering. Studies suggest that caregivers play a vital role in enhancing adolescents' cognitive
control, resulting in a reduction in risky behaviors in their presence (e.g., Telzer et al., 2023).
The influence of parental presence on adolescents' decision-making involves mechanisms like
scaffolding, reducing the rewarding aspect of risky behaviors, or promoting a balance between
reward and cognitive control systems that encourages safer choices. In a specific study, the
presence of a caregiver increased the rewarding nature of engaging in cognitive control (Telzer
et al., 2023). Investigating whether caregivers can trigger reward-related responses that boost
adolescents' motivation to regulate their behavior while using social media remains a
compelling avenue for future research.
Essentially, the way adolescents engage with social media, whether alone or with
peers/parents, activates distinct cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. Socializing with peers
may emphasize a focus on social rewards and conformity, influenced by neural sensitivity to
social cues. Conversely, parental involvement can promote responsible social media use and
serve as a protective factor against risky behaviors. These contextual factors should be
integrated into the comprehensive framework of the Swiss Cheese Model of Social Cues to
gain a thorough understanding of adolescents' social media use and its effects. Following this,
the model's final assumption, the Assumption of Situational/Contextual Effect, underscores the
crucial role of context, beyond specific situations, in shaping the overall impact of social media
on well-being. This effect takes into account how individuals' experiences and perceptions of
context, across various situations over time, contribute to well-being outcomes.

Implications and Directions for Future Research
The Swiss Cheese Model of Social Cues is built upon the acknowledgment of variability
in social media effects among users. We contend that comprehending the link between social
media use and well-being requires a thorough exploration of the broader social context
surrounding these interactions. The interconnected layers of social cues, spanning cues within
platforms, the social environment, and individual susceptibility, symbolize the spectrum from
risk to resilience factors. This spectrum, and consequently the variability, is illustrated in our
model by non-existent, smaller, or larger holes, proving crucial for grasping adolescents' social
media effects. Understanding the factors empowering them to navigate negative social media
experiences and gravitate towards positive influences is vital for comprehending how we can
encourage resilient social media use. We posit that our model is particularly apt for
understanding adolescent social media use, given their heightened sensitivity to social
information, making them more susceptible to social media effects, both positive and negative.
To assess the model and delve into the dynamic associations among social cues in the
context of social media use, we propose employing a diverse set of research methodologies.
Experimental designs allow to examine both causal and situational effects. Longitudinal and
diary studies offer insights into the endurance of hypothesized effects and their external
validity. Utilizing measurement burst designs, which combine diary and longitudinal
approaches, can illuminate how individuals with resilient social media use continue to enhance
their well-being and resilience in online interactions. Sociometric investigations are crucial for
exploring how adolescents' objectively measured social status influences their social media
use, and social network analyses can enrich our understanding of how social media use and
effects propagate within a peer network. To investigate whether social media use triggers brain
activation or if neurobiological sensitivities can mitigate examined social media effects, fMRI
designs are essential. Lastly, dyadic research involving parents could augment the ecological
SOCIAL CUES, SOCIAL MEDIA, ADOLESCENTS 24
validity of understanding the role of parents in the context of social media effects.
Conclusion
In summary, the Swiss Cheese Model of Social Cues presents a dynamic framework
for examining the complex interplay between social media use and well-being, especially in
the context of adolescents. Through its consideration of the multifaceted layers of social cues
within platforms, the social environment, and individual (neuro)susceptibility, this model
offers insights into the elements that foster resilient social media use. It paves the way for
comprehending and promoting the well-being of adolescents in the digital age, recognizing the
distinctive social context shaping their online experiences.
