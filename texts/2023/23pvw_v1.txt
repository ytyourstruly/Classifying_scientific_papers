FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 2
Abstract
Emerging research in social and affective neuroscience has implicated a role for affect and
motivation in performance-monitoring and cognitive control. No study, however, has
investigated whether facial electromyography (EMG) over the corrugator supercilii—a measure
associated with negative affect and the exertion of effort—is related to neural performance
monitoring. Here, we explored these potential relationships by simultaneously measuring the
error-related negativity (ERN), error positivity (Pe), and facial EMG over the corrugator
supercilii muscle during a punished, inhibitory control task. We found evidence for increased
facial EMG activity over the corrugator immediately following error responses, and this activity
was related to the Pe for both between- and within-subject analyses. These results are consistent
with the idea that early, avoidance-motivated processes are associated with performance
monitoring, and that such processes may also be related to orienting towards errors, the
emergence of error awareness, or both.

Performance monitoring features prominently in everyday life. Driving vehicles, operating
machinery, and controlling air traffic are just a few examples of situations where individuals
must continually monitor and adjust their behavior in order to avoid adverse consequences.
While research in the past two decades has dramatically advanced our understanding of the
cognitive and neural underpinnings of these control processes, emerging research has also begun
to describe the role of emotion, motivation, and peripheral nervous system activation in
performance monitoring (Inzlicht, Bartholow, & Hirsh, 2015). One recent study suggested that
error processing triggers changes in corrugator supercilii activity (Lindström et al., 2013), a
facial muscle associated with negative affect (Cacioppo, Petty, Losch, & Kim, 1986) and the
exertion of effort (van Boxtel & Jessurun, 1993). Here, we ask if these transient, error-related
increases in EMG activity over the corrugator supercilii are associated with the
neurophysiological and behavioural correlates of cognitive control.
Performance monitoring
Performance monitoring encompasses the physiological, psychological, and behavioral
processes that evaluate and respond to discrepancies and failures in goal-directed behavior
(Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter & Cohen, 2001). When dominant response tendencies conflict
with one’s goals, or produce substantial differences between anticipated and actual outcomes,
cognitive control is recruited to override, restrain, or inhibit those tendencies in current or
subsequent behavior (Botvinick et al., 2001; Holroyd & Coles, 2002; Carver & Scheier, 1990;
Miyake et al., 2000). This kind of control is present in both laboratory reaction-time tasks, such
as the Stroop task (Botvinick et al., 2001; Braver, 2012), and also during everyday self-
regulatory behavior, such as restraining one’s desire to eat unhealthy food (Nederkoorn et al.,
2010). Unsurprisingly, control has been shown to confer benefits in multiple real-life domains,
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 4
including health, academic performance, well-being, stress regulation, longevity, financial
stability, and relationship satisfaction (Baumeister, Heatherton, & Tice, 1994; Compton et al.,
2008; Duckworth & Seligman, 2005; Hirsch & Inzlicht, 2010; Moffitt et al., 2010).
To investigate the neural processes that support performance monitoring and cognitive
control on the order of milliseconds, research has focused on two event-related potentials (ERP)
that follow errors: the error-related negativity (ERN) and the error positivity (Pe). The ERN
presents as a sharp negative deflection in the response-locked ERP that occurs at fronto-central
sites approximately 50-100 ms after mistakes (Gehring, Goss, Coles, Meyer, & Donchin, 1993;
Falkenstein, Hohnsbein, Hoormann, & Blanke, 1990). Conversely, the Pe is a broader positive
deflection that occurs around 200-400 ms following errors over more parietal electrodes,
resembling a P300 or P3b response to an error (Leuthold & Sommer, 1999; Overbeek,
Nieuwenhuis, & Ridderinkhof, 2005). Converging evidence suggests that the ERN is generated
in caudal regions of the medial frontal cortex (Dehaene, Posner, & Tucker, 1994; van Veen &
Carter, 2002; Pourtois et al., 2010). Conversely, while activity originating from this area is also
thought to contribute to the Pe (Van Veen & Carter, 2002; Herrmann et al., 2004; van Boxtel,
van der Molen, & Jennings, 2005), researchers have expressed caution over localizing this
broadly distributed component to a single source (e.g., Ridderinkhof, Ramautar & Wijnen,
2009).
While both the ERN and Pe have become well established in the ERP literature, the precise
functional significance of these components remains unclear. For example, the ERN has been
accounted for by a number of computational theories proposing that it reflects conflict-
monitoring (Yeung, Botvinick, & Cohen, 2004), reinforcement-learning (Holroyd & Coles,
2002), or a calculation of error-likelihood (Brown & Braver, 2005).
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 5
Additionally, in line with suggestions that neural performance monitoring and affective
processes are only minimally decomposable (Inzlicht et al., 2015; Koban & Pourtois, 2014;
Shackman et al., 2011), recent proposals have also suggested that the ERN represents the
affective or motivational significance of errors (Aarts, De Houwer & Pourtois, 2013; Proudfit,
Inzlicht & Mennin, 2013). Indeed, the ERN is larger in anxious psychopathologies (Weinberg,
Riesel & Hajcak, 2012), increases as a function of motivational traits associated with greater
sensitivity to aversive stimuli (Nash, Inzlicht & McGregor, 2012), and predicts faster
categorizations of negatively valenced words than positively valenced ones following errors
(Aarts, De Houwer, & Pourtois, 2013). Conversely, the ERN is smaller when established
regulators of emotion, such as alcohol consumption (Bartholow, Henry, Lust, Saults, & Wood,
2012), cognitive reappraisal (Hobson, Saunders, Al-Khindi & Inzlicht, 2014), and the
misattribution of arousal (Inzlicht & Al-Khindi, 2012) attenuate affective processing during task
performance. These findings imply that early performance monitoring processes—as represented
by the ERN—at least partially reflect the negative valence of erroneous actions (Aarts et al.,
2013; Inzlicht et al., 2015).
While the Pe has been subjected to less direct empirical investigation than the ERN, the
component has been related to several aspects of error monitoring, including error awareness,
behavioral adjustments, and the affective processing of mistakes (Overbeek, Nieuwenhuis &
Ridderinkhof, 2005). As a number of studies have indicated that the Pe is reduced to errors that
are not consciously perceived (e.g., Nieuwenhuis et al. 2001; Endrass, Reuter & Kathmann,
2007; O’Connell et al., 2007; Steinhauser & Yeung, 2010), the role of the Pe as a marker of error
awareness remains the most consistently supported account of its functional significance
(Wessel, 2012). The Pe has also been compared to the P3b (Leuthold & Sommer, 1999), a
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 6
stimulus-locked component elicited by motivationally significant stimuli (cf. Nieuwenhuis,
Aston-Jones, & Cohen, 2005). As such, the Pe is larger to more salient mistakes (Leuthold &
Sommer, 1999), Pe amplitude is positively correlated with that of the P3 (Davies, Segalowitz,
Dywan & Pailing, 2001), and the Pe covaries with experimental manipulations that induce
parametric variation in the P3 (Ridderinkhof, Ramautar & Wijnen, 2009). Thus, converging
evidence suggests the Pe reflects the motivational significance of consciously perceived errors.
In addition to the ERN and Pe, error-related engagement of the autonomic nervous systems
has been observed, including heart-rate deceleration (Crone et al., 2003; Fiehler, Ullsperger,
Grigutsch, & von Cramon, 2004; van der Veen, Nieuwenhuis, Crone, & van der Molen, 2004),
pupil dilation (Wessel, Danielmeier, & Ullsperger, 2011), and increased skin conductance
(Hajcak, McDonald, & Simons, 2003; Critchley, Tang, Glaser, Butterworth, & Dolan, 2005).
These reactions are most commonly associated with arousal and orienting towards
motivationally relevant stimuli (Sokolov, 1963). In line with this suggestion, error-related
autonomic responses are reduced to unaware errors (O’Connell et al., 2007; O’Keeffe, Dockree,
& Robertson, 2004; Wessell, Danielmeier, & Ullsperger, 2011) and are positively correlated with
the amplitude of the Pe (Hajcak, McDonald, & Simons, 2003a). Thus, researchers have
suggested that error-related autonomic activity, among other sources of error-related information,
may be involved in processes that engender error awareness (Hajcak, McDonald, & Simons,
2003a; Ullsperger, Harsay, Wessel, & Ridderinkhof, 2010; Wessel, Danielmeier, & Ullsperger,
2011).
Corrugator Supercilii Reactivity
Most relevant to the current investigation, a recent EMG study has suggested that error-
related engagement of the corrugator supercilii muscle is increased within the first 100 ms
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 7
following errors (Lindström et al., 2013). These findings provide an interesting complement to
previous reports of error-related activity in the peripheral nervous system because the corrugator
has been consistently associated with the expression and experience of negative affect. For
example, facial EMG over the corrugator increases when individuals express anger and fear
(Burrows, 2008; Burrows, Waller, & Parr, 2009), when they experience pain (Prkachin, 1992),
and when they passively view aversive stimuli or unpleasant scenes (Cacioppo, et al., 1986;
Larsen, Norris, & Cacioppo, 2003; Lang, Greenwald, Bradley, & Hamm, 1993).
Researchers have also found that EMG responses over the corrugator are related to self-
reported effort during physical and mental tasks (van Boxtel & Jessurun, 1993; de Morree &
Marcora, 2010; Waterink & van Boxtel, 1994). The putative role of the corrugator both in
negative affect and the exertion of effort at first might seem hard to reconcile within a single
psychological theory. Recently, however, it has been postulated that mental effort is itself
aversive (Botvinick, 2007; Kool, McGuire, Rosen, & Botvinick, 2010; McGuire & Botvinick,
2010). This suggests that activity over the corrugator may represent different aspects of
avoidance motivation, to the extent that both negative emotion and effort are common to
behavior motivated by avoidance.
In the study by Lindström et al. (2013), increases in facial EMG over the corrugator were
correlated with the greater slowing of responses following errors (cf. Rabbitt & Rodgers, 1977),
putatively indicative of increased response caution after mistakes (Botvinick et al., 2001; but see
Notebaert et al., 2009). This finding provides preliminary evidence suggesting that error-related
corrugator activity may serve as a marker of performance monitoring. However, no study to date
has explicitly investigated the relationship between facial EMG activity over the corrugator and
neural performance monitoring. Thus, in the present study, we sought to do this by
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 8
simultaneously measuring facial EMG and error-related ERPs during a punished cognitive
control task.
Given the mounting evidence that negative affect, motivation, and peripheral arousal are
involved in neural performance-monitoring, we predicted that increased error-related EMG
activity over the corrugator (cEMG) would be associated with larger error-related ERPs. This
notion is supported by anatomical, physiological, and psychological studies of the medial frontal
cortex and of performance monitoring. For example, previous work suggests that the medial
frontal cortex innervates the corrugator supercilii through afferent connections with the facial
motor nucleus of the brain stem (Morecraft, Stilwell-Morecraft, & Rossing, 2004), and that
anterior mid-cingulate cortex may act as a hub that integrates information about pain, negative
reinforcement, and cognitive control demands to bias behavior away from undesirable outcomes
(Shackman et al., 2011).
It may be hypothesized that the ERN specifically will be associated with error-related
cEMG due to their temporal and functional similarities. More precisely, both the ERN and error-
related cEMG activity peak within 100 ms of error responses, and both are associated with
activity in the medial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, the ERN and cEMG share a common
association with both negative affect and the exertion of effort. For example, larger ERNs predict
faster reaction times when categorizing negatively valenced words immediately following errors,
but not positively valenced words (Aarts et al., 2013), and larger ERNs have been found when
task performance is motivated through incentives or punishments (e.g., Pailing & Segalowitz,
2004; Legault & Inzlicht, 2013; Riesel, Weinberg, Endrass, Kathmann & Hajcak, 2012). These
findings suggest that early performance-monitoring processes track the affective valence or
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 9
motivational significance of task-related actions. Consequently, error-related cEMG may reflect
these early processes.
It may also be the case that error-related cEMG is associated with the amplitude of the Pe.
Much like the Pe, cEMG following errors could signal the emergence of error awareness or
represent orienting towards errors. Further, if error awareness emerges as a result of the
accumulation of error-related information (Ullsperger et al., 2010), error-related cEMG could
reflect early affective or motivational processes that contribute to this compound error signal.
Thus, in either case, it could also be hypothesized that increased cEMG to errors—like other
error-related increases in peripheral activity—will correlate with larger Pe amplitudes.
Method
Participants
Seventy-two undergraduate students at the University of Toronto Scarborough
participated in return for course credits. All participants had normal or correct-to-normal vision
and provided informed consent. Four participants were excluded from all analyses due to either
equipment malfunction (1 participant) or software malfunction (4 participants). In total, 67
participants were included in the data (45 female; mean age 19.1, SD = 1.6).
Procedure
Electrophysiological data was measured via electroencephalography (EEG) and facial
EMG while participants completed a two-choice speeded inhibitory control task. In this task,
participants responded using keys on a DirectIN PCB keyboard (Empirisoft, New York, NY) in
response to two stimuli, the letters “M” and “W”. The presentation probability for each stimulus
was asymmetric, giving a correspondingly asymmetric response ratio of 80:20. This
manipulation was based on the standard Go/No-Go task (Simmonds, Pekar, & Mostofsky, 2008),
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 10
where the high probability target induces a pre-potent tendency to respond, which has to be
inhibited for low probability targets. Our task modifies the task demands of this manipulation by
requiring participants to make an alternative and infrequent response to low-probability stimuli,
rather than withholding a response on the “no-go” trial.
On each trial, participants were required to press the “Z” key when they saw the
frequent, “M” stimulus (low-conflict), and to press the “/” key when they saw the infrequent,
“W” stimulus (high-conflict). The low- and high-conflict stimuli were presented in a yellow or
purple font depending upon punishment condition (detailed below). Each trial began with a
fixation cross presented for 600ms, followed by either a low- or high-conflict stimulus that
remained on screen until the participant responded or until a maximum of 1500 ms had passed.
Responses were followed by 400ms of a blank screen before the fixation cross for the next trial
appeared, providing a total response to target interval of 1000 ms.
During the task, performance-contingent punishment varied in intensity between blocks.
A punishment manipulation was included in our task paradigm for several reasons: (1) to
increase variability in our data by offering circumstances that would produce different amounts
of negative affect, with the expectation that this would also vary cEMG accordingly (Lindström
et al., 2013); (2) to see if cEMG would be larger in response to a punishment paradigm that has
been shown to increase ERN amplitudes (Riesel et al., 2012); and (3) to increase the ecological
validity of our task, as failing to adequately monitor performance in real life can sometimes have
adverse consequences. For all blocks, participants had a 50% chance to be presented with a 3500
Hz pure tone after making a mistake. Tones were presented from desktop speakers located
approximately 3 feet in front of the participant. The intensity of the sound was manipulated
block-wise and within-participants, where the punished condition corresponded to a volume of
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 11
95 dB (roughly equivalent to a motorcycle engine at 5 meters) and the unpunished condition to a
volume of 20 dB (roughly equivalent to whispered conversation). The tone lasted 1000 ms and
was followed by an additional delay of 1500 ms, 500 ms longer than trials without a tone. This
punishment manipulation has been previously shown to alter both electrophysiological and
behavioral measures of performance monitoring (Riesel et al., 2012).
Participants first completed a practice block of 20 trials without punishment, and then
completed 12 normal blocks of 70 trials each (840 trials in total). Of these 12 blocks, 6 were
punished and 6 were unpunished. Participants alternated between punished and unpunished
blocks in sets of 3, such that after completing 3 consecutive blocks in one punishment condition,
they then completed 3 blocks of the other condition, repeating this process until all 12 blocks
were completed. Participants were informed whether the set would be punished or unpunished
prior to the onset of every block: “During this block you will sometimes be presented with
[LOUD/QUIET] sounds when you press the wrong key”). The color of the stimuli corresponded
with the punishment condition, in order to remind participants whether a current block was
punished or unpunished. Both the order of the conditions and the color of the stimuli in relation
to the punishment condition were counterbalanced across participants.
After the inhibitory control task, participants completed a demographics questionnaire
detailing their age, gender, and number of years speaking English, as well as a number of
personality questionnaires not analyzed for the present study.
Behavioral analyses
We measured choice error rate and reaction time (RT) on correct trials, with the
hypothesis that high-conflict trials would produce more error responses and slower reaction
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 12
times than low-conflict trials. These results ensure that our task paradigm provides an effective
manipulation of conflict level, i.e. that high-conflict trials initiate cognitive control processes.
Electrophysiological processing
Continuous EEG activity was measured over the cortical midline sites (Fz, FCz, Cz, CPz,
Pz, Oz) using 6 Ag/AgCl electrodes embedded in a stretch-Lycra cap (Electro-Cap International,
Eaton, OH). Vertical electro-oculography (VEOG) was recorded using a supra-to-sub-orbital
bipolar montage placed around the right eye. Continuous EMG activity over the left corrugator
supercilii muscle was recorded with two miniature EMG Ag/AgCl electrodes (Cacioppo et al.,
1986). Both EEG and EMG activity were amplified using an ANT Refa8 TMSi (Advanced
Neuro Technology, Enschede, The Netherlands) device. The continuous EEG signal was
grounded to the forehead and referenced online to the average of all electrodes.
Offline, the EEG signal was re-referenced to the average of the two bilaterally placed ear-
lobe electrodes. Of the two electrodes placed over the corrugator supercilii, the one placed more
laterally on the face served as a reference for the medial electrode (cf. Cacioppo, Tassinary, &
Berntson, 2007). The continuous EMG signal shared the same forehead ground as the continuous
EEG signal. Impedances were kept below 5 kΩ for all recordings. Recordings were digitized for
the first 19 participants at 512 Hz using Advanced Source Analysis (ASA) 4.7.11 software. The
sampling rate was increased to 1024Hz for the remaining 53 participants in order to obtain
greater temporal resolution for the EMG signal. Prior to filtering and analysis, the data for these
first 19 participants were subsequently up-sampled offline to 1024 Hz using a spline
We also measured post-error adjustments in choice error rates and reaction time; however, due to the large number
of participants whose data were excluded for not containing at least six usable post-error RT trials (40 within the
punished condition, and 23 within the unpunished condition), this data was not analyzed. Specifically, about 50% of
post-error trials were not usable because they immediately followed a punishment tone. Trials following a
punishment tone have timings that are unequal to those that do not follow a tone, and trial timings have been shown
to vary post-error slowing effects (Jentzsch & Dudschig, 2009). Further, the general effect of punishment on
behavior and physiology is confounded by the immediate effect of a punishment tone on a given trial, necessitating
the exclusion of trials that immediately follow punishment tones.

interpolation procedure in BrainVision Analyzer 2.0 (Brain Products GmbH, Gilching,
Germany).
Both EMG and EEG were corrected offline for VEOG artifacts (Gratton, Coles, &
Donchin, 1983). EEG data were then digitally filtered between 0.1 and 30 Hz (FFT implemented,
24 dB, zero phase-shift Butterworth filter). Automatic procedures were then used to reject EEG
artifacts according to the following criteria: voltages steps of more than 25 V between sample
points, a voltage difference of 150 V within 150 ms intervals, voltages above 100 V and
below -100 V, and a maximum voltage difference of less than 0.50 V within 100 ms intervals.
The raw EMG signal was filtered offline using a 28-500Hz IIR band pass and 60Hz notch filter,
and then smoothed and rectified using a moving average procedure with a time constant of 20ms
(Cacioppo, Tassinary, & Berntson, 2007). Artifact rejection for EMG precluded voltages above
100 V and below -100 V. For EEG, artifact intervals were rejected from individual channels
in each trial.
Epochs commenced 200 ms before the response, and lasted for 1200 ms. Data for these
epochs were averaged within participants independently as a function of trial type (correct and
error response) and punishment condition (punished and unpunished), producing four averages
for each participant. Prior to dividing averages into time bins, EMG data was standardized (i.e.,
z-transformed) across the entire averaged epoch (Schacht, Nigbur, & Sommer, 2009). EMG
averages were then divided into 100 ms time bins, and within-participant values below or
exceeding 3 standard deviations from the within-participant means of each time-bin were
removed to reduce the impact of outliers.
The ERN and the correct-related negativity (CRN) were each defined as the mean EEG
activity between 0 and 100 ms post-response at the fronto-central midline electrode (FCz) for
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 14
error and correct trials, respectively. The Pe and its equivalent correct-trial ERP were
operationalized as the mean amplitude 200 to 400 ms following the response at the posterior
electrode, Pz. Error- and correct-related facial EMG over the corrugator were divided into eight
100 ms time bins starting from 200 ms pre-response and ending at 600 ms post-response, which
encompasses the time-course of the ERN and Pe. The signals for EEG and EMG were baseline
corrected by subtracting the average voltage 200 ms to 100 ms before the response. In addition to
these traditional operationalization of ERPs and EMG, we also conducted analyses on their
corresponding difference waves, denoted as ΔERN (ERN minus CRN), ΔPe (error Pe minus
correct Pe, and ΔcEMG (error cEMG minus correct cEMG).
Statistical calculations involving error-related data were based on no fewer than five
artifact-free trials (Olvet & Hajcak, 2009). For ERP error data, eight participants in the punished
condition and one participant in the unpunished condition had their error data excluded for not
meeting this criterion. Additionally, three more participants had just their ERN data removed
from both punishment conditions due to intractably high artifact percentages for the FCz
electrode. For EMG error data, seven participants in the punished condition and six participants
in the unpunished condition had their error data excluded. The average number of errors for the
remaining ERP data included in the analyses was 19.15 (SD = 11.90, Range = 5 to 55), and
24.42 (SD = 13.66, Range = 5 to 71) for punished and unpunished conditions, respectively. For
EMG data, these averages were 19.40 (SD = 12.22, Range = 5 to 55) and 24.51 (SD = 13.67,
Range = 5 to 71) for the punished and unpunished conditions, respectively. No ERP or EMG
correct-related data within the punished or unpunished conditions were excluded.
In order to account for missing data in the distribution of certain variables (e.g. error
rate), multi-level models were calculated in SPSS (v22) for all primary analyses, and all main
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 15
and interaction effects were evaluated using Type III analyses of variance. The MIXED function
in SPSS was used with a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method for fitting. Model
construction was driven by parsimony, where models were aimed at addressing hypotheses
rather than to maximize explained variance. An unstructured correlations covariance matrix was
used to estimate a random intercept for each participant for all fixed effects. For a set of within-
participant median splits, we also calculated one-way, repeated measures ANOVAs with Type
III sums of squares using the GLM function in SPSS.

For all statistical calculations, effect sizes were denoted using either semi-partial R (R ;
Edwards, Muller, Wolfinger, Qaqish, & Schabenberger, 2008) or partial η ( 2
; Cohen, 1976). In
order to reduce the incidence of Type I error from multiple comparisons, tests for different
dependent variables were corrected using a False Discovery Rate procedure (Benjamini &
Hochberg, 1995; Benjamini & Yekutieli, 2001).
Results
Behavioral Data
We used factorial models to assess the effect of conflict-level (low- vs. high-conflict) and
punishment (unpunished vs. punished condition) on mean reaction time (RT) and choice error
rate. Effect coding denoted the levels of each of the categorical variables. For conflict-level, low-
conflict trials were = - 1 and high-conflict trials were = 1; for punishment, trials in the
unpunished condition were = -1 and trials in the punished condition were = 1. In order to reduce
the effect of outliers on behavioral data, all responses more than 3 standard deviations above or
below the mean for each participant across cells were excluded; however, this procedure did not
exclude any values from any of the behavioral data.
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 16
Mean RTs. Confirming that our manipulation of conflict level was successful,
participants responded more slowly on high-conflict trials (M = 427 ms, S.E. = 6) than on low-
conflict trials (M = 370 ms, S.E. = 6), (b = -54.49, S.E. = 3.6) F(1, 192) = 461.725, p < .001, R2
0.72. Conversely, neither the main effect of punishment nor the interaction between punishment
and conflict-level were significant, both Fs < 1 ps > .3, indicating that our punishment
manipulation did not influence mean RTs.
Choice error rates. Participants had significantly higher error rates for high-conflict trials
(M = 10.1%, S.E. = 0.5%) compared to low-conflict trials (M = 0.6%, S.E. = 0.5%), (b = -0.09,
S.E. = 0.01) F(1, 192) = 365.452, p > .001, R2 .66. further indicating that greater behavioral
= 0
interference occurred on high-conflict compared to low-conflict trials. As with the RT results, we
did not observe a significant main effect of punishment level or conflict-level by punishment
interaction, Fs < 2.5, ps > .16, on choice error rates.
In summary, although our paradigm was effective in manipulating conflict in terms of
RTs and error rates, these punishment results fail to replicate previous findings that punishment
reduces error rates and increases RTs on correct trials.
Psychophysiological data
We used factorial models to assess the effect of trial type (correct vs. error) and
punishment (unpunished vs. punished) on ERP amplitudes, and the effect of trial type,
punishment, and time (seven 100 ms time bins, from -100 pre-response to 600 ms post-response)
on facial EMG activity over the corrugator supercilii. Identical analyses were also performed for
difference waves, except in these models only punishment was included as a fixed factor.
Categorical variables were effect coded such that correct trials = -1 and error trials = 1, and trials
in the unpunished condition = -1 and trials in the punished condition = 1. Because difference
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 17
waves cannot not be calculated for participants with missing error data, the sample size for the
difference wave analyses were smaller than for traditional analyses: n = 60 for ΔERN, n = 65 for
ΔPe, and n = 63 for ΔcEMG.
ERN and ΔERN (0-100 ms). Error trials were associated with substantially more
negative amplitudes (M = -4.34 μV, S.E. = 0.5) compared to correct trials (M = 4.97 μV, S.E.
=0.5), indicating the presence of a robust ERN, (b = 9.23, S.E. = 0.71) F(1, 183.837) = 350.638,
effect of punishment, nor a punishment by trial type interaction, Fs < 1.6, ps > .20. In line with
our ERN results, ΔERN was less than zero, M = -9.27, S.E. = 0.73, 95% CI [-7.82, -10.72]), and
there was no significant effect of punishment, F < 1, p > .9.
Pe and ΔPe (200-400 ms). In the time-course of the Pe, error trials were associated with
substantially more positive amplitudes (M = 11.48 μV, S.E. = 0.56) compared to correct trials (M
=-2.40 μV, S.E. = 0.55) (b = -14.54, S.E. = 0.80) F(1, 193.054) = 613.174, p < .001, R2 = 0.76,
was not influenced by the punishment condition or punishment by trial type interaction, both Fs
< 1, ps > .3. In line with our Pe results, ΔPe was significantly more positive than zero (M =
13.95, S.E. = 0.84, 95% CI [12.27, 15.63]), and the effect of punishment was not significant, F =
3.636, p = .061.
cEMG and ΔcEMG. A single 2 x 2 x 7 within-subject analysis (trial type x punishment x
time, respectively) revealed a significant main effects of trial type, (b = 0.05, S.E. = 0.14) F(1,
1656.865) = 16.328, p < .001, such that cEMG was higher for errors (M = 0.01 μV, S.E. = 0.03)
than for correct responses (M = -0.14 μV, S.E. = 0.03). There was also a significant main effect
of time, F(6, 1635.524) = 17.165, p < .001, such that cEMG was higher for earlier time bins
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 18
1, p = .938. There was also a significant interaction between trial type and time, F(6, 1635.522) =
4.647, p < .001, but no significant interaction between punishment and time, nor a significant
three-way interaction between trial type, punishment, and time, both Fs < 1, ps > .8. Simple
effects analyses of the interaction between trial type and time revealed that three post-response
bins (0-300 ms) showed greater EMG activity for error trials than correct trials, all Fs > 9.5, all
error and correct trials for the -100-0 ms pre-response time bin, F(1, 183.782) = 2.440, p = .120,
and no significant differences for time bins after 300 ms, all Fs < 3, all ps > .2. For all bins in
which there was a significant effect of trial type, there was no effect of punishment or a
significant trial type by punishment interaction (all Fs < 1, all ps > .3).
In line with our cEMG results, ΔcEMG had a significant main effect of time, F(6,
749.967) = 6.024, p < .001, but no significant main effect of punishment, F < 1, p = .337, nor a
significant interaction between time and punishment , F < 1, p = .885. The means for the first
response time bin (M = 0.13, S.E. = 0.09, 95% CI [-0.06, 0.31]), nor any time bin after 300 ms,
was more or less than zero.
These results replicate previous findings that facial EMG over the corrugator increases
within 100 ms of errors (Lindström et al., 2013). Interestingly, unlike this prior investigation, our
results indicate that errors produce increased EMG activity compared to correct responses up to
300 ms after the response. However, consistent with our behavioral results, we did not find
robust effects of punishment on either error-related ERPs or cEMG, suggesting that our
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 19
punishment manipulation was not effective in altering either the behavioral or
psychophysiological correlates of control.
Between-Subjects Relationships between ERPs, behavior, and facial EMG
For brevity, we limited further analyses of cEMG data to the time bins where facial EMG
over the corrugator was significantly increased for errors compared to correct responses (i.e., 0-
100, 100-200, and 200-300 ms post-response). As our punishment condition did not significantly
influence any of our behavioral or physiological measures, we removed this factor from further
analyses.
As with our previous results, we used factorial models to assess the effect of trial type
(correct/error) on physiology, effect coding correct responses = -1 and error responses = 1. For
the ERN and cEMG, ERP amplitudes in the 0-100 ms bin were added to three models as a
predictor of each of the three 100 ms post-response cEMG bins, reflecting the shorter duration of
the ERN compared to cEMG. Conversely, for cEMG and the Pe, cEMG in the three 100 ms post-
response bins were added to three individual models as predictors of the Pe, reflecting the earlier
onset of cEMG (0-300 ms) compared to the Pe (200-400ms).
The ERN and cEMG. After correcting for multiple comparisons, there were no
significant effects of ERN amplitudes, nor any significant trial type by ERN amplitude
interactions, for any of the three 100 ms post-response bins, all Fs < 4.7, ps > .03, on cEMG.
Prior to correcting for multiple comparisons, there was a significant trial type and ERP interaction on cEMG
for the 100-200 ms bin, (b = 0.05, S.E. = 0.02) F(1, 221.891) = 4.626, p = .033 (adjusted p = 0.099). Simple
effects of this interaction revealed that for correct responses, ERP amplitudes were positively correlated with
cEMG, b = 0.04, S.E. = 0.02, t = 1.957, p = .052. Conversely, for error responses, ERP amplitudes were
negatively correlated with cEMG, but this relationship was not statistically significant, b = -0.01, S.E. = 0.02, t =
-0.850, p = .369. These findings suggest that cEMG may be positively correlated with the CRN, although the
effect was only marginally significant. Conversely, our results do not suggest that cEMG at 100-200 ms is
correlated with the ERN.

These results were similar for the ΔERN and the three 100 ms post-response ΔcEMG bins, all Fs
< 1, all ps > 0.3.
cEMG and the Pe. There was no significant main effect of cEMG, nor a significant trial
type and cEMG interaction for the 0-100 and 100-200 ms post-response bins on Pe amplitude
(all main effect and interactions, Fs < 2.9, ps > .09). There was also no significant main effect of
cEMG for the 200-300 ms post-response bin on Pe amplitude, F = 3.272, p = 0.072. However,
there was a significant trial type and cEMG interaction for this time bin, (b = -2.39, S.E. = 0.76)
cEMG was positively correlated with Pe amplitudes, and that this relationship was unique to
error responses (b = 1.98, S.E. = 0.67, t = 2.971, p = .003) and not correct ones (b = -0.414, S.E.
= 0.47, t = -0.882, p = .379). These results show that ERP amplitudes were positively correlated
with cEMG between 200 and 300 ms, and that this relationship was unique to error trials, but not
to correct trials. This finding further illustrated in Fig 3, which depicts differences in Pe
amplitude between two groups of participants with the 20 highest and 20 lowest cEMG
responses in the 200-300 ms time bin.
The results for tests of the ΔcEMG and ΔPe were somewhat similar to those of the trial
type data. There was no significant effect of ΔcEMG on the ΔPe for either 0-100 ms post-
response bin (b = 1.02, S.E. = 0.59) F(1, 116.693) = 2.995, p = .086, or 200-300 ms post-
response bin (b = 0.92, S.E. = 0.66) F(1, 116.122) = 1.951, p = .165. However, there was a
significant effect for the 100-200 ms time-bin (b = 1.49, S.E. = 0.59) F(1, 115.113) = 6.290, p =
0.014, R2 = 0.05, showing that ΔERP amplitudes for this time bin were positively correlated with
cEMG.

cEMG from 100-300 ms and the Pe. As the 100-200 and 200-300 ms cEMG time bins
have close temporal proximity and because they both had the same positive direction in their
relationship to amplitudes of the ΔPe, we chose to conduct two additional tests by averaging
these two bins together for both the cEMG and ΔcEMG data to see if their relationships with the
Pe and ΔPe would hold, respectively. These tests were primarily conducted to address the
discrepancy in time between the trial type and difference wave data, as cEMG was related to the
Pe at 200-300 ms, but ΔcEMG was related to the ΔPe at 100-200 ms.
For the trial type data, and after correcting for multiple comparisons, there was no
significant main effect of this 100-300 ms cEMG time bin on the Pe, (b = 2.77, S.E. = 0.93) F(1,
235.752) = 3.978, p = 0.047, adjusted p = 0.108, R2 = 0.02. However, there was a significant
interaction between trial type and cEMG for this time bin (b = -3.32, S.E. = 1.04) F (1, 216.223)
= 10.174, p = .002, R2 = 0.04. Simple effects of this interaction again revealed that there was a
significant positive relationship between cEMG and the Pe, and that this relationship was
specific to error responses (b = 2.77, S.E. = 0.93, t = 2.983, p = .003) and not correct ones (b = -
0.55, S.E. = 0.55, t = -0.989, p = .324). An analysis of the ΔcEMG and the ΔPe for this combined
100-300 ms time bin produced similar results as the trial type data. There was a significant effect
of ΔcEMG on the ΔPe (b = 1.80, S.E. = 0.75) F(1, 115.008) = 5.795, p = .018, R2 = 0.05, such
that the increasing difference between correct and error responses in cEMG was positively
correlated with the increasing difference between correct and error responses for the Pe.
Together, these results suggest that cEMG is positively correlated with Pe amplitudes
between 100-300 ms after the response, and that this relationship is unique to error responses and
not correct responses.

cEMG and Behavior. Based on previous physiological results, we used factorial models
to assess effects of trial type and EMG on our behavioral measures of control. We limited this
analysis to the only behavioral measure of control for which we had usable data: the effect of
cEMG on choice error rate. For choice error rate, we effect coded low-conflict trials as = -1 and
high-conflict trials as = 1.
There were no main effects of cEMG on choice error rate, nor any trial type and cEMG
interactions, for any of the three post-response time-bins of interest, Fs < 1.2, ps > .3. These
results show that while our task was successful in generating error-related cEMG activity, this
activity was not related to choice error rate.
Within-Subject Relationships between ERPs and facial EMG
In the models described previously, we found evidence that cEMG on error trials was
related to the Pe for between-subjects analyses. These analyses found that participants with
larger error-related cEMG had larger Pe amplitudes. In a second set of analyses, we aimed to
confirm these results within-subjects: that is, within a single participant, are error trials with
larger cEMG responses accompanied by larger Pe amplitudes, and smaller cEMG responses by
smaller Pe amplitudes? Our between-subjects analyses also failed to find a relationship between
ERN amplitudes and cEMG on error trials. As within-subject analyses can detect effects at the
level of the individual that fail to emerge at the level of the group, we elected to also analyze the
relationship between the ERN and cEMG on error trials.
In order to do this, we conducted additional within-participant median splits of ERP
amplitudes based on low and high cEMG activity for the first three post-response time bins
where we found significant main effects of trial type (0-100, 100-200, and 200-300 ms). First,
we exported the cEMG activity and ERP amplitudes for each individual error trial within a
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 23
participant, such that each trial contained an ERP amplitude matched with a normalized cEMG
response. Next, we calculated median cEMG responses for each participant, and then split ERP
amplitudes for each participant into two equal sized sets of trials determined by whether a trial’s
cEMG response was below or above the participant’s median. Trials within each set were then
averaged together, producing two means for each participant: mean ERP amplitude for low
cEMG responses, and mean ERP amplitude for high cEMG responses. These means were then
compared with three repeated-measure ANOVAs for each ERP (i.e., the ERN and the Pe). Only
participants with at least 14 errors (7 for low cEMG, and 7 for high cEMG) and without missing
ERP data from the previous between-subject tests were included in these analyses (n = 49 for the
Pe; n = 48 for the ERN). As in previous analyses, results were corrected for Type I error using a
False Discovery Rate procedure (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995).
The ERN and cEMG. For the 0-100 ms time bin, we found that ERN amplitudes on error
trials with high cEMG (M = -3.09 μV, S.E. = 0.84) were significantly more negative than ERN
amplitudes on error trials with low cEMG (M = -1.40 μV, S.E. = 0.87), F(1,47) = 4.736, p =
0.035, = 0.09. However, this result was no longer significant after correcting for multiple
comparisons, adjusted p = 0.105. For the 100-200 and 200-300 ms time bins, ERN amplitudes
for low and high cEMG were not significantly different from one another, both Fs < 1, both ps >
0.600. Thus, while we found evidence that error trials with higher cEMG were associated with
more negative ERN amplitudes, this result should be interpreted with caution, as it was not
robust after correction for multiple comparisons.
cEMG and the Pe. For the 0-100 time bin, Pe amplitudes for low and high cEMG were
not significantly different from one another, F(1, 48) = 2.753, p = 0.104. For the 100-200 ms
time bin, Pe amplitudes on error trials with high cEMG (M = 12.49 μV, S.E. = 1.04) were
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 24
significantly more positive than Pe amplitudes on error trials with low cEMG (M = 11.08 μV,
S.E. = 1.09), F(1, 48) = 6.195, p = 0.016, = 0.11. For the 200-300 ms time bin, Pe amplitudes
for low and high cEMG were not significantly different from one another, F(1,48) = 3.264, p =
0.077. Confirming the between-subject analyses, these findings provide evidence that cEMG on
error trials is positively associated with Pe amplitudes. More specifically, they suggest that on
average, error trials with higher cEMG are concomitant with higher Pe amplitudes, and error
trials with lower cEMG coincide with lower Pe amplitudes.
Discussion
The present study explored the relationships between error-related ERPs, facial EMG
over the corrugator supercilii, and cognitive control. Our primary objectives were to replicate
previous findings that cEMG is sensitive to performance errors, and to relate this peripheral
error-monitoring signal to neural performance monitoring and inhibitory control. Replicating one
previous study (Lindström et al., 2013), we found that facial EMG activity over the corrugator
supercilii was increased to erroneous relative to correct actions within 100 ms of the response.
Interestingly, we also found that this difference extended as far as 300 ms after the response, and
that time bins of cEMG between 100 and 300 ms after an error were positively related to Pe
amplitudes for both between- and within-subject analyses. In contrast to this robust relationship
between cEMG and the Pe, however, cEMG on error trials was not significantly related to ERN
amplitudes in between-subjects analyses, and was no longer significant after correcting for
multiple comparisons in within-subject analyses. cEMG was also not related to the behavioral
implementation of control.
While previous work has investigated relationships between error-related engagement of
the peripheral nervous system (e.g., skin conductance, heart-rate deceleration) and neural
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 25
monitoring, this is the first study to precisely explore the relationship between error-related
cEMG and ERPs. Our findings show that error-related cEMG is related to the Pe, and may not be
consistently related to the ERN. As cEMG has been associated with both negative emotions
(Cacioppo, Petty, Losch, & Kim, 1986) and the exertion of effort (van Boxtel & Jessurun, 1993),
our results are consistent with the notion that performance-monitoring processes are linked to the
affective or motivational significance of errors (Aarts et al., 2013; Inzlicht et al., 2015),
particularly within the time course of the Pe. However, as cEMG has been associated with a
variety of processes involving affect and motivation, the functional significance of error-related
cEMG remains unclear. Further research will be necessary to determine what cEMG represents
during error responses, and what its relationships to the ERN and Pe may signify.
Nevertheless, our findings are consistent with other research indicating that error-related
engagement of the peripheral nervous system—including skin conductance, heart-rate
deceleration, and pupil dilation—covaries with the amplitude of the Pe, but not necessarily the
ERN (Hajcak, MacDonald, & Simons, 2003a; O’Connell et al., 2007; Wessel, Danielmeier, &
Ullsperger, 2011). Importantly, error-related autonomic arousal has been interpreted as an
orienting response to the error (Hajcak et al., 2003). Consequently, the positive association
between Pe and cEMG suggests that facial EMG over the corrugator may signify orienting
towards motivationally important events (i.e., mistakes), or represent processes that contribute to
such orienting. These explanations are supported by proposals that the Pe shares functional and
topographical similarities with the P3b, a stimulus-locked ERP sensitive to the motivational
relevance of stimuli (see Leuthold & Sommer, 1999; Overbeek et al., 2005; Ridderinkhof et al.,
2009).
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 26
Given the common finding that Pe amplitude is associated with error awareness (e.g.
Nieuwenhuis et al., 2001; Endrass et al., 2005, 2007), our findings also suggest an interesting
possibility: processes reflected in corrugator activity might be involved in or represent the
generation of error awareness. Recently, Ullsperger et al. (2010) suggested that the subjective
awareness of an error might arise when the accumulation of error-related signals becomes
sufficiently strong to differentiate erroneous actions from noise. Evidence contributing to this
compound error-signal may consist of a wide variety of pre- and post-response information,
including stimulus features, response conflict, an efference copy, proprioception, interoception,
and sensory input. Subsequent accrual of this information may be reflected in amplitude of the
Pe (Wessel, Danielmeier, & Ullsperger, 2011). Thus, processes reflected by cEMG may serve as
yet another source of information that accumulates during the generation of error awareness.
However, as the latency of cEMG and the Pe are overlapping, it is equally probable that error-
related cEMG may reflect the emergence of attentional orienting or error awareness, rather than
contributing to its generation.
Although we found that error-related cEMG was associated with the amplitude of the ERN
for within-subject analyses, this finding was no longer significant after correcting for multiple
comparisons. Further, we found no relationship between the ERN and error-related cEMG for
our between-subjects analyses. This is an unexpected result, given the extensive research linking
activity in the medial frontal cortex and cognitive control with negative affect (see Shackman et
al. 2011), and consistent findings that error-related cEMG activity and the ERN share temporal
and functional similarities (see also Lindstrom et al., 2013). However, as the ERN peaks rapidly
after the response, its amplitude may be based on relatively limited sources of information, such
as response conflict arising from ongoing stimulus evaluation (Yeung et al., 2004) or reward
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 27
prediction error signals (Holroyd & Coles, 2002). Conversely, the Pe occurs later and is
potentially associated with a wider array of error-related signals, such as proprioceptive feedback
and sensory action effects (Ullsperger et al., 2010). Thus, the relative richness of error-related
information reflected in the Pe might explain why this component, rather than the ERN, has a
stronger and more consistent association with error-related cEMG.
Limitations and future directions
The present findings should be interpreted in light of a number of limitations. First, our
results regarding cEMG and error-related ERPs are correlational in nature. Therefore, we cannot
determine whether processes that support both cEMG and ERPs are causally related to one
another, or if confounding factors may account for their relationship. Secondly, the inefficacy of
our punishment manipulation in varying any metric of control in our study suggests that our
punishment was not powerful enough to provide a substantive source of avoidance motivation.
However, the effect of punishment on physiology and behavior has not always been consistent,
and studies using similar punishment methodologies have found punishment effects (e.g., Riesel
et al., 2012; Saunders, Milyavskaya & Inzlicht, in press) while others have not (e.g., Stürmer,
Nigbur, Schacht, & Sommer, 2011). Thirdly, our data do not allow for a straightforward
characterization of the functional significance of cEMG, which has previously been associated
with a variety of non-isomorphic processes related to avoidance motivation. Future studies
should attempt to disentangle the cognitive, affective, and motivational factors that may give rise
to error-related cEMG, such as through a combination of affective priming (see Aarts, De
Houwer, & Pourtois, 2013) and self-reported effort.
Importantly, however, our findings are generative, providing several new directions for
future research. What kinds of cognitive, motivational, and affective manipulations influence the
FACIAL EMG RELATES TO PE 28
magnitude of error-related facial EMG over the corrugator? Does cEMG covary with individual
differences related to neural performance-monitoring? For example, increased ERN amplitudes
are commonly reported in anxious psychopathologies (Weinberg et al., 2012). Future research
could use error-related cEMG as a further measure of altered performance monitoring in clinical
samples. Finally, in light of the observed association between error-related cEMG and Pe
amplitude, it may be the case that the processes cEMG represents are involved in orienting to
error responses, the emergence of error awareness, or both. Thus, future research could
determine if error-related cEMG—akin to the Pe—is reduced to unaware errors.
Conclusions
Taken together, our study confirms the presence of error-related facial EMG activity over
the corrugator supercilii during an inhibitory control task, and shows that this activity correlates
with the Pe, an error-related potential most commonly associated with error awareness. These
findings further suggest that error-monitoring processes are concomitant with rapid and transient
changes in affect or motivation, and that these processes may be involved in orienting towards
errors or in the emergence of error awareness.
