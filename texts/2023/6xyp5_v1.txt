USE OF CONTROL VARIABLES 2
16 Abstract
17 Control variables are frequently employed when assumed relations between constructs of
18 interest should be corrected for extraneous effects. However, researchers rarely justify the
19 inclusion of control variables, and the statistical impacts receive only little attention. This paper
20 provides critical reflections on the commonly carefree use of control variables. Furthermore,
21 two statistical methods to evaluate the influence of control variables on latent properties in
22 structural equation models were probed. To this end, a simulation study was conducted in which
23 the strengths of associations between the substantial constructs as well as the effects of the
24 control variable were manipulated. Adding a control variable did not affect the model-implied
25 covariance structure, but the parameter estimates of the structural equation model. In
26 conclusion, better theoretical and statistical considerations are required when dealing with
27 control variables and parameters should be compared between models with and without control
28 variables.

30 Unfortunately, everything is under control: A plea for stronger statistical considerations
31 about the use of control variables
32 Social scientists frequently assume that their predictors, moderators, mediators, and
33 outcomes alike are contaminated by certain extraneous variables that potentially serve as
34 alternative explanations for the relations under scrutiny. Shared variances with these
35 extraneous variables (i.e., assumed control variables) are sought to be eliminated to adjust the
36 tested relationships among the substantial variables for erroneous contents not immediately
37 pertinent to the subject. Researchers thereby frequently control for gender, age, or socio-
38 economic status or psychological variables in a narrower sense such as social desirability or
39 negative affectivity (Spector & Brannick, 2011).
40 Pointing to the very nature of the utilized control variable in a particular analysis,
41 however, researchers should ensure at the conceptual level that the control variable is not in
42 fact an antecedent or a consequence of one of the substantial variables (i.e., has a causal
43 relation with the constructs of interest as opposed to being a mere covariate). For instance,
44 researchers might control the relations among supervisors’ performance appraisals of their
45 employees for the supervisor’s liking for a person. At the conceptual level, it is reasonable to
46 assume that a supervisor’s liking is not just a covariate but a consequence of good work
47 performance (cf. Spector & Brannick, 2011). Similarly, one might argue that employees’
48 work performance improves, given a positive relationship with their supervisor. In both cases,
49 the relations among performance appraisals were distorted if they were controlled for liking,
50 yielding ambiguous associations and false conclusions (Carlson & Wu, 2012). Consistent
51 with this, Simmons et al. (2011) argued that almost every hypothesized relation could be
52 proved by arbitrarily controlling for certain variables (see also Becker, 2005). A different
53 string of research pointed to the perils of partialling (Hoyle et al., 2023). That is, eliminating
54 shared portions of variance among constructs can jeopardize accurate interpretations of the
55 links between the “refined” predictors and criteria. More precisely, meaningful contents from
USE OF CONTROL VARIABLES 4
56 the substantial variables are assumed to be removed by adjusting them for other predictors.
57 Therefore, aspects of a particular variable needed for the full expression of this construct also
58 covered by the control variable(s) would be eliminated (see also Carlson & Wu, 2012). For
59 instance, if a researcher were to investigate the relationship between depressive symptoms and
60 eating behaviors and controls for negative affect, the conceptual content of the assumed
61 predictor (depressive symptoms) and the criterion (eating behavior) would be substantially
62 curtailed by the inclusion of the control variable (negative affectivity; Iqbal & Dar, 2015; Van
63 Strien et al., 1985). In this case, the substantial variable cannot be meaningfully interpreted.
64 Addressing the lack of proper methods to evaluate the impact of control variables in
65 structural equation models (Becker, 2005), two methods are presented that assists scholars in
66 this regard. The first comprises an exploratory comparison of the model-implied variance-
67 covariance matrices of the assumed structural model with and without the control variable(s).
68 To this end, the basic discrepancy function from latent models as well as pertinent model fit
69 indices were adopted. Second, the effects of including a control variable are evaluated in
70 terms of model parameters that are frequently subject to hypothesis testing of substantial
71 relations (e.g., loadings, factor covariances and paths; Becker, 2005; Simmons et al., 2011;
72 Spector & Brannick, 2011). To demonstrate and evaluate both methods, the relations among
73 independent, dependent, and control variables are manipulated using a simulation study.
74 Derivation of the Discrepancy Function
75 The first method explores whether including one or more control variable(s) has any
76 effects on the variance-covariance structure of the remaining indicators. To this end, the
77 difference between the model-implied variance-covariance matrices of the structural equation
78 models with and without the control variable(s) is computed by means of an adopted form of
79 the discrepancy function from structural equation modeling. In its original form, it deals with
80 the comparison of a model-implied variance-covariance matrix and an empirical variance-
81 covariance matrix (see Equation 1).

82 In this equation, 𝛴3𝜃4 denotes the variance-covariance matrix proposed by the latent

85 distributed index with k * (k + 1)/2 degrees of freedom by multiplying it with the number of
86 observations minus one (i.e., n – 1). If the observed χ2-value exceeds the critical χ2-value with
87 the same degrees of freedom, one concludes that S differs substantially from 𝛴3𝜃4. Applying
88 these considerations to the comparison of models with and without control variables, and in
89 keeping with the general logic of the discrepancy function (Jöreskog et al., 2016), I adopted

94 in structural equation modeling, the value of the discrepancy function is multiplied by (n – 1)
95 to obtain a χ2-index. The number of degrees of freedom is a function of the number of
96 indicators with df = k * (k + 1). This expression reflects the total number of estimated
97 variances and non-redundant covariances in both matrices. Both the derivation of the
98 discrepancy function and the approach to quantifying the degrees of freedom are similar to
99 Jennrich’s (1970) method for the comparison of correlation matrices. However, in latent
100 modeling, computations of variance-covariance matrices are preferred over correlation
101 matrices (e.g., to obtain valid standard errors or to enable multiple-group analyses; Jöreskog
102 et al., 2016). Due to reliance on correlation versus variance-covariance matrices, the
103 difference between the degrees of freedom of the present approach and those in Jennrich’s
104 approach equals the number of elements on the diagonal of the matrices (i.e., indicator
USE OF CONTROL VARIABLES 6
105 variances). Since standardized variances are restricted to 1, they would be omitted in
106 Jennrich’s method, but I argue that implied item variances provide additional information in
107 terms of the intended comparisons.
108 Derivation of Adopted Versions of Common Descriptive Fit Indices
109 Due to the conceptual proximity to discrepancies sensu structural equation modeling,
110 another advantage of the present approach refers to descriptive fit indices that supplement the
111 above significance test: Since the χ2-index suggests differences between the matrices quite
112 easily if the sample size is sufficiently large, reports of χ2-indices are usually supplemented by
113 descriptive indices (Jöreskog et al., 2016). Common indices are the Root Mean Square Error
114 of Approximation (RMSEA) and the Square Root Mean Residual (SRMR). Put simply, the
115 RMSEA quantifies the relative discrepancy between the proposed and the observed variance-
116 covariance matrices. In the present approach, the adopted χ2-index reflecting the discrepancy
117 between the models with and without the control variable(s) is used. The SRMR quantifies the
118 average deviation between the elements of the model-implied and observed correlation
119 matrices. Before the average deviation is calculated, differences between the non-redundant
120 entries of the model-implied correlation matrices are squared. This procedure was adopted to
121 the difference between the elements of the model-implied variance-covariance matrices of
122 models with and without one or more control variable(s).
123 Side-by-Side Comparison of Parameter Profiles
124 Another, rather simple way to evaluate the influence of control variables refers to
125 immediate comparisons of the parameter estimates of interest (Simmons et al., 2011; Spector
126 & Brannick, 2011). In structural equation models, those could be loadings, item residuals,
127 factor variances, covariances among factors, and assumed paths between factors. To this end,
128 standardized estimates of the parameters both competing models have in common are
129 compared to enable users to evaluate whether the same conclusions emerge from models with
130 or without one or more control variable(s).

131 Method
132 Data Generation and Analytical Strategy
133 A simulation study with structural equation models was conducted. The strengths of
134 associations among the independent, dependent, and control variables (βs = .20, .40, and .60),
135 whereby — for the sake of simplicity — equal effects of the control variable onto the
136 independent and dependent variables were specified. Within each condition, 1,000 datasets
137 with 500 observations each were simulated. Given that the magnitude of loadings does not
138 affect the relations between latent factors (Hodson, 2021), all loadings (four per factor) were
139 restricted to λ = .60. The simulations were carried out with the R package lavaan (version
140 0.6–16; Rosseel, 2012).
141 The influence of including the control variable was evaluated in two ways, both
142 implemented in the R package latcontrol (Blötner, 2023). First, employing the approach from
143 Equation 2, I evaluated the differences between the variance-covariance matrices of the
144 models belonging to the same condition with and without control variables. The evaluation
145 was based on the modified χ2-index, the modified RMSEA, and the modified SRMR. Second,
146 I compared the parameter profiles of the structural equation models belonging to the same
147 condition with and without the control variables.

151 trials each. As can be seen, differences in the variance-covariance matrices of the models with
152 and without the control variable were negligible because the χ2-indices and descriptive fit
153 indices alike support the null hypothesis according to which the model-implied variance-
154 covariance matrices do not differ. Thus, the approach lacks sensitivity to detect biases due to
155 the inclusion of a control variable.

157 Side-by-Side Comparisons of the Parameter Profiles
159 equation models with and without control variables across conditions. As can be seen, item
160 loadings and residuals remained essentially identical, irrespective of the inclusion and the
161 strength of the control variable. On the other hand, the residual variances of the independent
162 and dependent variables were higher in the models without the control variable. This,
163 however, is reasonable because — as per model specification — the control variable is
164 intended to explain unique variance of the dependent variable. In the model without a control
165 variable, the independent variable is an exogenous variable, that is, its variance is not
166 accounted for by other variables. Thus, all of its variance remains unexplained. In contrast,
167 models with a control variable treat the independent variable as an endogenous variable for
168 which a specific ratio of variance is accounted for by other variables in the model (i.e., the
169 control variable). Likewise, as per model specification, the control variable is supposed to
170 explain variance not yet accounted for by the independent variable (Jöreskog et al., 2016).
171 Thus, it is unsurprising to observe differences in the ratios of explained variance for the
172 independent and dependent variables.

174 Discussion
175 Spector and Brannick (2011) argued that a plethora of studies did not provide
176 sufficient theoretical reasoning for the control variables included in the manifest or latent
177 models tested. Simmons et al. (2011) pinpointed this lack of theoretical elaboration as one
178 case for the replication crisis of psychology. Given a lack of appropriate statistical techniques
179 to evaluate the role(s) of control variables, the present study aimed to present straightforward
180 statistical tools in this regard and investigated their performance in simulation studies.
181 Evaluation of the Findings
182 It turned out that the more complex method — dealing with potential effects of the
183 control variable(s) on the covariance structure of the remaining items — was not eligible to
184 detect biasing effects. Given that the magnitude of the χ2-index (and the corresponding p-
185 value) depends on the sample size, an extreme number of observations would be required to
186 find significant differences. For instance, due to the number of shared elements in the model-
187 implied variance-covariance matrices of the models with and without the control variable, the
188 χ2-test utilized in this study had 72 degrees of freedom. The critical χ2-value for 72 degrees of
189 freedom, given an α-level of 5%, is 92.81. To obtain such a high χ2-value in the simulated
190 condition with the highest discrepancy between the models with and without the control
191 variable from the simulations (i.e., a weak link between independent and dependent variables
192 but strong influence of the control variable; χ2 = 0.44), 105,253 observations would be
193 required. The estimators of structural equation models are sought to minimize the difference
194 between the variance-covariance matrix observed in the sample at hand and the model-
195 implied variance-covariance matrix. Thus, it stands to reason that the poor performance of the
196 above discrepancy function can be attributed to the fact that it is applied to optimized
197 parameters. Furthermore, the other approach demonstrated in this study — the comparison of
198 the parameter profiles — also suggested that virtually no effects of the inclusion of a control
199 variable can be observed at the item-level (i.e., item loadings and item residuals).
USE OF CONTROL VARIABLES 13
200 Apart from non-existing item-level differences, the side-by-side comparison of the
201 parameter profiles was suitable for identifying interpretative differences between the models
202 with and without a control variable at the factor level. The “causal” effects of the independent
203 variable on the dependent variable exhibited considerable differences. The analyses suggested
204 that the stronger the effect of the control variable, the higher the difference between the path
205 coefficients of the relation between the independent and the dependent variable observed in
206 the models with and without the control variable. Since the differences between the path
207 coefficients of the relations between independent and dependent variables were negligible
208 (Δ = -.036), a weak control variable (i.e., β = .20) had no substantial impact on the
max
209 interpretations of the observed link between independent and dependent variables. This was
210 true, irrespective of the magnitude of the link between the independent and dependent
212 in the first place. Therefore, and in line with the principle of parsimony, it would be
213 reasonable to exclude it (Carlson & Wu, 2012). On the other hand, the magnitude and —
214 correspondingly — the interpretation of the relation between the independent and dependent
215 variables differs substantially between models with and without a control variable if the
216 control variable elicits a strong effect onto both (i.e., β = .60). Note in this regard that such
217 strong effects indicate that the control variable shares large amounts of variance with the
218 constructs of genuine interest. In the sense of the perils of partialing (Hoyle et al., 2023), this
219 raises doubts about the interpretative value of the relation between the dependent and
220 independent variables once being refined for the control variable because it stands to reason
221 that both constructs are strongly constrained in terms of their respective conceptual breadth.
222 Thus, by adjusting both substantial constructs for overlaps with a highly similar construct
223 (i.e., the control variable), the full expression of the substantial concepts is no longer
224 warranted. Applying these considerations to the above fictitious example, the interpretation of
225 the link between depression and eating behavior would be unclear if this relation was adjusted
USE OF CONTROL VARIABLES 14
226 for negative affectivity because negative affectivity is a meaningful determinant of depression
227 and eating behavior alike (Iqbal & Dar, 2015; Van Strien et al., 1985). In this sense, the scores
228 ostensibly reflecting depression and eating behaviors no longer contain all pertinent elements
229 if affect-related variance is removed from them.
230 Limitations
231 This study was not without limitations. First, this research relied on simulated data for
232 which the configurations of path coefficients and loadings were “artificial”. Real data might
233 be less optimal in these regards as loading patterns might be more heterogeneous and path
234 coefficients might be dispersed across a wider range than that employed in the simulations.
235 However, the idea behind the specified path coefficients was to contrast the effects across
236 settings that are as realistic as possible because — in my point of view — researchers would
237 treat effect sizes below β = .20 as small and those above β = .60 as extremely high. Thus, the
238 selected effect sizes were sought to reflect the usual range observable for typical applications.
239 Second, the present simulation study dealt with the most basic scenario that can be observed
240 in structural equation modeling as it considered only a single predictor, a single criterion, and
241 a single control variable. Simultaneously, I postulated isomorphic effects of the control
242 variable onto both substantial variables. This being said, structural equation models computed
243 in psychological research are usually more complex and it is unlikely that a control variable
244 elicits equal effects on independent and dependent variables. Given the multitude of possible
245 patterns of specifications, however, applying any structure that would have been more
246 complex (i.e., more predictors, control variables, and/or criteria) would have resulted in
247 arbitrary decisions and more complex interpretations in terms of the underlying question.
248 Third, imposing different effects of the control variables on the independent vis-à-vis the
249 dependent variable was beyond the scope of this research. Even without conducting respective
250 analyses, however, it is disadvantageous to include a control variable that is substantially
251 related to the dependent variable(s) but unrelated to the independent variable(s) as this poses a
USE OF CONTROL VARIABLES 15
252 suppression effect and compromises statistical power. Since the R script to conduct the
254 research to expand on the present settings and test other patterns of parameters. Fourth, the
255 derivation of the adopted discrepancy function introduced in this research was exploratory
256 and the side-by-side comparison of parameter profiles was comparatively easy in terms of
257 methodological rigor. It is conceivable that even more information about the roles of control
258 variables can be obtained with more sophisticated methods that have yet to be developed.
259 Implications
260 The rationale of this study was to evaluate the general effect of control variables on
261 model parameters of structural equation models but also to raise researchers’ awareness of the
262 caveats of control variables. This is not to say that control variables are per se “bad” but a call
263 to provide more profound considerations about the potential causal roles of proposed control
264 variables. Researchers should also put more emphasis on potentially distorted interpretations
265 if an independent variable is refined for one or more control variable(s), that is, what does the
267 provides an overview of exemplary “true” relations between what researchers posited as
268 independent, dependent, and control variables. In this sense, it is the researchers’ job to rule
269 out alternative model configurations’ plausibility. Given that the present simulation did not
270 mention particular theoretical concepts, content-related considerations about the interplays of
271 the variables were not possible. One way to better acknowledge the presumed control variable
273 would be able to model individual differences instead of eliminating them. Such analyses
274 arguably pose stronger contributions to scientific progress than efforts to “clean” conceptual
275 links for ostensibly extraneous influences. If in a specific case, it is reasonable to adjust
276 relationships for one or more variable(s), methods such as propensity score matching should
277 be used to balance rather than eliminate extraneous variance.

279 Conclusion
280 It is always reasonable to compare the results of structural equation models with and
281 without control variables to each other to identify potential suppression, consider the perils of
282 partialing, and evaluate whether the control variable alters the parameter patterns (Hoyle et
283 al., 2023; Simmons et al., 2011; Spector & Brannick, 2011). If the comparison reveals that
284 there are no major interpretative differences, and considering the principle of parsimony, it
285 stands to reason to omit the control variable (Carlson & Wu, 2012).
