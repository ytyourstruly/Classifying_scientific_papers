A history of the
Institute for Advanced Studies (IHS)
in Vienna based on its key figures
Andreas Huber, Thomas König*
Abstract
The IHS was established in Austria with funds from an American foundation. With the intention to introduce
modern empirical social and economic sciences to Austria (and Central Europe). After initial resistance, the institute
was embraced by national political elites: in addition to providing postgraduate education for emerging scholars, it
also functioned as a scientific think tank conducting applied, policy-relevant empirical research. This text provides a
narrative account of the Institute's development and transformation, relying on specific metrics systematically evaluated
from accessible sources, particularly annual budgets and staff composition. It portrays an organization consistently
challenged by diverse expectations and grappling with the organizational and strategic limitations of deriving concrete
objectives from this.
Introduction
The formal establishment of the Institute for Advanced Studies (IHS) in Vienna in 1963 explicitly aimed
at bringing Austria up to international standards in economics and social sciences. It was, thereby,
also intended to provide an impetus for the modernization of the country. With the support of the
Ford Foundation, as well as Austrian institutions (Austrian Central Bank, Federal Government, City
of Vienna), the institute established itself as a renowned postgraduate training center within a few
years. It remains the largest social science research center outside of universities in Austria. From
its beginning, the institute was strongly internationally oriented, attracting academic elites from
around the world to Vienna. The two-year postgraduate program, spanning from 1965 to 2015,
saw the participation of over 1,000 scholars and was a pioneering initiative in Europe.
Aspects of the history of the IHS have already been described in detail. There are accounts on the
conflict-ridden founding years (Fleck 2000; Kramer 2002; König 2012a); in addition, there are

analyses based on specific, valuable archival collections (Raith 2001; Fleck 2017a). At the institute,
research on the state of social sciences in Austria (Knorr et al. 1974; Knorr, Haller, and Zilian 1981;
Müller 1988; 2008) inevitably also revolved around the institute, with a spin-off project offering an
early analysis of the organizational structure of the IHS (Marin 1978).
An anthology from the early 1990s with various contributions commemorating the institute's 30th
anniversary may no longer align entirely with current research standards (Felderer 1993). Other
(later) texts partially fulfil the aim of providing an overview but predominantly concentrate on what
is now commonly referred to as the “governance” of the institute, focusing on specific periods
(Fleck 2017b; 2018). Only in exceptional cases is the role of the IHS attempted to be contextualized
from a more epistemological-historical perspective (König 2012b).1
Despite the numerous inspections mentioned above, two gaps persist. The first gap is the absence
of a comprehensive historical account of the IHS's history, and the second is the lack of an analysis
of what this institute has actually achieved in terms of knowledge transfer and knowledge
production over its approximately 60 years of existence.
While the present text can be viewed as an early outcome of a project aiming to address the second
question,2 it primarily focuses on the first gap — the comprehensive portrayal of the institute's
history as an organization. It provides a narrative of the development and transformation of the
IHS over the course of the first five decades of its existence. It is to be acknowledged as an obvious
limitation of the present text, that without having analyzed and factored in the actual output in
terms of research as well as graduates, such a comprehensive account cannot be deemed complete.
Instead, this text brings together several time series that highlight continuities and ruptures in the
institute's history.
Why has an institute that is relatively small and can only claim to have achieved a certain supra-
regional significance in academic terms within the German-speaking region attracted so much
attention to date? It is likely that the incentive to delve into the institute's history is rooted not only
in its academic standing but also in the high expectations and aspirations associated with the
institute from the very beginning. In fact, this is a consistent motif along which the history of the
institute can be written, as we will conclude towards the end of this text.
The following text is structured as follows: first, we briefly discuss the time series underlying this
text, which we have compiled from institutional sources. These time series only gain significance
when considered in conjunction with, on the one hand, the analysis of historical sources— in the
1 It is worth noting, as a footnote, that the attention devoted to the history of the IHS in research suggests that the
institute itself can be described as a “model case”, as proposed by Monika Krause—namely, a “privileged material
research object” to which a certain significance is attributed due to repeated analyses from various perspectives (Krause
2021).

case of this text specifically, the minutes of the meetings of the board of trustees (Kuratorium)—
and, on the other hand, the science policy context in Austria. Through such interpretation, these
time series enable the identification and empirically plausible understanding of continuities as well
as breaks in the institute's history.
We identify breaks in the form of definable periods in the history of the institute, which we explain
in more detail in the following sections. The presentation of these periods constitutes the main
part of the text. Finally, and as an outlook, we look at the continuities that can be identified at the
IHS over the period under investigation. In doing so, we differentiate between continuities
concerning the organizational structure, continuities in terms of research, and continuities
regarding the position of the IHS within the Austrian research landscape. We will conclude by
discussing some of the findings.
Time series of the institute's history
Previous accounts of the history of the IHS have either focused on the analysis of sources
(especially minutes of the board meetings, the reception of the IHS in the media, the directors'
policies, etc.) or on the scientific output achieved at the institute. In other words, they are based
on archival and data sources commonly used in organizational history, and undoubtedly of crucial
importance to historical research. However, given that the research object is a specific organization
and its development over several decades in a specific (and changing) context, these sources may
not necessarily contribute to gaining a comprehensive understanding of the stability or dynamics
of this organization, and of the underlying patterns or changes over the time. In contrast, our
analysis is based on time series, i.e., historical data that is (largely) complete for the period from the
founding of the institute in 1963 to the present.
Four dimensions of the organization’s development are of interest; fortunately, the underlying time
series can be reconstructed from available archival records. Those time series are the institute's
budget (derived from annual financial statements); the headcount of the staff; the visiting
professors (both extracted from annual reports); and the members of the board of trustees and of
the institute’s management. The present text focuses on a narrative representation of the institute's
development and transformation; it does not provide an in-depth analysis or a reflection on these
time series.3 Nevertheless, a brief overview of each of the four-time series is provided at the outset
in order to capture the key insights from their development.
3 For a more detailed examination of these time series, we refer to a separate working paper explicitly prepared for this
purpose, which is currently in the process of publication (König and Huber, forthcoming). Many insights in this regard
have been drawn from the literature on the "historical turn" discussed in organization studies (Rowlinson, Hassard,
and Decker 2014; Godfrey et al. 2016; Decker, Hassard, and Rowlinson 2021).
In terms of funding, it is evident that the IHS has had a fairly stable funding base over the six
decades. The basic subsidy accounts for the largest share for most of this period (except for the
brief phase from 1970 to 1973). It was early on financed from the Austrian federal budget, which
was doubled in the early 1970s and then remained at a largely consistent level until the end of the
study period. This can also be attributed to gradual withdrawal of other (public) funders, leaving
the Ministry of Science and the National Bank as the main subsidizers; with only the entry of the
Ministry of Finance as a funder representing a shift in the opposite direction. However, this new
source only compensates for the reduction of funds by the Ministry of Science during that time
(until 2011 when the Ministry of Finance definitively takes on the role of the primary financier).
The overall increase in annual budgets from the early 1990s is almost exclusively explained by the
influx of third-party funds in the form of projects, which became a steady source and accounted
for nearly 45 percent—a notably high proportion.
In terms of staff, the absolute number of academic staff and their distribution across various status
groups (scholars, assistants, department heads) can be taken into account. For the most part the
number of staff at the institute remained largely the same, apart from a staff cut shortly after the
institute’s founding, which was quickly compensated for. From the 1990s onwards, the staff size
increases significantly. In terms of departmental allocation, the three core departments – Sociology,
Political Science, and Economics – remained largely equal in size until the end of the 1980s. It was
from the growth in the 1990s onwards that Economics gained a disciplinary dominance,
experiencing a significant growth in personnel. The department of Sociology also grew, but only
moderately; the department of Political Science remained on the same level as before.
The institute had a strong international focus and invited scientific elites from all over the world
to come to Vienna as guest professors. During the founding phase, the institute's management was
able to attract renowned scholars such as the political scientist Jean Blondel, the political scientist
and later US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the sociologist Talcott Parsons and the economist
Martin Shubik for a stay of one or more months in Vienna. The prominence of the visiting
professors is evident in the number of (later) Nobel Prize winners. Of the 92 economists who have
received the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences since its introduction in 1969, 15
have taught at the IHS.4 The highest density of later Nobel Laureates was recorded in the founding
phase. In the 1960s (1963/64 to 1969/70), the institute had six later Nobel Laureates, in the 1970s
just as many, including Kenneth J. Arrow and John R. Hicks, both laureates in 1972. The count
dropped to zero in the 1980s but rebounded in the 1990s with another six visits from future Nobel
4 Four others had been invited. James Tobin was listed in both the budget and the curriculum for the academic year
1967/68, but ultimately did not appear to have come to Vienna. Similarly, Robert Aumann, Ragnar Frisch and Richard
Stone had also received an invitation for the 1963/64 academic year.
laureates, including Ben Bernanke in June 1995, who last received the price in 2022 (jointly with
two other economists).5 After the turn of the millennium, there was a renewed decline. Also: those
who had already received the Nobel Prize no longer came to the institute. For example, Arrow,
who taught at Harvard University, had been at the IHS just a year before receiving the prize, with
the institute incurring a cost of around 50,000 Schilling for his visiting professorship.6
Legally, the institute was set up as an association (“Verein”). It was headed by a board of trustees as
the institute's most important decision-making body; for a considerable period, its powers included
even staff appointments. The board consisted of an average of around 15 individuals from politics,
academia, business, and the banking sector. On the one hand, the status of the various members
of the Board of Trustees within their respective sector (from Austrian politics, for example, the
Federal Chancellor alongside members of the Parliament, while from the private sector, CEOs
from banks as well as industrials) is of interest. On the other hand, it is also relevant to which
extent the mentioned sectors were represented in the oversight body. Interestingly, though not
surprisingly, there is a general tendency that the members of the board of trustees progressively
included fewer political top decision-makers.
The board convened for the first time on January 31, 1963, a day officially recognized as the
founding date of the IHS. The initial seven members of the board were: President of the Austrian
National Bank (ÖNB) Reinhard Kamitz, the Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs Bruno Kreisky,
the Minister of Education Heinrich Drimmel, the Mayor of Vienna Franz Jonas, the former
President of Bennington College in Vermont Frederick Burkhardt, the President of the Association
of Austrian Industrialists Franz Josef Mayer-Gunthof and the lawyer and constitutional judge
Wilhelm Rosenzweig. In the academic years 1968/69 and 1969/70, the number of members
doubled, primarily due to the inclusion of general managers from the banking sector and university
professors. This was intended to give the IHS more clout and secure its financial basis. However,
the number of members of the Board of Trustees remained relatively stable in the following
decades and only fell to less than ten in 2016.
1979/80 was a turning point in that only one member of the OeNB was represented on the Board
of Trustees, compared to three previously (this only changed again under Director Felderer).
Politics, business and banking continued to be represented on the Board of Trustees by their
highest-ranking representatives, including the Federal Chancellor and the Federal Minister of
Science in the 1970s. However, from the academic year 1994/95 onwards, neither the Federal

Minister of Education nor the Federal Minister of Science was present on the board. A decade
later, active federal politicians had also disappeared from the board of trustees.
Over the six decades of the institute’s history, a total of 78 men and women were elected to the
Board of Trustees. 32 of them, (more than 40 per cent) were professionally involved full-time in
politics, either before or during their tenure at the IHS. The proportion of former politicians never
fell below one-third in any year, and from the academic years 1979/80 to 1993/94, it was
consistently at least 60 percent. Almost half of these 32 politicians were affiliated with the two
major (former) political parties, ÖVP (Austrian People's Party) and SPÖ (Social Democratic Party
of Austria) – indicating that, for many years, appointments were made in line with the proportional
representation system (“Proporz”).
Periodization of the institute's history
If we superimpose the different time series from over 50 years of the institute's history, notable
changes and discontinuities occurred at closely spaced or even overlapping points in time (see
phases. The (longer) phases in between these transitions, on the other hand, can be assumed to
have been relatively stable periods. Each of these periods can be further characterized: from 1958
to 1970, a period of protracted establishment; from 1970 to 1979, a period of upswing; followed,
from 1980 to 1991, by a period of stagnation; from 1991 to 2000, a renewed consolidation; from
2000 to 2011, a period of boom years. This was followed (relatively abruptly) by a phase of
disorientation, which ended, at least formally, in 2015 with a fundamental reform of the
organization and statutes (simultaneously ending the period under consideration).

Protracted establishment (1958 to 1970)
In the initial years of setting up and formally constituting the institute – with its official founding
on January 31, 1963 – were characterized by a consecutive number of interruptions. The first
director, Slawtscho Sagoroff, had to leave the IHS prematurely in 1965 due to internal disputes
with the board, prompting economist Oskar Morgenstern to assume leadership. Simultaneously,
the IHS experienced a significant decline in personnel – a consequence of the somewhat chaotic
staff recruitment during the founding period. Issues such as assistants working full-time at the
University of Vienna, earning a second salary without being physically present, were just one of
several concerning occurrences. The institute's income also experienced a crisis, decreasing sharply
in 1965/66. In 1967/68, the Ford Foundation’s subsidies for the IHS were running out; eventually,
the Republic of Austria, through the Ministry of Education, stepped in as a financier.
By the end of the 1960s, the situation gradually began to stabilize. The staff numbers recovered
from 1967/68 onward, reaching the mid-1960s level again by the fall of 1969. Simultaneously, the
institute's Board of Trustees managed to improve the financial situation. The budget still
experienced significant fluctuations from 1967/68 to 1970/71. Consequently, the late 1960s
(1967/68 to 1969/70) marked something akin to a second founding phase. Unlike in 1965, this
period did not end with the removal of a director; this time, the stage was set for what – from an
external perspective – could be considered a successful further development.
Upswing (1971 to 1979)
By 1970/71, the Board of Trustees had expanded, growing from seven to ten members. It included
representatives from the highest echelon of government: Hertha Firnberg, the first female Minister
of Science in Austria (the ministry had been established in 1970), and Bruno Kreisky, former
Minister of Foreign Affairs and now Federal Chancellor. Additionally – and for the first time - two
general directors of Austrian banks played a role in steering the institute's development: Franz
Ockermüller from the Österreichische Länderbank and Josef Taus from the Girozentrale and Bank der
österreichischen Sparkassen. From the academic year 1971/72 onward, the institute’s financial situation
stabilized, and subsidies remained constant in real terms for the following two decades.
The 1970s also brought some media attention. With the help of an IBM computer system, the IHS
not only laid the foundation for comprehensive empirical social science research in Austria but also
enabled election predictions. From the 1970 national elections onwards, director Gerhart
Bruckmann presented these predictions to a million-strong audience on the Austrian Broadcasting
Corporation (ORF). During the Bruckmann era (1968–1973), two new departments were
established at the institute: Business Administration/Operations Research and Mathematical
Methods and Computer Techniques (MMC). The latter was a consolidation of the data center with
the Department of Formal Sciences, with the label being the only truly new aspect.
Students aiming for postgraduate education at the IHS could now choose from five departments
when applying, each with its own department heads, assistants, and guest professors responsible
for their education. Following Bruckmann, former IHS scholar Gerhard Schwödiauer headed the
institute for six years. At the level of the directorate at least, a degree of stability had been
established, contrasting with the initial five years after the official founding when there had been
four directors in office.
Stagnation (1980 bis 1991)
in revenues and personnel were not evident, and the internal structure of the IHS with its five
departments remained unchanged. The only noticeable change was a brief decline in the number
of scholars, but fluctuations in the number of trainees, all of whom had to pass an entrance
examination, were not unusual in the history of the institute. However, changes can be observed
in the governing bodies and among the visiting professors: by the end of the 1970s (1979/80),
members of the Österreichische Nationalbank largely withdrew from the Board of Trustees. OeNB
President Stephan Koren remained, serving as the president of IHS Board of Trustees. When he
passed away in January 1988, 25 years after the institute's founding, someone from outside the
Central Bank assumed the presidency for the first time: Heinrich Neisser, then still the Federal
Minister for Federalism and Administrative Reform in the Federal Chancellery from the ÖVP.
The decline in visiting professorships from the USA and Canada can be interpreted as a sign of
stagnation, if not even as in indication of loss of significance. In the 1960s still a unique feature of
the IHS (with sometimes 50 percent of guest professors coming from overseas), now often only a
fifth or fewer academics was coming from universities and other institutions in North America.
This development was not gaining any publicity, of course; rather, the premature departure of
systems scientist Anatol Rapoport attracted attention. However, this was probably not an issue for
the public, but rather the premature departure of systems scientist Anatol Rapoport. Against his
will, the Board of Trustees removed him from the position of director on December 31, 1983, and
appointed former State Secretary in the Ministry of Finance Hans Seidel as his successor.8 Against
his will, the Board of Trustees dismissed Rapaport as director on 31 December 1983 and appointed
the former State Secretary in the Ministry of Finance, Hans Seidel, as his successor. The fact that

many suspected a set-up behind this was probably not unfounded (Fleck 2018, 1004-5). In the
following years, Seidel focused on managing the status quo.
Consolidation (1992 bis 2000)
After about a decade of stagnation and disorientation, the early 1990s witnessed the most
significant upheavals in the institute's history to date. These changes were closely linked to the new
director, Professor of Economics Bernhard Felderer, who, incidentally, moved from the University
of Cologne to the Ruhr-University Bochum in the year of his appointment. Under Felderer's
leadership, changes occurred in all the dimensions discussed here. Subsidies, but especially project
funds, increased significantly in the second year of his directorship, mainly due to increased
acquisition activities. The academic year 1992/93 marked the end of the Department of Business
Administration/Operations Research; it was followed by MMC at the end of 1997/98. Instead, the
Applied Economics program was introduced. Students of this program joined as a new group of
trainees alongside scholars. Although the Applied Economics program was short-lived (until
1996/97), its introduction set the direction for the years to come: a focus on economics.
While the three core departments of Economics, Political Science, and Sociology had been roughly
equally staffed for decades, from the 1990s onward, the pendulum swung in favor of Economics.
The group of academic staff began growing in number from the academic year 1992/93 onwards.
Two years later, the number of scholars was also increased, although they were, by now, far less
well compensated in comparison to the early years of the institute. Starting from 1998/99,
economics was equipped with a second department (“Applied Economics”, while the other one
was now called internally “Teaching Economics”). It was probably not a coincidence that, from
1994/95 onwards, the National Bank once again engaged with three representatives in the Board
of Trustees. For the first time in the institute's history, notably, no government member belonged
to the Board of Trustees.
The increasing share of third-party funds in subsidies – from one-third in 1996/97 to 40 percent
in 1998/99 – benefited not only the economics departments. With some delay, namely in the
second half of the 1990s, Sociology also found its way into the new research environment and was
able to significantly increase its personnel. Political Science, on the other hand, stagnated, meaning
that the number of staff remained constant, but clearly losing significance in the context of the
other departments. Increasingly, it led a niche existence at the IHS; maybe this was related to
changing priorities at that time, but the departures of personnel in the academic years 2002/03 and
2007/08 likely also contributed to this.
Boom Years (2000-2011)
A closer look at the individual dimensions reveals growth that seemed almost unstoppable beyond
the turn of the millennium. From the mid-2000s onwards, the number of scholars increased one
last time, but interns, trainees, and student assistants were also increasingly used at the institute –
especially, it can be assumed, in the context of project funding – to support its operations. Did the
IHS overreach itself with this continuous expansion, particularly in the area of research staff? The
ceiling for income was reached in the 2009/10 academic year, and first cracks in the teaching realm
had already become apparent before then. While the IHS had been able to continue the tradition
of attracting high-ranking university professors from North America to the institute in the 1990s,
this changed in the early 21st century. By the academic year of 2004/05 at the latest, it was
increasingly scientists from Austrian institutions who were responsible for giving the majority of
courses in the postgraduate programs.
IHS employees also played an increasingly important role in this regard. For the academic year
2011/12, the decline of the training function is clearly evident from the graphs; the postgraduate
programs were then formally discontinued in 2015. This year also marks the peak of the dominance
of economists: no less than 71 percent of the scientific staff (excluding assistants and trainees) were
affiliated with economics – a record that would not be surpassed thereafter.
Disorientation (2011 bis 2015)
The most recent phase in the history of the Institute for Advanced Studies was marked by
controversies regarding conflicting expectations for the institute, leading to several years of
disorientation. Christian Keuschnigg, who succeeded Felderer, resigned early after just over two
years. Under financial pressure, he had proposed a new direction for the institute. Keuschnigg's
plan was to eliminate the Sociology and Political Science departments and continue the institute as
a research institute focused on economics. Theoretically, this aligned with the development of the
previous two decades under Felderer; yet it faced internal opposition within the institute and did
not convince the majority of the members of the Board of Trustees.
In 2015 and 2016, interim directors were appointed (first Sigurd Höllinger, then Thomas
Czypionka). Eventually, a comprehensive realignment of the institute took place, albeit different
from Keuschnigg's initial proposal. The postgraduate training programs (“scholarship program”)
was discontinued, and the discipline-oriented departments were replaced by interdisciplinary,
theme-oriented research groups. In mid-2016, Martin Kocher, coming from the University of
Munich, took over the newly structured institute. He also introduced behavioral economics as a
new research area. Kocher assumed leadership of the institute in its new building after the old
location had to be finally abandoned, with the building dilapidated.
The changes were not yet complete: a new association statute was adopted, and the Board of
Trustees was fully reconstituted—entirely new for the first time in its history: No member from
the academic year 2012/13 remained in office by the end of 2016. Heinrich Neisser resigned as
president and was succeeded by former federal and European politician Franz Fischler; Caspar
Einem assumed the position of vice president. For the first time since 1967/68, the Board of
Trustees had fewer than ten members. Bankers and university professors lost prominence, while
the proportion of high-ranking civil servants increased. Yet even after almost 60 years, the
percentage of board members with a political background remained high—in 2016, it was just
under half.
Continuities
Organizations can be characterized by the way they distinguish themselves from the
environment—both from other organizations and from the fuzzy area that the literature terms
non-organizational.9 For a research organization, two dimensions are relevant in this regard: one is
related to content (i.e., what is done or intended to be done at the institute in scientific terms), and
the other to organizational structure. We would like to end this article by briefly noting the most
significant continuities in relation to these two dimensions. In doing so, we also raise questions
that must remain the subject of further, in-depth analysis of the institute's history.
In terms of content, the following continuities can be identified: the Institute's consistent focus on
postgraduate training and the disciplinary orientation of its research and academic activities. With
regard to training, it can be stated that, with considerable certainty, this was the essential defining
and distinguishing feature of the institute vis-à-vis the academic environment (specifically, those
Austrian universities where economics and social sciences were taught). This is true especially for
the first three decades of its history. The relevance of the training function decreased in the later
decades, but it likely retained a high identity-forming effect for the institute. In any case, it remained
a continuous element until it was quite abruptly terminated in 2015. At the same time, it should be
noted that there were drafts for the reorientation and strategic development of the institute in the
management protocols, starting from the 1960s, which require a separate diachronic analysis.
The disciplinary orientation of the Institute's research and academic activities also represents
continuity. It cannot be definitively stated to what extent this was due to the training program.
Since the internal structure itself was organized into disciplinary departments, it is likely that
resource conflicts at the institute might have been expressed in the form of epistemic disputes,
which, in turn, may not have been conducive to internal cohesion.10 Conversely, it is noteworthy
that – during the period of investigation - there were apparently very few attempts or initiatives to
establish a common, conceptual, or theoretical foundation that went beyond the disciplines. Were
there any such initiatives or attempts at all, in what context, and how were they received?
In terms of the organizational structure of the IHS, at least three continuities can be highlighted:
the disciplinary internal structure of the institute, the role of the director as the institute's leader,
and the changing composition of the Board of Trustees. In fact, while the institute has occasionally
9 This general statement can be asserted not only for functionalist approaches, but also for systemic (Simon 2015), and
neo-institutionalist (Brunsson 2020) approaches in organizational theory.
10 The longevity of such attributions should be noted in passing. To this day, it is customary at the Institute to speak
of “the” economists, “the” sociologists and “the” political scientists, even though the corresponding departments have
not existed for more than seven years now.
expanded or dissolved departments within its internal structure during the investigation period, no
alternative was considered. It was apparently taken for granted that the discipline-oriented
departments, along with the library service (and later the IT department), would fulfil the central
tasks of the IHS. The question to be clarified here is to what extent the opening and closing of
departments was based on fundamental strategic considerations – and to what extent it was perhaps
simply due to opportunity.
As far as the role of the director is concerned, there have been modifications in the distribution of
work (initially, it was a two-person team, and from 1984 onwards, it became a single leadership
position). However, the outstanding organizational significance of this leadership role has never
been altered. This certainly aligns with the organizational self-image of many scientific institutions
in general. What is notable about the IHS, however, is that there have been recurring multi-year
phases characterized by the search for a suitable leader - both in the 1960s, in the late 1980s and at
the end of our study period (from 2012 to 2016). It is no coincidence that the phases of a stable,
multi-year directorship have also become defining periods, but from an historical perspective, these
interim phases require an explanation: Why was it so challenging to fill this position with a person
considered suitable during these times?
One reason could have been the presence of numerous (and perhaps insufficiently specified)
expectations for this leadership position. This brings us to the third continuum, the Board of
Trustees, which, among other responsibilities, oversees the appointment of the director. Over the
period of investigation, we observe that the Board of Trustees is composed of high-profile
individuals from the Federal Republic, with changes occurring. Initially, it consisted mainly of top
politicians; later, bankers and industrialists were also involved. In recent decades, there is an
increasing presence of former politicians and senior civil servants. However, there are no
international figures on the Board of Trustee. It is noteworthy that the Board, as a group, undergoes
changes in size without apparent strategic considerations – as if immediate (perhaps even political)
reasons were sufficient. If this finding is reinforced by further source analysis, it once again points
to a certain weakness in the overall organizational structure of the institute.
Summary and Outlook
Reflecting on the role of the institute in the historical context of Austria, it becomes evident that it
held a prominent position in academic, political, and media contexts throughout the described
periods. This was true regardless of the actual scientific productivity of the research conducted at
the institute. How can this be explained? The desiderata formulated in the previous section not
only serve the purpose of guiding further historical analysis of the IHS but also provide insights
into the institute's role in the science policy context of the Second Federal Republic from the 1960s
onwards. It is not coincidental that during this period, science policy emerged as an independent
policy field.
The IHS was a (still early) attempt at establishing a non-university institute in Austria after 1945,
particularly notable in the context of the Second Republic.11 It can be characterized as an early, and
admittedly flawed, endeavor in scientific organizational founding within the then relatively limited
landscape of research institutions. This explains the initially prominent composition of the Board
of Trustees, as well as the procedural errors in organizational development: a politicized oversight
body that, perhaps as a result, was unable to provide the institute with a realistically implementable
mission; consequently, an unclear objective; and an apparently randomly formed internal structure,
at least not evident from the available sources. However, this only partially explains why the
institute perpetuated these errors and evolved as outlined above. It will be necessary to delve into
the dynamics that the organizational development brought about and how the changing discourse
in science policy influenced the institute.
As a result of the present depiction, a fundamental motive emerges for a historiography of the IHS.
The institute was (and remained) equally a projection surface for high (though often diffuse)
expectations and an organization that was overwhelmed with the tasks assigned to it. The former
implies that the institute was repeatedly the object of different (and sometimes contradictory)
academic and science policy expectations—and above all, it continued to be so. This affected
members of the Board of Trustees, influential figures from academic and political circles, as well
as staff members. The scientific goals of the institute were seldom explicitly formulated and even
less frequently the subject of strategic planning and implementation. As a result, it was often unclear
what “mission” (using the semantics of contemporary organizational development) the institute
actually had. At the same time, this ambiguity itself provided grounds for further projections.
Simultaneously, the actual organization of the IHS struggled in many phases of its existence because
it could not, at its own discretion, fulfill the – often only implicit - goals and tasks pursued by
different actors with the available resources. This sense of organizational overwhelm is objectively
understandable. To name just three of the most obvious poles that were consistently present within
the institute: Should the institute focus on teaching or research? Should it engage in applied research
or basic research? Should it concentrate on specific disciplines or operate in an interdisciplinary
manner? Each of these poles provided points of connection for creating new projection surfaces,
and (until 2015), no clear decision was made regarding where priorities should be set. This
11 In his study on science policy in the early years of the Second Republic, König (2012a, 112–13) argues that Lazarsfeld
and Morgenstern's strategy to establish the IHS as a non-university institute should also be understood against the
backdrop of previous unsuccessful attempts to establish empirical social research within universities.
observation is made without diminishing the actual research achievements that were accomplished
at the institute during this time.
A reason for the ambivalence and ambiguity regarding what the institute should achieve is
embedded in its name: the designation Institut für Höhere Studien und wissenschaftliche Forschung
(“Institute for Advanced Studies and Scientific Research”) practically invites a multitude of
expectations. Those familiar with the Anglo-American system may – as early as the 1960s – have
thought of Princeton and its “Institute for Advanced Studies”. Others may have taken the name
literally: are “advanced studies” meant to be pursued here, or perhaps more valuable studies? The
addition of “scientific research” also allows room for interpretation; which research directions are
implied? The fact that there was no consistent answer to these questions remained a constitutive
element of the IHS's history until 2015.
