24 Abstract
25 Human imagination has garnered growing interest in many fields. However, it
26 remains unclear how to characterize different forms of imaginative thinking and how
27 imagination differs between young and older adults. Here, we introduce a novel scoring
28 protocol based on recent theoretical developments in the cognitive neuroscience of
29 imagination to provide a broad tool with which to characterize imaginative thinking. The
30 scoring protocol distinguishes between concrete/perceptual forms of imagination termed
31 the “mind’s eye” and abstract/reflective forms of imagination termed the “mind’s mind.”
32 The protocol also captures whether thoughts pertain to the self, others, or both. We
33 applied this scoring protocol with high inter-rater reliability across two studies involving
34 distinct participants and narrative-based imagination tasks. When compared to young
35 adults, older adults showed a bias toward general content, which is a feature of the
36 mind’s mind form of thinking while describing aloud their memories of specific, past
37 events (Study 1). Further, older adults made fewer references to self. In a separate
38 study of only older adults (Study 2), increasing age was not associated with a bias
39 toward the mind’s mind while describing specific past or future events. These results
40 reveal that imaginative thinking can be characterized within the Mind’s Eye Mind’s Mind
41 framework, with implications for understanding cognitively normal older age.
45 Introduction
46 Human imagination, the ability to form internal images or ideas not present to the
47 senses1, allows us to mentally transcend space and time to remember the past, think
48 about the future, and engage in many other forms of thinking2. While a large body of
49 research has examined these different manifestations of imagination, we recently
50 proposed a broader neurocognitive organization differentiating distinct component
51 processes of imagination referred to as the “mind’s eye” (concrete, image-based) and
52 the “mind’s mind” (abstract, verbal-based)3,4. In the present study, we use the Mind’s
53 Eye Mind’s Mind framework, first, to develop a novel scoring protocol to quantify these
54 processes and second, to gain insight into how past and future thinking may differ
55 between young and older adults.
56 A common thread among theories of imaginative thinking is that this form of
57 cognition is an outcome of multiple processes that can interact or operate
58 independently3–7. Drawing on the episodic and semantic memory distinction8,
59 researchers note, for example, that theorized processes underlying episodic memories,
60 such as perceptual processing5,6 and relational binding9, may be important for past and
61 future thinking. Researchers have made a similar claim for semantic memory, with
62 conceptual, abstract, and reflective thinking identified as candidate processes of
63 imagination5,10–12. Other views draw less from the episodic and semantic dichotomy,
64 and instead offer that self-projection13 or mental scene construction14,15 are central to
65 imagination. Observing the presumed neural correlates of these theorized processes,
66 researchers have further proposed that the brain’s default network underlies many
67 processes central to human imagination4,16,17.
68 Recently, we proposed that many of the ideas related to imagination and the
69 default network appear to coalesce around two broad component processes that form
70 the basis of human imagination3. In this overarching framework, the mind’s eye reflects
71 imagination experienced at low levels of construal, including concrete and contextually
72 specific thoughts, often using an image-based representational form. Neuroscience
73 research suggests that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) subsystem of the default
74 network18, also referred to as the posterior-medial episodic network19 and a closely
75 aligned “DMN-A subsystem” 20, plays an important role in mind’s eye forms of
76 imaginative thinking3–5. In contrast, the mind’s mind is proposed to capture imaginative
77 thought experienced at higher levels of construal, involving abstract and reflective forms
78 of imagination more accessible to a verbal representational form. According to this
79 framework, the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) subsystem of the default
80 network18, which is closely aligned with the DMN-B subsystem20, is principally linked to
81 the mind’s mind component of imaginative thinking3,4.
82 Based on the Mind’s Eye Mind’s Mind framework, we can expect imagination to
83 take one form or the other to varying degrees as a function of the involvement of the
84 underlying subsystems. Neuropsychological cases have served as one source of
85 supporting evidence for this claim. For instance, individuals with medial temporal lobe
86 amnesia display impairments when past, future, and atemporal imagined thoughts
87 involve constructing specific details21–23, visualizing scenes24, and retrieving visually
88 complex or spatiotemporally specific knowledge25–30. Likewise, individuals with semantic
89 dementia, which disproportionately affects the dmPFC subsystem, can comprehend
90 concrete words better than abstract words31 and show less impairment in episodic
91 memory compared to semantic memory32. Importantly, although neuropsychological
92 cases can provide insight into extreme shifts in imagination, the Mind’s Eye Mind’s Mind
93 framework proposes much broader state, trait, and life course variations in default
94 network involvement that shape the form of imagined thought. One such life course
95 stage, and the focus of the present study, is typical older age.
96 Research in psychology and neuroscience has raised the possibility that typical
97 older age may show a natural, possibly adaptive, shift toward the mind’s mind in service
98 of certain forms of imagination. Functional neuroimaging studies, for example, have
99 shown that older adults, relative to young adults, tend to overactivate regions of the
100 dmFPC subsystem, and underactivate regions of the MTL subsystem, while mentally
101 constructing and elaborating past and future events33,34. Likewise, it is well established
102 that older adults, when compared to young adults, provide less episodic or event-
103 specific details and more semantic details while orally describing past and future events
104 in laboratory settings35,36. In fact, these findings are commonly interpreted as evidence
105 that older adults may be taking a more conceptual or reflective strategy toward event
106 memory retrieval and future event thinking, perhaps due to a lack of access to specific
107 information and/or a change in motivation that shifts imagination toward a high level of
construal37–39.
109 Despite suggestive functional neuroimaging and cognitive aging findings,
110 whether cognitively healthy older age is associated with a mind’s mind shift remains
111 unclear. A major reason underlying this gap is that the field lacks a scoring protocol to
112 assess the interactions between concrete and abstract information across the full
113 spectrum of imaginative thought (e.g., event remembering, mind-wandering, self-
114 reflection, among others). As such, the explanatory value of the Mind’s Eye Mind’s Mind
115 framework for understanding typical older age, or other trait, state, and life course
116 factors, remains unanswered. In the present study, we set out to begin closing this gap
117 by creating a scoring protocol that can be applied to characterize the relative use of the
118 mind’s eye and the mind’s mind.
119 The novel scoring protocol also captures a potential preference to relate
120 imagined thoughts to either the self or others, which is relevant for another age-related
121 shift that is understudied in the literature. In particular, older adults might show a bias
122 toward thinking more about others (as opposed to the self), due to socioemotional goals
123 that place importance on social relationships40,41. For example, recent work has shown
124 that during less cognitively demanding tasks (e.g., mind wandering), the content of older
125 adults’ thoughts are less self-related and more other-related compared to young
126 adults42,43. Although research on the content of imaginative thoughts in older adults is
127 limited, possible factors such as motivation/interest44, emotional-wellbeing45, and a
128 positivity bias46 might contribute to differences between young and older adults in the
129 content of imaginative thought47. In recognition of these findings on self-referential
130 thought and socioemotional goals in aging, we may expect age-related differences in
131 references to the self and to others in many forms of imaginative thought. Therefore, we
132 incorporated self-other orientation in the novel scoring protocol.
133 Based on prior work examining various cognitive and neural aspects of
134 imaginative thinking, the present set of studies tested four hypotheses about aging and
135 imagination. First, compared to young adults, we hypothesized that cognitively healthy
136 older adults would show a bias for the mind’s mind while engaging in imagination, as
137 shown by how past events are remembered (Study 1). Second, we hypothesized that
138 the shift toward the mind’s mind might continue to evolve in older adulthood, as shown
139 by a cross-sectional relationship with age among a separate cohort of cognitively
140 healthy older adults tasked with remembering past events and thinking about future
141 events (Study 2). Third, we hypothesized that the propensity to use mind’s eye and
142 mind’s mind would be consistent across past and future forms of imagination, given
143 prior work showing consistency in episodic and semantic information in these two forms
144 of thinking48,49, and our expectation that use of the mind’s eye and mind’s mind partly
145 reflect trait-like qualities3. Finally, based on findings showing age-related differences in
146 self and other focus in task-unrelated thought42, we hypothesized that older adults’
147 thoughts would shift to be focused more on others and less on the self when compared
148 to young adults (Study 1), and in association with advanced age among older adults
149 (Study 2).
151 Study 1
152 Methods
153 Participants
154 The first study is a secondary analysis of a dataset composed of 103
155 participants, including 54 young adults (mean age = 22.5 years, mean edu = 15.2 years,
156 number of males = 12) and 49 older adults (mean age = 69.5 years, mean edu = 17.5
157 years, number of males = 13) who were asked to retrieve autobiographical memories
159 determined based on an actuarial approach shown to improve cognitive screening of
160 abnormal age-related cognitive decline51. In brief, individuals were considered
161 cognitively impaired, and thus ineligible for the study, if either of the following were met:
162 (1) they performed more than 1 standard deviation below the age-corrected (and
163 education-corrected, if available) normative mean on two critical scores in one cognitive
164 domain, or (2) they performed more than one standard deviation below the age-
165 corrected (and education-corrected, if available) normative mean on three critical scores
166 across three cognitive domains. None of the older adults in the current study met these
167 criteria. All participants were screened for self-reported neurological disorders and
168 history of psychiatric conditions that could have cognitive effects. Informed consent was
169 obtained from all participants. All study procedures were performed in accordance with
170 relevant guidelines and regulations and approved by the University of Arizona
171 Institutional Review Board.
175 Procedures
176 Autobiographical Interview Task
177 Participants underwent procedures for the Autobiographical Interview35 online.
178 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all participants were seen via Zoom Health (see
179 Hernandez et al., 2024, for validity and applicability of the virtual Autobiographical
180 Interview, as well as results with the Autobiographical Interview scoring). There were no
181 differences in the procedure of the Autobiographical Interview in person versus via
182 Zoom, except that participants were at home during the interview. Each participant
183 recalled five unique life events from multiple time periods (early childhood, adolescence,
184 early adulthood, middle adulthood, and within the last year). Young adults were asked
185 to recall two early adulthood memories rather than one from middle adulthood.
186 Participants were instructed to focus on a specific event that occurred within 24 hours
187 (e.g., a vacation to Hawaii would not be adequate, but one day of that vacation would
188 be). If a participant did not comprehend the instructions or provided a short description
189 of the event, the experimenter gave a general probe (e.g., “Can you recall any other
190 details?”). If a participant did not focus on a specific event, they were asked to select
191 one to focus on (e.g., “Please choose one specific event to focus on”). Oral responses
192 were recorded then transcribed. Participants had up to four minutes to provide their
193 response, after which they were allowed to complete their thought and then signaled to
194 stop if they were still talking. Raters did not score past the four-minute mark.
195 Mind’s Eye Mind’s Mind Scoring Protocol Development
196 We developed the scoring protocol by defining imaginative subtypes that capture
197 the essence of mind’s eye versus mind’s mind forms of imaginative thought. Although
198 we designed the protocol to capture both prompted and unprompted imaginative
199 thoughts, we applied the protocol to autobiographical past and future thoughts in the
200 present studies. Based on prior theoretical and empirical research, we identified six
201 imaginative subtypes (termed elements of thought) as forms of the mind’s eye category
203 within the mind's mind category included content general elements, abstract concept
204 elements, reflection/appraisal elements, inference/reasoning elements, and facts
205 elements. The mind’s eye category consisted of content specific elements, concrete
206 concept elements, spatial location elements, temporal elements, visual elements, and
209 addition, the scoring protocol also captures whether an element of thought (irrespective
210 of its mind’s eye versus mind’s mind classification) was related to the self, others, or
211 both. Our definition posits that the mind’s eye could feasibly be represented using an
212 image-based representational form, whereas the general/abstract nature of the mind’s
213 mind would be more accessible to a verbal representation. However, we do not exclude
214 the possibility that these two forms of imagination interact. Our scoring protocol is
215 developed with this idea in mind, meaning that the typical stream of thought manifests
216 as an interactive mix of the mind’s eye and mind’s mind that unfold over time. For
217 example, thinking about one's dog might accompany an image of one’s own dog but
218 also a reflective thought such as the feeling of love for one’s dog.
224 Scoring Procedures & Psychometric Properties
225 A comprehensive manual of the mind’s eye and mind’s mind scoring protocol
226 with specific examples of how it is applied to different types of thoughts can be found on
228 independently reads the entire narrative before scoring to get a sense of what the
229 narrative is about and to understand the context. Second, the rater parses each
230 narrative into elements of thought using slashes. An element of thought is often a
231 grammatical clause, but it can also be a word. Lastly, the rater adds the element labels
232 for mind’s eye and mind’s mind, including whether the element was related to the self
233 (labelled “self”) and/or related to another person/other people (labelled “other”). Every
234 thought element has only one corresponding label for mind’s eye and mind’s mind, and
236 are not stand alone and are only added to other mind’s eye or mind’s mind elements.
237 For example, “I went to the movies on Saturday” has three mind’s eye elements, one
238 mind’s mind element, and one self/other element added to a mind’s eye element. Based
239 on this scoring protocol: “I” is a concrete concept (CC; mind’s eye) related to the self
240 (+S), “went to” is content general (CG; mind’s mind) because it indicates a non-specific
241 action, “the movies” is coded as a place (LOC; mind’s eye), and “on Saturday” is coded
242 as time (T; mind’s eye). Non-imaginative thoughts and task-related inferences are
243 defined as statements that reflected the present moment and included thoughts about
244 the physical environment (e.g., “My dog just came into the room”), interoceptive
245 perceptions (e.g., “I’m cold”), and thoughts about the task (e.g., “Am I finished?”). These
247 longer example of how the scoring protocol is applied to the data.
251 Two trained raters (MLB and NC), who scored all the transcripts, worked
252 independent of each other and were unaware of participant age. The interrater reliability
253 between both raters, assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)52 and
254 interpreted based on Koo & Li's (2016) guidelines, were excellent for both mind’s eye
255 (ICC = 0.96) and mind’s mind (ICC = 0.93). The reliability was excellent for other-related
256 elements (ICC = 0.98) and good for self-related elements (ICC = 0.86). The reliability for
257 non-imaginative thought elements category was poor (ICC = 0.45), likely due to these
258 elements occurring less frequently. To create a more reliable estimate of the mind’s eye
259 and mind’s mind thought elements, the two raters’ scores were averaged for each
260 participant.
261 In addition to calculating reliability at the level of the mind’s eye and mind’s mind,
263 and standard deviation values for each subtype for each age group, as well as the
264 intraclass correlation coefficient for each subtype. It is important to note that the facts
265 subtype occurred at a much lower frequency than other subtypes in the present study,
266 and thus has a lower intraclass correlation coefficient. All other element subtypes for
268 demonstrates the most to least frequently occurring element subtypes for both mind’s
269 eye and mind’s mind.
275 To further examine the psychometric properties of the scoring protocol we
276 generated a correlation matrix using count data. The correlation matrix illustrates
277 generally strong positive correlations across all element types, suggesting that many of
278 the elements between and across the mind’s eye and mind’s mind are interactive (see
280 conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to assess the underlying structure of the
281 data. Notably, the current study was poorly powered for an EFA of 11 element types,
282 and therefore we interpret the results cautiously. The EFA was conducted with a
283 varimax rotation on box-cox transformed count data. Parallel analysis53 was used to
284 determine the number of factors, which revealed a two-factor solution accounting for
286 The factor loadings did not show a clear categorical separation of the mind’s eye and
287 mind’s mind (see Discussion).
288 The current dataset was also scored with the Autobiographical Interview, which is
289 commonly used to assess the specificity of event memories. Though there are
290 similarities between the Autobiographical Interview scoring protocol and the Mind’s Eye
291 Mind’s Mind scoring protocol, there are a few important differences. First, the element
292 types vary between the scoring protocols and are applied differently to the data such
294 while we apply the Mind’s Eye Mind’s Mind scoring protocol to autobiographical
295 memories and future events in this manuscript, the scoring protocol can be applied to
296 other forms of imaginative thinking beyond specific events, such as resting state
297 thoughts.
299 Statistical Analyses
300 Normality of the data was determined using skew and kurtosis values (with a
301 cutoff of -1 to 1 for skew and -2 to 2 for kurtosis). Effect sizes are reported as Cohen’s d
302 for t-tests and generalized eta squared for analysis of variance (ANOVA) results. For
303 ANOVAs, we used a Bonferroni correction on planned post hoc comparisons. All
304 analyses were performed in R54. Figures were created in R using ggplot255.
305 Study 1 tested two of our four hypotheses, namely that older adults, compared to
306 young adults, have a bias to use the mind’s mind and think less about the self and more
307 about others. We used two different measures to assess our hypotheses, a proportion
308 measure (mind’s mind:total thought elements and other:total thought elements) and a
309 ratio measure (mind’s mind:mind’s eye and other:self ). The proportion measure
310 represents the count of thought elements within each category (mind’s eye and mind’s
311 mind) out of the total number of thought elements (mind’s eye, mind’s mind, and non-
312 imaginative/task-related inferences). The proportion, which provides a percentage
313 measure accounting for non-imaginative thoughts, was highly correlated with the ratio
314 measure (r (101) = .96 for mind’s eye and r (101) = .98 for mind’s mind, p values <
315 .001), which compares the total mind’s mind elements to total mind’s eye elements and
316 is another proxy for bias. For conciseness, we provide details of the ratio results in the
317 Supplementary Information.
318 First, to examine the relative use of the mind’s eye and mind’s mind in young and
319 older adults, we conducted a two-by-two mixed ANOVA using proportion values, with
320 factors for category of imaginative thought (mind’s eye vs. mind’s mind) and age group
321 (older vs. young adults). Second, to measure age group differences in the use of self-
322 related versus other-related thoughts between young and older adults, we conducted a
323 two-by-two mixed ANOVA using proportion values with factors for age group (older vs.
324 young adult) and self-other orientation (self vs. other). We examined the correlation
325 between the proportion and ratio measures and found that they were highly correlated
326 for both self (r (101) = .80, p < .001) and other (r (101) = .91, p < .001). We provide the
327 results of the ratio measure in the Supplementary Information.
328 In addition to these analyses, we also computed Pearson correlations between
329 proportion scores for mind’s eye and mind’s mind, and internal and external details
330 computed from the Autobiographical Interview. This allowed us to examine the shared
331 variance between the Mind’s Eye Mind’s Mind scoring protocol and the Autobiographical
332 Interview scoring protocol. As noted, there are both similarities and differences in the
333 manner of organization of elements and details, and in the application of the scoring
334 protocols (i.e., imaginative thinking broadly defined versus event memories/future
335 thoughts). Given these similarities and differences, and in light of internal details and
336 mind’s eye elements both capturing specific information, we hypothesized a small-to-
337 moderate positive relationship between internal details and mind’s eye elements. We
338 also predicted a small-to-moderate positive relationship between external details and
339 mind’s mind elements given that they are both capturing semantic information, although
340 the mind’s mind also captures other information such as making inferences or
341 appraisals.
343 Study 1 Results
344 Older adults show more of a tendency to use the mind’s mind compared to young adults
345 Descriptive statistics for the proportion of mind’s mind and mind’s eye elements
346 and ratio of mind’s mind to mind’s eye elements are reported in Supplementary Tables

349 effect of age group, F (1,101) = .64, p = .42, η2 = .00034. Collapsing across age
350 groups, proportion of mind’s eye elements (M=0.57, SD=0.03) was significantly greater
351 than the proportion of mind’s mind elements (M=0.40, SD=0.03), t (102) = 28.5, p <

357 elements (M=0.58, SD=0.03) compared to older adults (M=0.56, SD=0.03), t (101) =

367 subtype, F (4,404) = 1800.47, p < .001, η2 = .94, and an interaction between age group
368 and element subtype, F (4,404) = 5.72, p < .001, η2 = .05. Planned comparisons using
369 a Bonferroni correction revealed that older adults exhibited a greater number of content
370 general elements compared to young adults, t (101) = 3.63, p < .001. There were no
371 significant differences between young and older adults for all other element subtypes.
372 To further analyze which element subtype occurs more frequently, we examined the
373 main effect of subtype which showed that all comparisons between subtypes were
374 significant using a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, all t’s ≥ 14.4, p’s <
375 .001. Content general elements occurred most frequently, followed by abstract concept,
376 reflections/appraisal, inference/reasoning, and the least frequently occurring was facts
378 The ANOVA for mind’s eye showed a significant main effect of age group, F

380 (5,505) = 2825.72, p < .001, η2 = .96, but there was not a significant interaction
381 between age group and element subtype, F (5,505) = 1.03, p = .40, η2 = .009. To
382 examine which mind’s eye element subtype occurs more frequently, we examined the
383 main effect of subtype which revealed that all but one comparison between subtypes
384 were significant using a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, all t’s ≥ 2.55, p’s
385 < .001. The most frequently occurring element subtype was concrete concept, followed
386 by content specific, time, spatial location, visual, and the least frequently occurring was
388 visual elements and sensory elements, t (103) = 2.6, p =.17.

398 = 2.37, p = .13, η2 = .005. Collapsing across age groups, proportion of self-related
399 elements (M=0.15, SD=0.03) was significantly greater than the proportion of other-
400 related elements (M=0.10, SD=0.03), t (102) = 11.65, p < .001. There was also a
401 significant self-other orientation by age group interaction, F (1,101) = 4.96, p = .028, η2

404 t (101) = 2.81, p = .006, d = 0.55. However, there was no significant difference between

413 (i.e., internal details:total details) were positively correlated, r (101) = .26, p = .007, as
414 well as proportion scores for mind’s mind and external details (i.e., external details:total
415 details), r (101) = .22, p = .03. The cross correlations were also significant such that the
416 mind’s eye and external details were negatively correlated, r (101) = -.26, p = .006 and
417 mind’s mind and internal details were also negatively correlated, r (101) = -.22, p = .03.
418 Study 1 Discussion
419 Consistent with our hypotheses, Study 1 results revealed that cognitively healthy
420 older adults, compared to young adults, show a relatively greater use of the mind’s
421 mind, in particular content-general elements, and a decreased use of the mind’s eye,
422 when retrieving autobiographical event memories. In addition, results show that the
423 narrated autobiographical memories of older adults, compared to young adults, are
424 related less to the self. In addition, we show that the Autobiographical Interview scoring
425 protocol and the Mind’s Eye Mind’s Mind scoring protocol are significantly, albeit
426 weakly, correlated. We next turn to Study 2, in which we examined 1) whether the
427 mind’s eye and mind’s mind are similarly called on during past and future forms of
428 imaginative event thinking among older adults, and 2) whether there is a bias to use the
429 mind’s mind and to focus on others with advanced older age.
431 Study 2
432 Methods
433 Participants
434 Study 2 was a secondary analysis of an experiment involving remembering past
435 events and thinking about hypothetical future events (for details see: Acevedo-Molina et
436 al., 2023). Eighty-five individuals between the ages of 60-80 years old participated in
437 this study. Two participants were discontinued because they did not understand study
438 task procedures. One other participant did not return for the second session. Thus, 82
439 total remaining participants were analyzed and reviewed in this study. Demographic and
441 was enriched with carriers of the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE)56.
442 Participants were assessed as clinically normal based on a comprehensive battery of
443 neuropsychological tests51, using the same criteria to determine eligibility as Study 1. All
444 participants were screened for self-reported neurological and history of psychiatric
445 conditions that could have cognitive effects. Participants had to score below the cutoff
446 score of 16 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale indicative of
447 risk for clinical depression57 and report being independent in activities of daily living.
448 Informed consent was obtained from all participants. All study procedures were
449 performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations and approved by the
450 University of Arizona Institutional Review Board.
452 Study Procedures
453 Past and Future Thinking Task
454 The past and future thinking task, adopted from Addis et al., 201049, was spread
455 over seven days with two different sessions. The purpose of the first session was to
456 gather memories that could serve as past or future thinking trials. Participants were
457 asked to generate 16 memories from the past five years and were told that each
458 memory must contain what they considered a “very vivid and detailed” person, object,
459 and place and that these details needed to be unique for each memory. To encourage
460 retrieval, participants were cued with 16 pictures (selected via Google image searches),
461 which generally corresponded to the meaning of 16 words selected from the Clark and
462 Paivio norms58 that were scored high on frequency (mean = 1.84), imageability (mean =
463 5.91), and concreteness (mean = 6.71). Participants were informed that they need not
464 rely on the pictures to cue retrieval. The first trial was used for practice and discarded,
465 leaving 15 memory generation trials to be used for Session 2.
466 Between session one and two, an experimenter randomly selected five memories
467 to serve as memory (past thinking) trials. These person-object-place detail triplets were
468 preserved. The future thinking trials were created by recombining the people, objects,
469 and places from the remaining ten memories. The experimenter ensured that each
470 recombined triplet was entirely new. Five of these recombined triplets were randomly
471 selected as future thinking trials, two were selected for practice, and three were
472 available in case a selected triplet was reported as improbable.
473 In the second session, participants were told that they would need to recall some
474 memories (past thinking task) that they generated in session one, in addition to thinking
475 of several new events that could happen in the next five years (future thinking task).
476 Participants were shown a triplet of a person, place, and object and were asked to
477 either recall the previously generated past event from session one or think of a future
478 event happening in the next five years with a recombined triplet from the memory task.
479 The order of the past and future thinking trials was quasi-randomized so that no more
480 than two trials of either task were presented sequentially. Participants were instructed to
481 focus on the unique features of the event and to include the three unique details from
482 the triplet. If the participant was presented with an improbable event on a future thinking
483 trial (e.g., a person who had passed away), they informed the experimenter, who would
484 then select a new triplet. Each participant was given four minutes per trial. The
485 participant’s responses were audio recorded then subsequently transcribed. Raters did
486 not score past the four-minute mark.
487 Scoring Procedure & Reliability
488 Participants completed ten narratives (five for past thinking and five for future
489 thinking). Eleven participants completed only four narratives for memory and four for
490 future thinking due to time constraints. The same metrics as in Study 1 were extracted
491 from both the past and future narratives using the same procedure and protocol. As with
492 Study 1, Study 2 also had two trained raters (authors MH and NC) who scored all the
493 transcripts and were unaware of participant age. However, in Study 2, rater MH scored
494 all the transcripts and rater NC scored 24% of the transcripts to calculate reliability. The
495 analyzed data was derived from rater MH’s scoring. The reliability was excellent for
496 mind’s mind-past (ICC = 0.97), mind’s eye-past (ICC = 0.98), mind’s eye-future (ICC =
497 0.97), and mind’s mind-future (ICC = 0.96). Reliability of self- and other-related
498 elements was excellent for self-past (ICC = 0.92) and good for other-past (ICC = 0.87),
499 self-future (ICC = 0.82), and other-future (ICC = 0.84). The reliability of non-imaginative
500 thoughts was moderate for the past thinking task (ICC = 0.60) and for the future thinking
501 task (ICC = 0.66).
503 Statistical Analyses
504 Normality of the data was dealt with in the same way as in Study 1. Effect sizes
505 are reported as Cohen’s d for t-tests and generalized eta squared for ANOVA results.
506 For ANOVAs, we used a Bonferroni correction on planned post hoc comparisons.
507 Analyses were performed in R54. Figures were created in R using ggplot255.
508 Consistent with Study 1, we examined both proportion and ratio measures and
509 found that the ratio measure had a strong and positive correlation with the proportion
510 results for both future thinking (mind’s mind r (80) = .99 and mind’s eye r (80) = .97, p
511 values < .001) and past thinking (mind’s mind r (80) = .99 and mind’s eye, r (80) = .97, p
512 values < .001). For conciseness, we provide the ratio results in the Supplementary
513 Information.
514 To examine whether the categories (i.e., mind’s eye and mind’s mind) were being
515 used to a similar extent across both tasks (i.e., past and future thinking tasks), we
516 conducted a Pearson correlation using the proportion of mind’s mind and mind’s eye
517 elements in each task. Then, we conducted a two-way repeated measures ANOVA
518 using proportion values with factors for category of imaginative thought (mind’s eye and
519 mind’s mind) and task type (past and future thinking), as this could inform whether the
520 relative weighting of the mind’s eye and mind’s mind differs between past and future
521 thinking.
522 To examine whether advanced age is associated with a shift toward the mind’s
523 mind in both past and future thinking, we conducted a Spearman correlation (given that
524 age was not normally distributed) using the proportion measure and age as a
525 continuous variable. To assess if older age is associated with a shift toward thoughts
526 related to others, we conducted a Spearman correlation between the proportion of
527 other-related elements and age for both the past and future thinking tasks. To analyze if
528 there were differences in production of self- versus other-related information in past and
529 future thinking, we conducted a two-way repeated measures ANOVA using proportion
530 values with factors for self-other orientation (self vs. other) and task type (past vs.
531 future). We also conducted these analyses using the ratio measure. Given that the
532 correlation between the proportion and ratio measures were significantly correlated for
533 both past thinking (self r (80) = .60, other r (80) = .73, p values < .001) and future
534 thinking (self r (80) = .78, other r (80) = .60, p values < .001), we provide the ratio
535 results in the Supplementary Information.
537 Study 2 Results
538 Older adults show relatively stable use of mind’s mind with advanced older age
539 Descriptive statistics for the proportion of mind’s eye and mind’s mind elements
540 and ratio of mind’s mind to mind’s eye elements are reported in Supplementary Tables
541 S2 and S3. Regarding the relationship between the past and future thinking tasks, we
542 found significant, moderate-to-large correlations for the proportion of mind’s mind
543 elements, r (80) = .68, p < .001 and mind’s eye elements, r (80) = .69, p < .001 between
545 mind elements (as well as mind’s eye elements) to describe past experiences, also tend
546 to use more mind’s mind elements (as well as mind’s eye elements) to describe
547 hypothetical future events. The ratio measure shows consistent findings and can be
549 The two-way repeated measures ANOVA did not show a main effect of task type,
550 F (1,81) = 1.06, p = .31, η2 = 0.00009, such that the total proportion of imaginative
551 thought elements did not significantly vary between past and future thinking. Similar to
552 Study 1, we observed a significant main effect of category of imaginative thought, F
553 (1,81) = 434.12, p < .001, η2 = .81, such that there was a greater proportion of mind’s
554 eye elements (M=0.58, SD=0.05) than mind’s mind elements (M=0.39, SD=0.04).
555 Critically, we did not observe a significant interaction between task type and category of
556 imaginative thought, F (1,81) = 0.13, p = .72, η2 = 0.00024, indicating that the relative
557 differences in proportion of mind’s eye and mind’s mind elements did not vary across
558 the past and future thinking tasks. A follow up Repeated Measures Bayesian ANOVA
559 revealed substantial evidence for a lack of an interaction between mind’s mind and
560 mind’s eye in past and future thinking, BF = 0.17. The ratio measure showed
561 consistent results regarding the use of the mind’s mind relative to the mind’s eye in past
566 Correlations between age and proportion of mind’s mind and mind’s eye
568 proportion of mind’s mind elements and advancing age among older adults, we did not
569 find a significant relationship for either the past thinking task, ρ (80) = .009, p = .94 or
570 the future thinking task, ρ (80) = .13, p = .23. Similarly, we did not find a significant
571 relationship between the proportion of mind’s eye elements and advancing age for the
572 past thinking task, ρ (80) = -.1, p = .39 or the future thinking task, ρ (80) = -.15, p = .18.
573 The ratio measure was consistent with the proportion results and can be found in
576 Although older adults show a tendency to reference others more than the self in past
577 and future thinking, this tendency was not associated with advanced age
578 Descriptive statistics for the ratio of mind’s mind to mind’s eye elements and
579 proportion of self- and other-related elements can be found in Supplementary Tables S3
580 and S4. The relationships between the proportion of self- and other-related elements
582 Advanced age was not significantly related to the proportion of other-related elements
583 for the past thinking task, ρ (80) = -.04, p = .75, or the future thinking task, ρ (80) = -.08,
584 p = .46. In addition, advanced age was not significantly related to the proportion of self-
585 related elements in either the past thinking task, ρ (80) = -.04, p = .73 or future thinking
586 task, ρ (80) = .007, p = .95. Results for the ratio measure shows consistent findings and
588 A two (self vs. other) by two (past vs. future) repeated-measures ANOVA revealed
589 a significant main effect of self-other orientation, F (1,81) = 218.91, p < .001, η2 = .53
590 but not task type, F (1,81) = 3.56, p = .063, η2 = 0.005. Specifically, we observed a
591 greater proportion of other-related elements (M=0.13, SD=0.03) than self-related
592 elements (M=0.08, SD=0.02). However, the proportion of referenced elements did not
593 significantly vary between past and future thinking. In addition, we observed a
594 significant interaction between task type and self-other orientation, F (1,81) = 19.76, p <
595 .001, η2 = 0.033. Post-hoc t-tests revealed a greater proportion of other related
596 elements in the future thinking task (M=0.14, SD=0.03) compared to the past thinking
597 task (M=0.12, SD=0.03), t (81) = 3.87, p < .001, d = 0.43, and a lower proportion of self-
598 related elements in the future thinking task (M=0.07, SD=0.02) compared to the past
599 thinking task (M=0.08, SD=0.02), t (81) = 2.48, p = .015, d = -0.27. The ratio results,
600 which are consistent with the proportion findings related to self-other orientation, can be
603 Study 2 Discussion
604 Three important findings emerged from Study 2. First, we showed that the mind’s
605 eye and mind’s mind, as measured by our novel scoring protocol, were used
606 consistently across two types of imaginative thinking among older adults. This was
607 demonstrated by moderate-to-strong correlations in the use of mind’s eye and mind’s
608 mind process when remembering the past and thinking about the future, and in the
609 relative use of the mind’s eye and mind’s mind across past and future thinking. Second,
610 we did not observe a change in the use of either the mind’s eye or mind’s mind with
611 advancing age among older adults. Lastly, and counter to our hypotheses, advanced
612 older age was not associated with a shift in the proportion of other-related thoughts or
613 the ratio of other- to self-related thoughts.
615 General Discussion
616 The present study sought to close the gap in knowledge regarding how the
617 mind’s eye and mind’s mind components of imagination are expressed in
618 autobiographical past and future thinking in young and older adults. To investigate a
619 proposal informed by the broad literature on imagination and the default network3, we
620 developed and applied a novel scoring protocol to measure the relative use of two
621 processes, namely the mind’s eye and the mind’s mind, in two forms of imagination,
622 past and future thinking. We applied this scoring protocol to a study examining
623 imaginative thinking in young and older adults, and a separate study consisting of only
624 older adults. There were four main findings. First, we demonstrate that the use of mind’s
625 eye and mind’s mind is consistent with the framework we proposed, including reliability
626 in objective scoring (Study 1 and Study 2) and consistency in how these two cognitive
627 processes are called upon while engaged in various forms of imaginative thought (i.e.,
628 past and future thinking, Study 2). Second, we found a significant age-related shift in the
629 balance of mind’s eye and mind’s mind. Although young and older adults both used
630 mind’s eye more than mind’s mind in Study 1 (possibly influenced by the nature of the
631 task), this difference was significantly weaker in healthy older adults, which appeared to
632 be driven by greater use of content general elements. Third, the relative use of the
633 mind’s eye and mind’s mind was stable in relation to advanced older age in Study 2.
634 Lastly, although both young and older adults had a greater proportion of self-related
635 thoughts compared to other-related thoughts in Study 1, this difference was significantly
636 weaker in healthy older adults, suggesting less of a self-focused bias in older adults.
637 Interestingly, in Study 2, the older adult cohort showed a clear bias toward other-related
638 thinking, but the relative referencing of self and others was stable with advanced older
639 age. Below we discuss the implications of these findings and directions for future
640 research.
641 To address our first study goal of developing a novel scoring protocol for mind’s
642 eye and mind’s mind, we examined reliability not only in how raters apply the scoring
643 protocol, but also in how participants draw on content to engage related forms of
644 imaginative thinking. Regarding experimenter reliability, both studies showed high
645 interrater reliability across multiple raters (ICC’s ≥ 0.90) for mind’s eye and mind’s mind.
646 Likewise, in Study 2, we found that older adults engaged the mind’s eye and mind’s
647 mind in similar ways across two different forms of imagination (i.e., remembered events
648 versus future event thinking), as shown by moderate to strong significant correlations
649 between the proportion of mind’s eye and mind’s mind elements. Furthermore,
650 consistent with the instructions to be specific in the event retrieval and future thinking
651 tasks in both Study 1 and 2, a significantly greater proportion of thoughts were classified
652 as mind’s eye than mind’s mind. This is noteworthy given that there were significant
653 methodological differences across studies, including the timeframe of imagination (i.e.,
654 past or future) and the content or nature of what was to be imagined. In addition, the
655 proportion of mind’s eye and mind’s mind did not vary based on the type of task (i.e.,
656 past versus future thinking) in Study 2. Taken together, these results support several
657 key aspects of the Mind’s Eye Mind’s Mind framework and provide evidence for the
658 stability and reliability of the scoring protocol.
659 In terms of the second goal to understand how mind’s eye and mind’s mind forms
660 of imagination shift in older age, results reveal that although both groups in Study 1
661 showed a bias for mind’s eye thinking, this bias was statistically weaker for healthy older
662 adults. Older adults, compared to young adults, used the mind’s mind relatively more
663 regardless of whether we examined ratio or proportional measures. In the context of
664 autobiographical event remembering, the content general element subtype of the mind’s
665 mind was mainly responsible for the difference between young and older adults.
666 Consistent with the literature on event-based forms of autobiographical memory, these
667 findings suggest that older adults compared to young adults show a tendency to use
668 more abstract, conceptual information48,59,60, and less specific contextual details61,62.
669 This might be associated with age-related changes in the default network during
670 autobiographical memory and episodic future thinking, which may affect the MTL
671 subsystem more than the dmPFC subsystem in typical older age33,37,63,64.
672 In regard to shifts within older adults, Study 2 did not reveal changes in the
673 relative use of mind’s mind and mind’s eye across older age in either the past thinking
674 task (i.e., when they were asked to recall memories from the past five years) or the
675 future thinking task (i.e., when they were asked to come up with events that could
676 happen in the next five years). This finding might suggest that in typical older age, the
677 use of mind’s mind and mind’s eye is relatively stable. This is consistent with work that
678 has highlighted the relatively stable, and even enhanced, use of conceptual and gist
679 information in normal aging38,65,66. This finding may also be related to work on the
680 default network which has shown that the dmPFC subsystem is involved in more
681 abstract conceptual processing16, which might be more strongly recruited in older adults
682 in autobiographical past and future thinking33. However, more work is needed to assess
683 default network subsystem changes in older age, and how this might contribute to a
684 shift toward the mind’s mind. Notably, we used a recombination task (Addis et al. 2010)
685 that may limit the role of abstract future thinking, as the task controls temporal distance
686 and the primary content of the imagined event.
687 Another major finding from the present study was that both young and older
688 adults differ in the extent to which they refer to themselves (self-related) and to other
689 people (other-related). Although in Study 1 both young and older adults showed a
690 greater proportion of self-related thoughts, older adults showed less of a self-focused
691 bias than young adults. Within the older adult cohort in Study 2, older participants’
692 relative use of self and other reversed such that older adults showed a clear bias toward
693 other-related thoughts compared to self-related thoughts, possibly because the task in
694 Study 2 required participants to include another person in the memory or future event.
695 However, in Study 2 advanced older age was not significantly related to the proportion
696 of other-related thoughts or the ratio of other- to self-related thoughts, suggesting that
697 thoughts related to the self and others may be stable in healthy older age. These
698 findings add to the relatively little data on content of thoughts in older adults. In
699 particular, our findings align with work in spontaneous thinking and experience
700 sampling, which has shown that older adults demonstrate less self-referential thoughts
701 than young adults42,43. In contrast, the current study aligns less with work in resting-
702 state contexts, where there is no explicit task and participants are asked to
703 retrospectively evaluate their thoughts, which has revealed no significant age
704 differences between self-focused versus other-focused thoughts47. These findings can
705 be couched in the broader literature on the socioemotional goals in older age, in
706 particular, that older adults prioritize emotionally important relationships due to changing
707 time horizons40,46,67,68. Nonetheless, findings from the current study and prior literature
708 suggest there may be contexts in which young and older adults differ in how much they
709 reference themselves and others. The current scoring protocol provides a novel and
710 accessible way to objectively assess these thoughts in different forms of imaginative
711 thinking in both young and older adults.
712 Although the present study provides key behavioral insights, it also raises new
713 questions for future research. For instance, an important future direction of this work will
714 involve examining whether the subsystems of the default network3,4 support the mind’s
715 eye and mind’s mind as hypothesized. Default network subsystem involvement in
716 different forms of thought might be particularly important in older populations, as the
717 default network is targeted in neurodegenerative disease37. Relatedly, the Mind’s Eye
718 Mind’s Mind framework posits that these two forms of thought are distinct but can
719 interact when the subsystems of the default network are functional. This might mean
720 that certain features of the mind’s mind may prompt certain features of the mind’s eye,
721 and vice versa. Our correlation analyses, and the corresponding preliminary exploratory
722 factor analysis, may hint at element types that tend to prompt interaction, but future
723 work could more directly explore this hypothesis using temporally dynamic approaches,
724 as well as examine if the two subsystems dissociate in clinical populations for whom
725 one type of imaginative thought may be disrupted (e.g. hippocampal amnesia may
726 disrupt the mind’s eye which might mean a stronger mind’s mind). Although our scoring
727 protocol aims to capture the representational form of imaginative thinking as either more
728 verbal or visual, one potential limitation is that the scoring protocol makes an inference
729 based on language. If a person expresses that they love their dog, our scoring protocol
730 would infer that the reference to the dog is a concrete concept which may or may not be
731 associated with visual imagery. A future study may therefore combine behavioral and
732 functional neuroimaging methods and/or corroborate the findings with self-reported
733 phenomenology to refine the Mind’s Eye Mind’s Mind framework. The current study also
734 focuses primarily on the self/other distinction given prior work showing age related
735 changes in this aspect of thought. However, other features of thought such as emotional
736 characteristics and focus on personal goals may also provide insight for understanding
737 age related changes in imaginative thinking. Future work should explore these other
738 features of thought in different types of imaginative thinking.
739 Another important future direction for this work involves examining how the
740 mind’s eye and mind’s mind function in unprompted or other forms of imaginative
741 thinking. For example, periods of unprompted imaginative thought, where participants
742 vocalize what is on their minds in the moment, can provide information not granted by
743 tasks with specific instructions43,47,69. This includes how the content of thoughts can be
744 captured dynamically70, which may reveal different characteristics related to trait
745 brooding71 and creativity72, and can further elucidate age differences in thought
746 content73. Indeed, similarities between the cognitive and neural processes that support
747 different forms of thinking have led to a shift in perspective on what constitutes
748 imaginative thought5,7,74,75. The novel scoring protocol presented here provides a
749 valuable tool with which to characterize these thoughts and capture age-related
750 changes that occur in different forms of imaginative thinking.
751 To further evaluate the psychometric properties of the Mind’s Eye Mind’s Mind
752 scoring protocol, we generated a correlation matrix and conducted an exploratory factor
753 analysis on total count data (see Supplementary Information), similar to Lockrow et al.
754 (2023). Notably, the Mind’s Eye Mind’s Mind framework does not stipulate that all
755 subtypes of one form of imagination must be positively correlated or negatively
756 correlated with the other form of imaginative thought. In fact, it is likely that there are
757 cross category correlations, given that the mind’s eye and mind’s mind are presumed to
758 be highly interactive in healthy cognition, especially during the temporal unfolding of
759 autobiographical narratives. Future research is needed to determine whether the pattern
760 and magnitude of correlations between element subtypes is consistent across forms of
761 imagination and whether the element subtypes load on to the default network
762 subsystems in line with the main tenant of the theory. Until these questions are
763 addressed, we recommend that users of the Mind’s Eye Mind’s Mind scoring protocol
764 analyze element subtypes, in addition to aggregated mind’s eye and mind’s mind
765 scores.
766 Several scoring protocols have emerged in recent years to understand the
767 content of event memories77,78. Consistent with this work, we sought to understand how
768 the Mind’s Eye Mind’s Mind scoring protocol relates to the event, detail-based scoring of
769 the Autobiographical Interview. Our analyses showed that there are significant, albeit
770 small, correlations between the proportion of elements defined as mind’s eye or mind’s
771 mind and the proportion of internal and external details, as defined by the
772 Autobiographical Interview scoring protocol. The relationships are consistent with the
773 notion that the two scoring protocols treat certain elements or details similarly (e.g.,
774 internal details are specific to an event, with specificity being a quality of the mind’s
775 eye). However, the fact that correlations were small in magnitude suggests that the two
776 protocols have distinct features. One potential advantage of the Mind’s Eye Mind’s Mind
777 scoring protocol is that it may not only measure event memories and future thoughts,
778 but also other forms of imaginative thinking.
779 In conclusion, by applying a novel scoring protocol, we show that imaginative
780 thinking can be reliably characterized as a function of the mind’s eye and the mind’s
781 mind. This work adds to the growing body of research that highlights the interdependent
782 nature of imaginative thought5,7,28,74. Here, we have shown that the mind’s mind and
783 mind’s eye are instantiated differently between young and older adults and are
784 applicable to different kinds of thinking (e.g., past and future). The scoring protocol
785 introduced here is meant to capture different forms of imaginative thinking, including
786 mind wandering and mentalizing. This novel model, if replicated and expanded, may
787 provide an understanding of imaginative thinking that can perhaps guide clinical
788 investigations into the different neurological and psychological disorders that might
789 impact different aspects of imaginative thought.
