Acevedo Molina-Bilingualism, aging, and memory
Abstract
Objective: Significant gaps remain in our knowledge of cognitive aging in Hispanic adults, the
largest and fastest-growing minority group in the United States (U.S.). Episodic autobiographical
memory (EAM), which has well documented age-related differences, has not been directly
examined in older U.S. Hispanic adults – a population that is commonly bilingual. This study aimed
to examine the effects of Spanish-English bilingualism and aging on EAM among Hispanic adults.
Methods: In the present study 100 young and middle-aged/older Hispanic adults (50 English-
Spanish bilingual Hispanic participants and 50 monolingual English-speaking Hispanic
participants) narrated EAMs in a structured interview. We assessed these narratives for episodic
and non-episodic details using an established scoring protocol.
Results: We replicated the commonly observed age-related decrease in episodic detail
generation among Hispanic participants, with non-episodic detail not significantly differing
between young and older Hispanic participants. Among young Hispanic participants, bilingualism
was associated with higher episodic, but not non-episodic, detail generation. This bilingualism
advantage for episodic detail, however, was not evident among older Hispanic participants.
Conclusions: These results underscore the complex interplay between bilingualism and age in
autobiographical memory for events among Hispanic adults. Our study highlights the importance
of including diverse race/ethnic and linguistic samples in cognitive aging research to better
understand how bilingualism and cultural factors influence memory across the lifespan.
Keywords: bilingualism, aging, autobiographical memory, language, cultural neuropsychology,

Acevedo Molina-Bilingualism, aging, and memory
Introduction
Hispanic individuals are the largest racial/ethnic minority population in the United States
(U.S.) and represent one of the most rapidly expanding segments within the aging population, a
trajectory projected to persist in the foreseeable future (Pew Research Center, 2022; Latino Policy
& Politics Initiative at UCLA, 2022). Nonetheless, there are significant gaps in our understanding
of how cognition changes, or not, with older age in U.S. Hispanic adults. One unknown pertains
to how typical aging influences the way Hispanic individuals learn and remember personal,
autobiographical memories. This becomes particularly relevant considering the prevalence of
bilingualism among the Hispanic population (Pew Research Center, 2004), which may shape the
way autobiographical memories are orally recalled and shared with others in daily life (Libersky
et al., 2023), and may delay or alter signs of age differences in this type of memory (Bialystok et
al., 2014; Kavé et al., 2008; Chertkow et al., 2010; Anderson, Hawrylewicz, & Grundy, 2020). In
the present study, we sought to determine how a well-established finding in cognitive aging,
namely that older adults tend to recall autobiographical life events in less specific detail relative
to young adults, applies in a sample of bilingual and monolingual U.S. Hispanic adults.
Episodic autobiographical memory (EAM) retrieval is the mental capacity that allows
individuals to recall specific events from their own lives. It encompasses the retrieval of specific
details, emotions, and other contextual information related to singular moments in time (Conway,
2005; Prebble et al., 2013), contributing to one's sense of identity, decision making, and social
interactions (Conway et al., 2004, Fivush et al., 2011, Alea & Bluck, 2003). Prior research has
established that young and older adults differ in the way they orally retrieve and narrate EAMs
(Addis et al., 2008; Schacter et al., 2013). Arguably the most prominent age difference in EAM
retrieval pertains to episodic specificity, as defined by older adults, relative to young adults,
narrating their EAMs with fewer details that capture the uniqueness of a singular moment and
instead producing more details describing the background knowledge and meaning of the
experience (Levine et al., 2002; Schacter et al., 2013). Although the exact reasons for the young
Acevedo Molina-Bilingualism, aging, and memory
versus older adult difference in episodic specificity are a subject of ongoing research, they are
believed to reflect a combination of cognitive, neurological, and psychosocial factors associated
with typical aging (Park et al., 2017; Raz, 2000; Wang & Ross, 2007; Grilli & Sheldon, 2023).
Most of our knowledge of how EAM retrieval differs between young and older adults comes
from studies with samples primarily composed of non-Hispanic White adults or with populations
in which race/ethnic background is not reported. As such, we know virtually nothing about the
influence of older age on EAM retrieval in Hispanic adults. In fact, to date, no study has directly
focused on this topic in young or older U.S. Hispanic adults. One study, however, examined
episodic memory, future thinking, and counterfactual thinking in young and older Colombian
adults (De Brigard, Rodriguez, & Montañes, 2017). The study found that younger adults
generated more internal details across all types of mental simulations than older adults. In
contrast, older adults produced more external details. These findings suggest that some Hispanic
groups may show typical age-related episodic specificity differences in autobiographical memory
narration.
Although the work by De Brigard and colleagues (2017) addresses EAM in a Hispanic
population, it is unclear if bilingualism influences the effect of age on EAM. Hispanic adults in the
U.S. are commonly bilingual (Pew Research Center, 2004), which is thought to confer certain
cognitive benefits that may be relevant to how memory is naturally retrieved and shared with
others. For instance, bilingualism has been associated with benefits in certain aspects of
executive functioning, like inhibitory control, task switching, and attention control (Bialystok, Craik,
& Luk, 2012). Executive functions, in turn, have been associated with higher episodic specificity
in studies of EAM retrieval in young and older adults (Addis, Wong, & Schacter, 2008; Piolino et
al., 2008). This relationship raises the possibility that practice of switching languages leads to
improved attentional control and memory monitoring, both of which are essential for maintaining
the accuracy and detail of EAMs (Green & Abutalebi, 2013), especially when the retrieval goals
prioritize episodic specificity. Beyond executive functions, bilingualism allows a person to draw
Acevedo Molina-Bilingualism, aging, and memory
from two distinct sets of vocabulary. Two sets of vocabulary could enhance the ability to encode
and articulate episodic memories more precisely, leading to richer and more vivid
autobiographical recollections (Kroll, Dussias, Bogulski, & Valdes Kroff, 2012). Also, bilingual
adults often navigate different cultural frameworks, which may enhance their ability to encode and
retrieve contextually rich and socially relevant memories (Marian & Neisser, 2000). Research by
Marian and Kaushanskaya (2003) indicates that bilinguals’ narratives can shift between
individualistic and collectivist themes depending on the language in use. This suggests that
bilinguals may access a broader range of cognitive and cultural schemas during memory retrieval,
which could further enhance the episodic specificity of their EAMs. From this viewpoint, bilingual
Hispanic adults might tend to describe EAMs in more episodic detail than monolingual Hispanic
adults, as their bilingualism offers cognitive and linguistic advantages that support the richness
and precision of autobiographical memory retrieval.
The overarching goal of the present study was to advance our understanding of aging and
EAM retrieval in U.S. Hispanic adults and determine whether bilingualism influences EAM
episodic specificity in this population. We hypothesized that, consistent with findings in
predominantly non-Hispanic White samples, older Hispanic adults who are cognitively unimpaired
would recall EAMs with less specificity than their younger counterparts. Additionally, we posited
that bilingual Hispanic adults—regardless of age—would demonstrate a greater ability to recall
event-specific details compared to their monolingual peers. This would suggest that bilingualism
might enhance EAM specificity across the adult lifespan, and therefore promote the benefits of
recalling the autobiographical past in high episodic detail.
Methods
unimpaired young and middle-aged/older participants are reported in this study (50 bilingual
Hispanic adults [30 young, 20 middle-aged/older]; 50 monolingual English-speaking Hispanic
adults [30 young, 20 middle-aged/older]). Participants classified as young adults were between
Acevedo Molina-Bilingualism, aging, and memory
the ages of 18-35 and middle-aged/older adults were 50 and older. Informed consent was
provided by all participants and all study procedures were in compliance with the Institutional
Review Board of The University of Arizona.
Power analysis
An a priori power analysis conducted with G Power 3.1 evaluated the minimum sample
size to detect medium-to-large size (f = .33) group effects and interactions. We settled on this
expected effect size in light of our previous research and power analysis calculations involving
studies of cognitive aging and event specificity in EAM (Acevedo-Molina et al., 2020). This power
analysis revealed that we would have adequate power (>.80) to pass the p<.05 significance
threshold (two-tailed) if our total sample included at least 90 participants. We intentionally aimed
to surpass this required sample size and our sample sizes were settled on prior to enrolling
participants in the present study.
Procedures
The present study was largely run in a remote/virtual environment during the first 1.5 years
of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Potential participants were phone screened to determine study
eligibility, which included being Hispanic per self-report, being proficient in English, and denying
a history of psychiatric or neurological disorders. We screened for bilingualism via phone using
the Language Experience and Proficiency Questionnaire (LEAP-Q) (Marian, Blumfield, &
Kaushanskaya, 2007), a self-report tool designed to assess an individual's language history and
proficiency across different languages. Participants who rated themselves at least 7 on a 1–10
scale in speaking, understanding, and reading in both English and Spanish were placed in the
bilingual group. Hispanic adults who reported knowing English only or who rated themselves 6 or
characteristics for the bilingual Hispanic individuals obtained via self-report using the LEAP-Q.
During the initial phone screen, we administered the Telephone Interview for Cognitive
Status (TICS). Participants had to score 26 or higher on the TICS to be included in the study
Acevedo Molina-Bilingualism, aging, and memory
(Manly et al., 2011). This cutoff was selected based on work by Manly and colleagues, which
showed that this cutoff maximized sensitivity and specificity between normal cognition and mild
cognitive impairment in Hispanic adults and non-Hispanic White older adults (Manly et al., 2011).
The consent process was done using REDCap econsent. Following enrollment, participants
received instructions for their video conference appointment. Bilingual participants were also
asked to complete the rest of the LEAP-Q (we asked question #3 as part of the screen). On a
separate day, all participants completed a standard Autobiographical Interview (Levine et al.,
2002). Twelve young bilingual Hispanic adults completed the study in person prior to halting in-
person research at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The rest of the participants completed
the study over Zoom for Health.
Autobiographical Interview
The Autobiographical Interview (Levine et al., 2002) is a well-established method for
assessing EAM. Participants are asked to retrieve unique event memories (i.e., EAMs) from
different time periods and describe them in detail. For monolingual participants, a total of 5
memories were retrieved. For bilingual participants, 10 memories were retrieved, one in English
and one in Spanish for each of the 5 time periods (order of Spanish and English was
counterbalanced across bilingual participants). The narratives were audio recorded and later
transcribed. Transcribed narratives were separated into individual details, and each detail was
scored as an “internal” detail, meaning episodic (e.g., description of the event, sensory details
specific to the event), or an “external” detail (e.g. semantic or factual statements, repetitions, or
other details not specific to the event), according to the standard Autobiographical Interview
protocol. Because the language in which instructions are provided may influence memory
retrieval, for the bilingual group, the instructions were provided in the language with which the
memory would be narrated in.
Detail Scoring Reliability
Acevedo Molina-Bilingualism, aging, and memory
Memories generated by bilingual and monolingual Hispanic participants were scored by two
raters who were trained on the Autobiographical Interview materials. Each person scored half of
the narratives. Inter-rater reliability for detail scoring was calculated based on a random selection
of ten young adults and ten older adults (20% of the total number of Hispanic participants), which
were scored by both raters. Inter-rater reliability, for total details, internal details, and external
details was good to excellent (Cronbach’s α’s range = .83 to .93).
Statistical Analyses
All analyses were conducted in JASP (Version 0.16.4). All graphs were created using
GraphPad Prism version 9.4.1 for Mac OS X (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA,
ww.graphpad.com). Separate one-way ANOVAs were used to calculate differences between the
post-hoc tests using the Holm correction. To determine if EAM episodic specificity is sensitive to
age in cognitively typical Hispanic adults, and to reveal whether bilingualism influences EAM
episodic specificity on its own or in the context of age, we ran a two (Bilingualism Status: Bilingual
Hispanic vs Monolingual Hispanic) x two (Age: Young vs. Middle-aged/Older) x two (Detail:
average internal vs. external per memory) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Education was
added as a covariate, given that young monolingual participants had significantly less education
than all groups, as reported in the Results. For all analyses, significant effects were followed up
with relevant post-hoc tests using the Holm correction. Data from the bilingual participants
reported in the analysis are from memories retrieved in English. A separate analysis using data
from memories retrieved in Spanish by the bilingual participants yielded comparable results.
These analyses are reported in the Supplemental Materials section.

Discussion
The primary goal of this study was to examine the relationship between bilingualism, age,
and EAM, in a sample of U.S. Hispanic adults. The findings revealed an age-related decrease in
episodic detail generation among Hispanic participants, with no significant difference in non-
episodic detail between age groups. Notably, young bilingual participants demonstrated higher
episodic specificity compared to their monolingual counterparts, an effect that was not observed
between older bilingual and monolingual participants.
The findings of the present study demonstrate that young bilingual Hispanic adults exhibit
a heightened level of episodic detail in their EAMs compared to their monolingual counterparts,
supporting the concept of a ‘bilingual advantage’ in memory that has been well-documented
across various cognitive domains (Bialystok, Craik, & Freedman, 2007; Bak, 2016). The effect of
Acevedo Molina-Bilingualism, aging, and memory
bilingualism in younger cohorts underscores the potential cognitive benefits of bilingualism in
enhancing everyday, personal memory storage and retrieval during the earlier stages of
adulthood. By controlling for educational attainment, our findings suggest that the EAM advantage
is not merely an artifact of educational differences but instead reflects a genuine cognitive
enhancement linked to the fluent acquisition and use of more than one language.
There are several potential reasons why bilingualism might lead to an episodic specificity
advantage in EAM. As noted in the Introduction, bilingualism has been linked to higher executive
functioning (Bialystok, 2009; Bialystok et al., 2012), which could contribute to describing personal
life events in richer, specific detail, especially in individuals who have access to two vocabularies.
Executive functions, for example, involve skills such as planning, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory
control, which can help individuals organize and elaborate on their memories more effectively
(Conway, 2000; Moscovitch & Winocur, 2002). Additionally, higher attentional control, which may
be a part of executive functioning, allows individuals to focus on relevant details and ignore
distractions, enhancing the vividness and specificity of their memories (Gjorgieva et al., 2022).
Given that the task instructions of the Autobiographical Interview (Levine et al., 2002) encourage
participants to describe event-specific details, individuals with higher attentional control may be
better able to focus on this goal and generate more episodic details accordingly.
Another possible explanation for this finding is the impact of culture on autobiographical
memory. Cultural norms significantly influence how memories are valued, recalled, and narrated,
(Park & Huang, 2010; Ji & Yap, 2016; Wang & Ross, 2007; Ross & Wang, 2010; Stone et al.,
2006; Gallo et al., 2009). Individuals from collectivist cultures focus on relational and communal
aspects in their narratives, whereas individuals from individualistic cultures emphasize personal
achievements and experiences (Wang, 2003, 2004; Wang & Brockmeier, 2002; Wang & Ross,
2005). In the context of our study, Hispanic individuals living in the U.S. navigate between the
collectivist cultural norms of their heritage and the individualistic values prevalent in American
society. Indeed, research suggests that bilingual individuals often achieve higher degrees of
Acevedo Molina-Bilingualism, aging, and memory
biculturalism compared to their monolingual counterparts (Nguyen & Benet-Martínez, 2013;
Grosjean, 2015). We theorize that bicultural individuals develop unique cognitive skills and
competencies, allowing them to effectively blend and organize their cultural identities (Szymanski
& Kalra, 2019; McCarty et al., 2023). These skills may facilitate the integration of diverse cultural
perspectives into their autobiographical narratives, enriching the detail and richness of such
memories (Nguyen & Rule, 2020). Therefore, we hypothesize that bilingualism and biculturalism
significantly shape the autobiographical memories of Hispanic individuals in the US, adding layers
of detail and depth less commonly found in monolingual narratives.
Notably, the bilingual advantage did not manifest in the older adult group, as there was no
significant difference in episodic or non-episodic (i.e., internal or external) detail generation
between middle-aged/older bilingual and monolingual Hispanic adults. This result aligns with
literature that has failed to find a consistent bilingual advantage in older age groups (Paap &
Greenberg, 2013; Bak, 2016; Kousaie & Phillips, 2012; de Bruin, Treccani, and Sala, 2015).
Although some studies support the notion that bilingualism contributes to cognitive reserve
(Bialystok, Craik, & Freedman, 2007; Gold et al., 2013), the effects of bilingualism may not be
sufficient to overcome some cognitive changes associated with typical aging (Park & Reuter-
Lorenz, 2009; Hedden & Gabrieli, 2004). Furthermore, it is important to consider that older adults
may have distinct narrative goals compared to younger adults, which might not emphasize
episodic detail. Grilli and Sheldon (2023) propose that older adults tend to focus more on the "gist"
of autobiographical events rather than specific details. This shift toward gist memory is
hypothesized to not merely be a consequence of cognitive decline but rather also reflective of
adaptive changes in priorities and motivational factors that come with aging. Older adults may
prioritize conveying the broader meaning and emotional tone of their experiences, aligning with
their social and identity-related goals. This narrative shift could explain the absence of a bilingual
advantage in episodic specificity among older adults, as memory strategies may be geared toward
general rather than specific details, negating the benefit that bilingualism might have provided.
Acevedo Molina-Bilingualism, aging, and memory
Heterogeneity in bilingual characteristics might have also contributed to the present
findings. The impact of a second language may be influenced by numerous factors that vary in
older adults who are bilingual, such as immigration history, age of acquisition, frequency of
language use, and sociocultural context (Birdsong, 2006). Moreover, some older adults
experience prolonged periods of language attrition, where either use of their first or second
language decreased over time, potentially weakening the cognitive benefits associated with
bilingualism (Schmid & Keijzer, 2009). Additionally, socioeconomic factors might play a role in the
degree to which bilingualism can support cognitive health in older adults. For example, older
adults from lower socioeconomic backgrounds might not have had the same opportunities or
support systems that could reinforce the cognitive advantages of bilingualism, thus impacting the
overall efficacy of bilingualism as a cognitive reserve (Calvo et al., 2016). Lastly, individual
differences in cognitive reserve capacity and resilience to cognitive decline might interact with
bilingualism in complex ways, making it challenging to isolate the specific contributions of
bilingualism to cognitive health in aging populations.
In addition to highlighting the dynamic interaction between bilingualism, aging, and EAM,
the present study motivates several additional areas for future investigation. Expanding these
studies to include diverse ethnic and linguistic groups, and employing longitudinal designs, would
help determine the generalizability of the bilingual advantage in memory and its evolution over
time (Luk & Bialystok, 2013). Moreover, our study did not include a formal measure of
acculturation and research suggests that acculturation can impact neuropsychological
performance (Mendoza et al., 2022; Alan et al., 2022; Rodríguez et al., 2022). Future studies
should also explore the impact of lifestyle factors (e.g., diet, alcohol intake, smoking, physical
activity, etc.) on memory, as these have been shown to differ in Hispanic adults relative to
monolingual Non-Hispanic White adults (Fernandez, 2021) and influence memory (Celik et al.,
2020; Raizada & Kishiyama, 2010). Additionally, future studies should use objective measures to
determine bilingualism/monolingualism in their samples. Although the LEAP-Q provides a
Acevedo Molina-Bilingualism, aging, and memory
standardized approach to gathering historical language exposure data, it relies on the accuracy
of retrospective self-reports, which can be susceptible to recall bias (Umanath & Marsh, 2014).
For instance, it is important to note that age of acquisition estimates in our study are based on
participants’ responses to a questionnaire, which used a scale to approximate the age at which
languages were acquired. This methodological consideration should be taken into account when
interpreting the age of language acquisition as it reflects participants' earliest linguistic memories
rather than precise timelines. Lastly, in our study, the classification of participants as monolingual
may not fully capture the nuanced spectrum of language exposure. It is possible that some
participants categorized as monolingual Hispanic may have had incidental exposure to another
language, which is common given educational curriculums and community interactions (Bice &
Kroll, 2019). Implementing more detailed assessments of language exposure and use could refine
our understanding of monolingualism and enhance the clarity of the observed effects of
bilingualism on memory (Bialystok, Craik, & Luk, 2008; Grosjean, 1992).
In conclusion, our study contributes valuable insights into the effects of bilingualism and
aging on autobiographical memory among Hispanic adults in the U.S. Although our findings
confirm the presence of an age-related decline in the specificity of EAM among U.S. Hispanic
adults, consistent with previous research in predominantly non-Hispanic White samples, the
impact of bilingualism presents a more complex picture. Our results suggest a bilingual advantage
in EAM among young, but not older, U.S. Hispanic adults. This study highlights the importance of
including diverse linguistic and cultural perspectives in memory research to enhance our
understanding of how bilingualism and cultural factors interact with cognitive aging.
