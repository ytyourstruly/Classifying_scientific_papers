LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
Abstract
Lifespan developmental theories suggest age-related shifts in motivation, cognition, emotion
regulation, and stressor experience lead to changes in mean levels of negative and positive affect
across the lifespan. The present research used coordinated data analysis to examine mean-level
affective trajectories in 186,752 participants ranging from 11-104 years old across 14 longitudinal
studies. Random-effects models were used to estimate meta-analytic effect sizes. On average,
negative affect decreased until early older adulthood, then remained stable throughout older
adulthood. Meanwhile, positive affect remained stable across most of the younger and middle-
aged adult lifespan, before starting its descent in later middle-aged adulthood and continuing to
decline throughout older adulthood. Studies with older samples showed a clearer flattening effect
of negative affect and steeper decline of positive affect in late-life relative to younger samples.
These findings suggest that lifespan developmental affect trajectories are nuanced and not a direct
inverse of each other.

LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
Lifespan Trajectories of Negative and Positive Affect: A Coordinated Analysis of 14
Longitudinal Studies
Negative and positive affect are core components of well-being and have wide-reaching
implications for psychological and physical health (Boehm, 2018; Brown, Chorpita, & Barlow,
1998; Chida & Steptoe, 2008; Cross, Hofschneider, Grimm, & Pressman, 2018; Diener, Suh,
Lucas, & Smith, 1999; Fredrickson, 2004). Lifespan developmental theories suggest that mean
levels of negative and positive affect change as people age, though empirical evidence supporting
the trajectories of these age-based changes is mixed. Understanding general age-related changes
in negative and positive affect has been of interest to researchers for decades (e.g., Charles et al.,
2001; Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998), as identifying trajectories can point to when in the lifespan an
individual may be most vulnerable to experiencing poor affective well-being.
Lifespan Developmental Theories of Age-Related Changes in Negative and Positive Affect
As age-related shifts in motivation, cognition, emotion regulation, and stressor experience
are possible, affect has been suggested to display mean-level changes over the life course
(Carstensen, 2006; Carstensen & Mikels, 2005; Graham et al., 2006; Labouvie-Vief, 2003). For
example, Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (SST; Carstensen 1993, 2006; 2021; Carstensen,
Isaacowitz, & Charles, 1999) posits that, as people age, they experience a motivational shift from
pursuing future-oriented goals to prioritizing the present moment. Consequently, younger and
middle-aged adults may sacrifice their current affective well-being in the pursuit of future-
oriented goals, while older adults may avoid negative emotional experiences to prioritize their
current affective well-being. Central to this theory is the belief that negative affect decreases later
in the lifespan as older adults prioritize less negative emotion-inducing experiences.
In line with the age-related change pattern suggested by the SST, the Strength and
Vulnerability Integration (SAVI) theoretical framework (Charles, 2010) argues that people accrue
LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
knowledge and experience across the lifespan that may make it easier for them to down-regulate
negative affect and up-regulate positive affect, implying decreases in negative affect and
increases in positive as people age. However, this framework also notes that these are simply the
mean-level trajectories and that some older adults may not follow these trends based on
potentially negative events or environmental contexts that they cannot avoid. As such, the
presumed negative and positive affect trajectories of SAVI generally align with SST while also
noting the likelihood of individual differences in aging-based change.
Dynamic Integration Theory (DIT) proposes a similar lifespan trajectory of negative and
positive affect as these other frameworks (Labouvie-Vief, 2003). According to the DIT, the
developmental tasks of younger and middle adulthood contribute to increasing levels of affective
complexity. Later, older adults compensate for declining cognitive resources by prioritizing less
cognitively demanding positive emotions and curbing the integration of more cognitively-
demanding negative emotions. Consistent with DIT, evidence has been found that older adults
attend to positive rather than negative stimuli more than younger adults (Carstensen & Mikels,
2005; Charles & Carstensen, 2008; Kennedy, Mather, & Carstensen, 2004), helping older adults
maintain higher levels of positive affect and lower levels of negative affect.
Taken together, the majority of lifespan theories of affective development predict age-
related increases in positive affect and age-related decreases in negative affect. Alternatively,
based on Selection-Optimization-Compensation (SOC) theory (Baltes, 1997; Baltes & Baltes,
1990), this pattern may decelerate or reverse in latest life, when cognitive and physical health
decline and personal losses increase. Thus, these findings would suggest a quadratic rather than
linear form of change. Put differently, negative affect may decrease and positive affect may
increase with age-related experience, expertise, and motivations (Charles, 2010; Labouvie-Vief,
LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
2003), up until a change point where age-related health declines and losses could reverse this
pattern.
Empirical Evidence for Age-Related Changes in Negative and Positive Affect
Empirical evidence is generally consistent with age-related decreases in negative affect
(Charles et al., 2001; Grühn et al., 2010; Hudson et al., 2016; Jebb et al., 2020; Joiner et al., 2018;
Kessler & Staudinger, 2009; Mak & Schneider, 2022; Shi et al., 2009; Stacey & Gatz, 1991;
Windsor & Anstey, 2010; Windsor et al., 2013), although not all studies have observed this
pattern (e.g., Kunzmann et al., 2000). Moreover, some studies have found evidence that this
decline in negative affect slows or reverses in late life (Carstensen et al., 2011; Griffin et al.,
2006; Lachman et al., 2015; Schilling et al., 2013). Indeed, a recent traditional meta-analysis
based on 129 unique samples with a total of 65,274 participants found that negative affect
typically decreases until people’s 60s, and then begins to increase (Buecker et al., 2023).
Evidence for age-related trajectories of positive affect is more mixed, with studies finding
no association between positive affect and age (Carstensen et al., 2011; Grühn et al., 2010; Shi et
al., 2009), positive associations between positive affect and age (Kessler & Staundinger, 2009;
Windsor et al., 2013), negative associations between positive affect and age (Griffin et al., 2006;
Hudson et al., 2016; Jebb et al., 2020; Kunzmann et al., 2000; Stacey & Gatz, 1991; Schilling et
al., 2013), and nonlinear relationships between positive affect and age (Charles, 2010; Gana et
al., 2015; Joiner et al., 2018; Lachman et al., 2015; Mak & Schneider, 2022; Windsor et al.,
2013). Some studies have found differences when comparing cross-sectional and longitudinal
methods within the same sample (Charles et al., 2023; Hansen & Slagsvold, 2012; Joiner et al.,
2018), and meta-analytic work based on 128 unique samples with a total of 88,162 participants
has found a linear decrease in positive affect starting in childhood (Buecker et al., 2023). In sum,
research is highly mixed regarding how experiences of positive affect shift as individuals age.
LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
The Benefits of Coordinated Data Analysis
A recent meta-analysis found, across 65,274 participants for negative affect and 88,162
participants for positive affect, general decreases in both negative and positive affect across most
of the lifespan (Buecker et al., 2023). Using individual participant data from 14 longitudinal
studies and over 186,000 participants, the current study takes a complementary approach to this
meta-analysis in a few primary ways. First, the primary difference between coordinated data
analysis (CDA) and traditional meta-analysis is that CDA uses individual participant data and
includes the full body of results in the meta-analytic estimate, whereas traditional meta-analysis
uses aggregated effect size estimates across studies. Traditional meta-analyses suffer from the file
drawer problem because nonsignificant findings are less likely to be submitted and published.
Due to this, age findings for positive and negative affect may have been overestimated in the
published literature. Second, because the previous meta-analysis did not use individual
participant data, the authors had to create 12 age categories starting at age nine and going up to
80+. Given age is a naturally continuous variable, more accurately and precisely evaluating the
lifespan developmental trajectories of affect requires modeling age continuously. Based on
previous theoretical and empirical evidence, affect is likely to change in a quadratic form;
however, individual participant data are necessary to test nonlinear change trajectories of affect
more precisely (i.e., to treat age continuously instead of in discrete categories).
Modeling the trajectories of the individual participant data also allows for modeling these
trajectories quadratically and the exploration of the extent of individual differences in change
trajectories across datasets. Finally, the inclusion criteria in the meta-analysis by Buecker et al.
(2023) specified studies must have positive affect or negative affect, with many studies only
including one or the other. Differences in findings for positive and negative affect in the meta-
analysis could be driven by sample and study specific characteristics, rather than nuances tied to
LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
negative and positive affect themselves. Thus, a strength of the current study is our ability to
directly compare positive and negative affect trajectories and to evaluate their between- and
within-person associations throughout the aging process.
The Current Study
The current study uses a coordinated data analysis approach, which allows for the
harmonization of variables across different samples to estimate a meta-analytic effect for the
question of interest (e.g., Beauchamp et al., 2022; Graham et al., 2020; Jenkins et al., 2022; Kelly
et al., 2016; Piccinin et al., 2012; Yoneda et al., 2022). By using individual participant data from
multiple samples, we are better able to ensure that all results are included in our meta-analytic
estimate regardless of the direction or significance of the effects. Moreover, in traditional meta-
analyses, investigators are limited by the analytic decisions made by the individual study authors,
with studies often using different analytic approaches and including different covariates and
parameter constraints when drawing their conclusions. The benefit of CDA is that, while we are
still limited by the study design differences in the individual datasets, we can hold constant all
analytic decisions, such as the constraints of parameters and the inclusion of random effects.
Similar to a traditional meta-analysis, but while using individual participant data,
coordinated data analyses also allow for the exploration of study-level moderators. With findings
conflicting for age-related affect trajectories across studies, evaluating potential methodological
and sample characteristics could shed light onto when and for whom negative and positive affect
changes. The current project evaluated four study-level moderators: average baseline age, country
in which the study was based, the average number of measurement occasions, and affect scale
used. Because these samples have differing age ranges, we evaluated whether trajectories differed
based on the average baseline age of the sample. Also, research has highlighted that certain
aspects of well-being trajectories may be in part tied to country of residence (Blanchflower,
LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
2021), so the current study will explore whether the linear and quadratic trajectories of affect
differ based on country of residence. As the current project has six samples from the United
States and eight from other countries (i.e., two from Australia, two from Germany, two from
Netherlands, two from Sweden), this project is limited to comparing trajectories based on
residency in the United States or not. On the methodological front, studies differed on numbers of
measurement occasions and affect scales used. Though traditional meta-analytic work has
indicated these methodological differences do not explain heterogeneity across studies (Buecker
et al., 2023), we included these moderators to investigate whether this was the case when using
individual participant data.
To address inconsistent findings in previous work, the present research used 14
longitudinal datasets to examine mean-level trajectories of positive and negative affect across the
adolescent and adult lifespan in a coordinated data analysis (Beauchamp et al., 2022; Graham et
al., 2020; Jenkins et al., 2022; Kelly et al., 2016; Piccinin et al., 2012; Yoneda et al., 2022). The
conceptual harmonization of different longitudinal studies using the coordinated data analysis
approach allowed 14 independent opportunities for conceptual replication, while also accounting
for differences in country of data collection, measurement type, and sample characteristics.
Method
The current study used 14 longitudinal datasets, including publicly available and archived
datasets as well as datasets found through the Integrative Analysis of Longitudinal Studies on
Aging and Dementia (IALSA) network, maelstrom.org, and introduced through the review
process. The main inclusion criteria were (1) at least three waves of negative and positive affect
given the necessity of multiple waves to appropriately tease apart age-based changes (e.g.,
Galambos et al., 2021), and (2) the data were accessible to the study team. Thus, we included 14
LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
independent longitudinal datasets with a combined sample size of 186,572 across datasets. See

Ageing (ALSA) began in 1992 out of Adelaide, South Australia with participants who were at
least 65 years old (Luszcz et al., 2016). Participants completed the CES-D over varying periods
of time to gauge their negative and positive affect over the past seven days, with a total of eight
measurement occasions over a 22-year period. A total of 795 participants (Age: M = 76.16, SD =
5.52, range = 65-94 at the analytic baseline; 59% female) completed at least one measurement of
affect. There were 648 individuals who completed at least three measurements and 382 who
completed at least four.

The German Aging Study. The German Aging Study (Deustches Zentrum für
Altersfragen; DEAS) is a nationally representative longitudinal panel study out of Germany that
began in 1996 (Klaus et al., 2017; Research Data Centre of the German Centre of Gerontology,
2017, 2022); Simonson et al., 2023). Participants completed the 20-item version of the Positive
and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) (Watson et al., 1988) in 1996, 2002, 2008, 2011, 2014,
2017, and 2020/2021 to gauge their positive and negative affect at the present moment. A total of
17,088 participants (Age: M = 59.70, SD = 11.44, range = 40-93 at the analytic baseline; 49%
female) completed at least one measurement of affect. There were 5,885 individuals who
completed at least three measurements and 2,880 who completed at least four.

core, v38.1, 2023) (Brücker et al., 2014; Brücker et al., 2017; Goebel et al., 2019). Participants
completed a modified 4-item affective well-being measure developed in the current sample
(Schimmack et al., 2002; Schimmack et al., 2008; Schimmack, 2009). Every year from 2007 until
2021, participants responded to four items that gauged their negative and positive affect in the
past four weeks. A total of 60,132 participants (Age: M = 45.39, SD = 16.92, range = 17-98 at the
analytic baseline; 54% female) completed at least one measurement of affect. There were 39,399
individuals who completed at least three measurements and 33,286 who completed at least four.
Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia. The Household, Income and
Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey is a longitudinal panel study conducted by the
Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbourne
out of Australia that began in 2001. Participants completed the 5-item mental health section from
the SF-36 questionnaire (Butterworth & Crosier, 2004; Ware et al., 2001) to gauge their positive
and negative affect in the past four weeks. Every year since 2001, participants responded to these
LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
items. A total of 32,845 participants (Age: M = 37.56, SD = 17.45, range = 14-99 at the analytic
baseline; 53% female) completed at least one measurement of affect. There were 24,320
individuals who completed at least three measurements and 22,167 who completed at least four.
The Health and Retirement Study. The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a
nationally representative longitudinal panel study out of the United States that began in 1992
(Juster & Suzman, 1995; Sonnega et al., 2014). Half of the sample completed an affect
assessment in 2008, and the other half of the sample completed it in 2010. Every four years from
their personal start date, each group filled out an affect survey again. During the time of analyses,
the former has up to four measurement occasions while the latter has up to three. Participants
completed the PANAS to report how frequently they had experienced different negative and
positive emotions over the past 30 days. A total of 22,147 participants (Age: M = 64.63, SD =
10.48, range = 18-101 at the analytic baseline; 60% female) completed at least one measurement
of affect. There were 8,168 individuals who completed at least three measurements and 1,811
who completed at least four.
The Longitudinal Aging Study of Amsterdam. The Longitudinal Aging Study of
Amsterdam (LASA) began in 1992 out of Amsterdam in the Netherlands with participants who
were 55 to 85 years old (Hoogendijk et al., 2016), sample from various geographical parts of the
country and from urban and more rural areas to ensure national representativeness. Participants
completed the CES-D every three years to gauge their negative and positive affect over the past
seven days, with a total of seven measurement occasions over a 20-year period. A total of 4,109
participants (Age: M = 66.43, SD = 8.31, range = 54-86 at the analytic baseline; 55% female)
completed at least one measurement of affect. There were 2,631 individuals who completed at
least three measurements and 2,131 who completed at least four.

Measures
Positive Affect and Negative Affect. All studies assessed at least three waves of negative
and positive affect. Seven studies used the CES-D to assess affect (i.e., ADDH, ALSA, LASA,
LSOG, OCTO, SATSA, WLS; N = 30,255), four studies used PANAS to assess affect (i.e.,
DEAS, HRS, LISS, NAS; N = 56,499), and the final studies each used different measures (i.e.,
HILDA used SF-36 mental health subscale, MIDUS used MIDI, GSOEP used SOEP-affective
well-being measure). Between studies, the versions of the measures for the CES-D and PANAS
varied. For example, ADDH used a 9-item version and ALSA used a 20-item version of the CES-
D; DEAS had participants rate the PANAS items based on the current moment, and HRS had
them rate it based on the past 30 days.
Across studies, affect was coded so higher scores represented more frequent experiences
of negative affect and more frequent experiences of positive affect. Because the Likert scales
differed across studies, all scales were percent of maximum possible (POMP) scored then divided
by 10. The resulting scores ranged from 0 (the minimum score possible) to 10 (the maximum
score possible). In other words, if a Likert scale ranged from 1 (never) to 5 (all the time), 1 would
used to assess affect within each study. In the cases where we had raw items for these measures,
Age. Age was used as the time metric to model affect trajectories. Age was centered at 65
years in each study, with the exception of ADDH and OCTO. Because the maximum age in
LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
ADDH was younger than 65, age was centered at 20. Likewise, because the minimum age in
OCTO was older than 65, age was centered at 90. Given that the age ranges and age scaling in
ADDH and OCTO were different from the other samples, ADDH and OCTO were not included
in the meta-analytic estimates. If age was missing at a time point during which a participant
reported affect, their age was imputed based on the sum of the number of years between their
baseline age report and that timepoint. For all samples, age was divided by 10 so 1-unit
represented one decade.
Sex. All studies assessed baseline sex dichotomously, wherein 0 = male and 1 = female.
Because all participants in NAS identified as males, NAS was not included in analyses where sex
was a predictor.
Attrition Analyses
Attrition analyses were used to evaluate whether there were differences in sex, age, or
affect for individuals who participated in less than three (study discontinuers) versus at least three
waves (study continuers) of data collection. Based on a chi-square test, people who identified as
male were significant more likely to discontinue study participation than people who identified as
based on sex for ALSA, DEAS, GSOEP, LISS, OCTO, or SATSA. Based on an independent

study discontinuers had significantly lower positive affect than study continuers in 9 of the 14

more likely to stay in the study if they identified as female, were older, had lower negative affect,
and had higher positive affect.
Analytic Plan
Analyses were performed in R 4.4.0 (R Core Team, 2024) using the lmer() function from
the lme4 package (Bates et al., 2015). All cleaning, analytic, and meta-analytic scripts can found
of .01 were used to determine significance due to the large within-study sample sizes.
Multilevel Models for Affect Trajectories
Each dataset was arranged by nesting affect assessments within persons, thereby allowing
within-person change in affect for each individual to be modeled. The multilevel models consider
all datapoints, including respondents with only one measurement occasion of affect. All models
were estimated using Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation. Age was used as the time variable
to estimate affect trajectories in the current study. All models were conducted for both negative
and positive affect, so the term “affect” will be used in describing the following formulas. Level
1 will refer to time ( ) and Level 2 will refer to person ( ).

Meta-analyses
To summarize the average effects across studies, we used random-effects models to
estimate meta-analytic effect sizes for the intercept-only, linear change, and quadratic change
models, as well as sex by linear age interaction models. Each meta-analysis included an overall
effect (weighted by total number of observations), with corresponding standard errors/confidence
intervals, as well as estimates of heterogeneity (I2, Q) (Borenstein, Higgins, Hedges, & Rothstein,
2017). We used the significance test of the Q statistic to guide our decision to test and report the
results of study-level moderation analyses. For statistically heterogeneous main effects, we tested
four study-level moderators: average baseline age (centered at age 65), country that the study was
based in (1 = United States; 0 = non-United States), affect scale used (1 = CES-D; 0 = PANAS,
MIDI, SF-36, SOEP-affect), and the total number of measurement occasions (centered at three
waves).
ADDH and OCTO were excluded from meta-analyses because they had different age
ranges that did not overlap with the age centering of the other 12 studies. Additionally, if a study
was not included in a specific analysis because it did not meet inclusion criteria (e.g., NAS for
the sex analyses), it was not included in the meta-analyses.
Additional Analyses
To better understand the connection between negative and positive affect, the statsBy()
function from the psych package (Revelle, 2019) was used to calculate the correlation between
negative and positive affect at the between- and within-person level. The between-person
correlations represent how average levels of negative affect for individuals across the length of
the study were associated with average levels of positive affect for individuals across the length
of the study. The within-person correlations represent how changes in negative affect at a given
LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
time point relative to one’s average negative affect levels are associated with changes in positive
affect at that same time point relative to one’s average positive affect levels.
Moreover, as a measurement-based sensitivity analysis that was requested during the
review process, all random-effect models conducted to estimate meta-analytic effect sizes were
reconducted excluding the seven samples that used the CES-D. By including these additional
analyses, we were able to compare how the meta-analytic estimates for the linear and quadratic
models changed when excluding studies that used the CES-D to assess affect.

Negative Affect
Intercept Only Model.
The ICCs from the intercept-only model for negative affect ranged across the 14 samples
affect ranged from 30% to 64% at the between-person level. Across studies, ADDH had the least
amount of between-person variability while SATSA had the most between-person variability.
The remainder of variability in negative affect is a combination of true within-person variability
LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
and variance due to measurement error. These intercept-only models suggest that some
individuals generally experience more or less negative affect on average, but that individuals also
vary in their negative affect experiences over time (in some studies more than others), setting the
foundation to evaluate within-person change.

Linear Growth Model.
The linear growth model tested whether there were mean-level changes in negative affect
across the lifespan. In preliminary analyses, we report results from the models that included fixed
models with versus without random slopes for each sample. Only OCTO did not have
significantly better fit with the inclusion of random slopes for negative affect (p = .048).

Four study-level moderators were included to account for heterogeneity among studies:
average baseline age, country, scale, and number of measurement occasions. There were no
significant differences in negative affect trajectories based on studies having a higher baseline
age (B = 0.01, 95% CI [0.00, 0.01], p = .018), more measurement occasions (B = 0.00, 95% CI
[0.02, -0.02], p = .821), residing in the United States (B = -0.14, 95% CI [-0.32, 0.04], p = .121),
or the affect scale used (B = 0.19, 95% CI [0.02, 0.35], p = .025).
Within Study Differences. The final aspect of these analyses considered individual
differences in negative affect trajectories within studies. When comparing fixed slope and
random slope linear models, all studies showed significant variability in random slopes (p <
.006), except for OCTO (p = .048). This means that there were individual differences in average
model comparison information). The correlation between the random intercepts and random
slopes ranged from -0.43 to 0.63. Higher levels of negative affect at age 65 were associated with
a greater change in negative affect in four samples: GSOEP, HILDA, LISS, and LSOG,
suggesting potential regression to the mean (Campbell & Kenny, 1999). However, higher levels
of negative affect at age 65 were associated with less change in negative affect in the other nine
samples: ADDH, ALSA, DEAS, HRS, LASA, MIDUS, NAS, SATSA, and WLS.
LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
We evaluated sex as a person-level factor that may partially explain individual differences
models. The meta-analytic summary for average sex differences suggested that women scored
significantly higher on negative affect then men across samples (B = 0.33, 95% CI [0.20, 0.45], p
< .001), though there was also significant heterogeneity (𝐼 = 97.18, Q = 416.39, df = 10, p = <
.001). Within individual studies, women reported significantly higher negative affect than men in
all samples (𝛾 ranged from 0.18 to 0.71), except for LISS and SATSA. Finally, the meta-

analytic summary also confirmed a non-significant effect of sex on linear negative affect
trajectories (B= -0.02, 95% CI [-0.04, 0.00], p = .055), though there was significant heterogeneity
(𝐼 = 66.45, Q = 31.82, df = 10, p < .001).
Quadratic Growth Model.
Next, we tested quadratic trajectories of negative affect across the lifespan. Eight studies
met the inclusion criteria of at least four waves of affect reports to estimate quadratic growth

Overall meta-analytic effect. The meta-analysis indicated a slightly U-shaped quadratic
effect (B= 0.06, 95% CI [0.03, 0.10], p < .001), suggesting that negative affect initially decreased
throughout early adulthood and middle-aged adulthood, where it then stabilized, and remained
fairly consistent throughout older adulthood. There was also significant heterogeneity in

differences in estimates across studies. Studies with higher baseline age were more likely to have
an increase in negative affect later on ( B = 0.09, 95% CI [0.06, 0.12], p = < .001; meta-analytic
slope: B = .003, 95% CI [.001, .005], p < .001). However, number of measurement occasions (B
= -0.01, 95% CI [0.00, -0.01], p = .048), residing in the United States (B = 0.02, 95% CI [-0.06,
0.09], p = .633), and the scale used were not related to trajectories across the lifespan (B = 0.05,
95% CI [-0.02, 0.12], p = .174).
For the nine studies that showed significantly better model fit with the quadratic age term,
the patterns surrounding these quadratic changes differed across studies. ALSA, LASA, and
SATSA showed stability in negative affect from middle-aged to early older adulthood, with an
increase in negative affect later on in older adulthood. DEAS showed a decrease in negative
affect from middle-aged to older adulthood, then a stabilization in negative affect around age 80.
To varying degrees of magnitude, HILDA, HRS, LISS, LSOG, and NAS showed a decrease in
negative affect until late adulthood, followed by a later increase. For the three studies that had
better model fit with linear change, ADDH and GSOEP showed significant decline in negative
affect, while OCTO showed no significant linear change in negative affect. Additionally, model
comparisons were not made for MIDUS and WLS as they only had three waves of data; both
showed significant linear decline in negative affect.

Note. All of the following models include random intercepts and random slopes for age. Bolded
estimates represent p < .01.
Four study-level moderators were included to evaluate why findings may have differed
among studies: average baseline age, country, scale, and number of measurement occasions.
Studies with higher baseline age were associated with stronger decreases in positive affect (meta-
analytic intercept: -0.24, 95% CI [-0.34, -0.14], p = < .001; meta-analytic slope: B = -0.01, 95%
CI [-0.02, 0.00], p = .003). However, number of measurement occasions (B = 0.00, 95% CI [0.02,

scale used were not related to trajectories across the lifespan (B = -0.14, 95% CI [-0.34, 0.05], p =
.153).
Within Study Differences. The final aspect of these analyses considered individual
differences in positive affect trajectories within studies. When comparing fixed slope and random
slope linear models, all studies showed significant variability in random slopes (p < .001), except
for ALSA, MIDUS, and SATSA (p = .073, .119, and .615, respectively). This means that there
were individual differences in average positive affect and positive affect change trajectories in 11
the random intercepts and random slopes ranged from -0.36 to 0.72. Higher initial levels of
positive affect at age 65 were associated with a greater decrease in positive affect in four studies:
ADDH, HRS, LASA, and NAS, suggesting potential regression to the mean (Campbell & Kenny,
1999). However, higher initial levels of positive affect at age 65 were associated with less change
in positive affect in the other seven samples: DEAS, GSOEP, HILDA, LISS, LSOG, OCTO, and
WLS.
We evaluated sex as a person-level factor that may partially explain individual differences

models. There was no significant difference in levels of positive affect for men and women (B = -

Q = 81.00, df = 10, p < .001). Within individual studies, there was a significant difference in
positive affect based on sex in five samples: ALSA, GSOEP, HILDA, LASA, and LISS. In all
cases, women scored significantly lower than men on positive affect (𝛾 ranged from -0.75 to -
#$
0.09). Finally, the meta-analytic summary also confirmed a non-significant effect of sex on linear
positive affect trajectories (B= 0.01, 95% CI [-0.03, 0.04], p = .753), though there was significant
heterogeneity (𝐼 = 83.86, Q = 82.28, df = 10, p < .001).

Next, we tested quadratic trajectories of positive affect across the lifespan. Twelve studies

LASA, LISS, LSOG, NAS, OCTO, and SATSA. The linear trajectory showed better fit in no

affect decline (meta-analytic intercept: B = -0.18, 95% CI [-0.12, -0.25], p < .001; meta-analytic
slope: B = 0.01, 95% CI [0.02, 0.00], p < .001). However, residing in the United States (B = -
0.04, 95% CI [-0.15, 0.08], p = .536) and the scale used to assess positive affect were not related
to differences in quadratic trajectories across the lifespan (B = -0.08, 95% CI [-0.19, 0.03], p =
.136).
Though all studies showed significantly better model fit with the quadratic age term, the
patterns surrounding these quadratic changes differed across studies, with two samples showing
u-shaped trajectories. In GSOEP, positive affect in had a sharper decline in younger and middle-
aged adulthood, with the magnitude of the decline weakening later on in the lifespan. In HILDA,
positive affect showed a small increase later on in the lifespan. All other studies with at least four
waves showed some version of an inverted U-shaped curve, and of the studies with at only three
waves, MIDUS showed a significant increase in positive affect, and WLS showed no significant
change in positive affect.

Negative and Positive Affect Between- and Within-Person Associations
As an exploratory step to understand differences in negative versus positive affect
trajectories, we calculated the between- versus within-person associations between negative and
and magnitudes of these associations in a forest plot, as well as a more in-depth discussion of
these findings. Between-person correlations for negative and positive affect ranged from -0.71 to
0.00, with all samples showing a significant, negative association, except for LISS and NAS.
Within-person correlations for negative and positive affect ranged from -0.47 to 0.10, with all
samples showing a significant, negative association, except for LISS and NAS. The magnitudes
of the associations were significantly stronger at the between-person level than within-person
levels for all samples except for LISS, where there was no difference, and NAS, where the
reverse was true.

Next, we reconducted our random-effects models excluding the seven samples (N =
30,225) that used the CES-D to assess affect. This exclusion left DEAS, GSOEP, HILDA, HRS,

Results Summary
negative and positive affect show a quadratic relationship with age at the meta-analytic level. For
the 12 studies with sufficient waves to be included in the quadratic analyses, nine samples had

better model fit with the quadratic models for negative affect, and all 12 samples had better fit
with the quadratic models for positive affect, suggesting that age-based affect trajectories are
generally quadratic regardless of valence. Separate plots with the negative and positive affect

Discussion
This work evaluated trajectories of negative and positive affect across the lifespan using
14 longitudinal studies with a combined sample size of ~187,000 participants. For both negative
and positive affect, quadratic trajectories better described how affect changed as people aged
However, the inflection point of the quadratic trajectories differed based on affect valence. In line
with the Buecker et al. (2023) meta-analysis, negative affect decreased during younger adulthood,
though the current work found a different pattern for late life. On average, negative affect
declined with an inflection point (i.e., nadir) in participants’ 60s then stabilized throughout the
rest of the older adult lifespan. By contrast, positive affect remained stable until reaching an
inflection point (i.e., apex) in participants’ 40s where individuals’ positive affect begins to
decline until the end of life, which runs contrary to the linear decline found in the Buecker et al.
(2023) meta-analysis. Thus, the current findings aligned with previous traditional meta-analytic
work for young and middle-aged adulthood before diverging in older adulthood. Moreover,
despite the general pattern across samples, we still observed some inconsistencies in the
nonlinear change patterns (e.g., participants in SATSA increased in negative affect as they aged)
across the individual samples, speaking to the complexity of lifespan developmental trajectories
and unevaluated study-level and/or person-level moderators.
Implications
Findings from the current study have implications for several theoretical frameworks on
affect change over the life course. For example, SST suggests that older adults experience less
negative affect due to their choices to focus on more short-term, pro-hedonic goals (Carstensen
1993, 2006, 2021; Carstensen et al., 1999), while SAVI and DIT note that, through the accrual of
life experiences, older adults are better able to attend to positive stimuli (Charles, 2010;
Labouvie-Vief, 2003). The negative affect trajectories observed in the current study were
LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
generally consistent with these theories of adult development and aging; however, the positive
affect trajectories diverged from the predicted pattern. These differences in trajectories between
negative and positive affect could suggest crucial emotion regulation process differences that
arise in older adulthood. Though this research suggests older adults may not be as able to up-
regulate positive emotions relative to middle-aged adults, older adults indeed appear to be able to
down-regulate their negative emotions throughout older adulthood. While prior research has
emphasized that older adults attend to positive stimuli more than younger adults (Carstensen &
Mikels, 2005; Reed & Carstensen, 2012), these findings reorient this perspective by purporting
that the down-regulation or avoidance of negative emotions may be central to older adults’
emotion regulatory strengths.
Other developmental theories note that, as individuals age, they experience more losses
than gains, and thus must be more selective in the choices they make to compensate for these
respective losses (Baltes, 1997; Baltes & Baltes, 1990). In line with SST, SAVI, and DIT, but
contrary to SOC, the current study found a maintained stability of lower negative affect as people
aged even toward the end of the adult lifespan at the aggregate level, though some sample-
specific findings often still found an uptick in negative affect in late life. These differences in
lifespan developmental affect trajectories could be tied to the selection process older adults make
amid broader aging-related declines. Older age is often associated with limitations in daily
physical functioning and is sometimes associated with reliance on care partners (Marks, 1996;
Vaughan et al., 2016). This loss of independence may impact the selection process of how older
adults regulate their emotion, with research suggesting that affective declines are sharper amongst
older adults who perceive less control over their lives (Gerstorf et al., 2018). For example, there
may be fewer opportunities for individuals to select into desirable situations to increase positive
emotions.
LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
However, given the knowledge and experience accrued throughout the lifespan (Charles,
2010), they may still be better able to effectively reappraise life stressors to keep negative
emotions at bay. Notably, these processes may not be tied solely to the experience of aging, but
also the experience of feeling one’s future time become more limited (e.g., Schilling et al., 2018;
Gerstorf et al., 2008). Moreover, theoretical frameworks have emphasized that age-associated
changes are potentially a proxy for health-related changes and proximity to death (i.e., terminal
decline) (Gerstorf & Ram, 2013). This perspective could also contextualize the variability in
change trajectories across samples.
In addition, these findings reiterate the significance of a lifespan developmental
perspective for emotion processes. With previous work emphasizing the importance of
disentangling potential age-period-cohort (APC) effects (Charles et al., 2023), it is worth noting
that some of these age findings could be confounded with time or cohort effects, though the
current study did not meet the appropriate conditions to test potential APC effects given the lack
of coverage across different ages by time periods and cohorts. For example, quadratic positive
affect findings for GSOEP and HILDA were the inverse pattern of the majority of the other
samples. Participants in these studies were on average younger (e.g., compared to HRS) and used
different affect measures from samples (e.g., LISS) that started collecting affect at a similar time
point, pointing to potential explanations tied to cohorts as well as measurement. Finally, contrary
to previous cross-sectional work (e.g., Mrcozek & Kolarz, 1998), the current study found that
there were no sex differences in how negative or positive affect changed across age.
Limitations and Future Directions
There are limitations in the current work that set the foundation for valuable next steps in
the investigation of affect across the lifespan. First, while the current study benefitted from using
longitudinal methodology, participants reported their emotional experiences at each measurement
LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
occasion through retrospective questionnaires, with requested windows of reflection ranging from
“in the current moment” to the past 30 days. These types of affect questionnaires are subject to
biases and may rely on different sources of information relative to in-the-moment reports of
affective experiences (Robinson, 2002a; Robinson, 2002b). When viewing affect through the lens
of the trait-state debate, recent calls have pointed out that measuring emotions at the within-
versus between-person level likely requires a different assessment approach (Brose et al., 2020).
Moreover, with daily experiences of affect often being associated differentially with age relative
to long-term affect trajectories (Charles et al., 2023; Röcke et al., 2009), these findings may not
translate into how age is tied to experiences of emotion in daily life. In-the-moment affective
experiences are central to many conceptualizations of affective trajectories across the lifespan.
The use of measurement burst designs could address the disconnect between short- and long-term
findings. By tracking individuals’ emotions at a momentary level over many years, we would be
able to better chart actual momentary experiences of emotions as they pertain to past theoretical
mechanistic work on age-related differences in affect while evaluating whether and how people’s
short-term reports of emotions and retrospective reports of emotions diverge (or converge) as
they age.
Second, the current study was generally underpowered (k=14) to test meta-analytic
moderators (Hedges & Pigott, 2004; Hempel et al., 2013); thus, we must interpret differences
among samples with caution. Though findings were generally consistent across samples, a larger
study-sample would allow for greater power in testing moderators, as well as more opportunities
for exploring more nuanced reasons for differences in findings. For example, rather than
comparing United States samples to non-United States samples, we could evaluate differences
between specific countries or world regions. Additionally, given the current samples came from
the United States, Germany, Australia, Sweden, and Netherlands, these findings may not be
LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
generalizable to non-Western cultures or less educated, wealthy samples. Increasing the
representation of large-scale, publicly available longitudinal datasets that assess affect in non-
WEIRD (Henrich et al., 2010) countries would help solidify what lifespan developmental
changes in negative and positive affect likely look like as individuals age more holistically.
Third, one challenge with the coordinated data analysis approach is balancing precision
with inclusivity (Graham et al., 2022). With only four samples using the classic PANAS measure
(i.e., DEAS, LISS, HRS, NAS), the decision was made for greater inclusion of negative and
positive emotions to increase both study-level power as well as representation of different ages
across different countries. However, this came at the cost of precise measurement of affect. The
operationalization and measurement of a construct should be driven by its definition (Flake &
Fried, 2020). The current study used the CES-D, a measure that assesses constructs beyond
discrete positive and negative emotions (i.e., assesses depressed affect, positive activity, somatic
activity, interpersonal functioning; Radloff et al., 1977). For example, though the CES-D captures
experiences of emotions (e.g., “I felt sad”; “I was scared”), this measure also reflects both
cognitive (e.g., “I worried about things I normally don’t worry about”) and behavioral (e.g., “I
cried”) aspects of emotional experience and expression.
Interestingly, in sensitivity analyses in which samples that used the CES-D were excluded,
quadratic results for negative affect remained the same while quadratic results for positive affect
changed. These findings align with those from previous traditional meta-analytic work which
found no measurement-based differences in affect trajectories (Buecker et al., 2023). This may
point to the negative emotional experiences across these measures being more consistent in how
they are experienced as people age. Alternatively, this could simply be an artifact of
measurement given all affect measures (excluding the PANAS) had more negatively-valenced
than positively-valenced items, thus were capturing positive affect less holistically (and perhaps
LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
less consistently). Additionally, with many of the current samples providing only aggregate affect
scores instead of individual measure items, we were unable to test longitudinal measurement
invariance. Strict longitudinal measurement invariance ensures that the loadings of the items, the
variances, of the items, and the associations between the variances of the items on a latent
variable are consistent over time (Liu et al., 2016). Without establishing this, we are unable to
disentangle trajectories in negative and positive affect attributed to aging from age-related
changes in the measurement of affect itself.
Finally, the current study focused on two components of well-being: negative and positive
affect. Previous research has found that age-based differences in affect extends beyond the
valence of emotions to the levels of arousal (i.e., activation levels) tied to those emotions. Some
findings suggesting that older adults have more frequent experiences of low arousal positive
emotions than younger adults but may not differ in low arousal negative emotions (Kessler &
Staudinger, 2009; Mak & Schneider, 2021). Thus, a more comprehensive assessment of affect
tied to the level of activity of the discrete emotion may further unveil age-based changes.
Moreover, well-being is a broad construct that includes cognitive evaluations, like life
satisfaction and sense of purpose, and social experiences, such as social connectedness and
loneliness (Willroth, 2022). Though there have been some theoretical and empirical endeavors
into understanding how other elements of psychosocial well-being may change with age (Baird et
al., 2010; Galambos et al., 2015; Mann, DeYoung, & Krueger, 2021; Pfund & Lewis, 2020), a
more comprehensive evaluation of aging-related changes across well-being components is
warranted. One valuable pathway to build from the current work would be to evaluate how these
age trajectories vary based on other aspects of well-being, and whether these changes co-occur
within individuals.
Conclusion
LIFSPAN TRAJECTORIES OF AFFECT
The present research used a coordinated data analysis spanning the adolescent and adult
portions of the human lifespan to evaluate the generalizability of lifelong trajectories of negative
and positive affect across diverse methods and samples. Our study provides strong evidence
across 14 longitudinal studies to clarify the mixed findings of previous research, finding that
positive affect remains relatively stable in young adulthood before beginning to decline in midlife
whereas negative affect declines throughout most of adulthood reaching its nadir in older
adulthood before stabilizing. Affect balance, conceptualized long ago by scholars as central to
understanding well-being (Bradburn, 1969), may vary in important ways over the human
lifespan. These findings suggest that older adults may experience the affective benefit of lower
negative emotion but may experience declines in positive emotion.
