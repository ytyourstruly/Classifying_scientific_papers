Abstract
We examine how exposure to energy transition and climate policy vulnerability
influence popular support for more ambitious climate policy. Moreover, we
explore whether this relationship depends on a person's generalized and political
trust. Comparing data from surveys in Germany and Switzerland, our findings
reveal that perceived exposure to energy transition positively influences climate
policy support, while individual climate policy vulnerability decreases it. For
individuals with higher levels of trust, exposure helps enhance the positive effect
(subjective exposure) or dampen the negative effect (policy vulnerability). These
results underscore the importance of incorporating trust and subjective
perceptions into climate policy frameworks.

1. Introduction
Energy transition in Europe needs to proceed at an accelerated pace due to both the evolving
climate crisis and new geopolitical challenges. European countries are pressured to find policy
solutions to phase out fossil fuels and replace them with clean renewable energy. In strengthening
existing policy (e.g. speeding up permit procedures for renewable energy, increasing climate
investment, increasing carbon prices, ramping up the energy efficiency of buildings,
decarbonizing transportation etc.), policymakers need to implement effective solutions while
sustaining public support for more ambitious climate and energy policy. This paper investigates
how individual exposure, policy vulnerability and trust contribute to shaping public endorsement
for the expansion of such policies.
To conceptualize policy expansion, we examine attitudes toward an increase in (or introduction
of) national carbon taxes. Carbon taxes are a prominent policy proposal to steer people away
from socially and environmentally costly fossil fuels and incentivize both firms and individuals
to switch to greener energy sources (Schaffer 2021). Although such tax increases are an effective
tool to change behaviors, they are generally unpopular, and especially the distributional effects
of carbon taxes have been found to decrease popular acceptance drastically (Schaffer 2023,
Beiser-McGrath and Bernauer 2023).
We first argue that perceptions of exposure to the energy transition, as well as the expected
vulnerability to the impact of the proposed policy expansion shape support for an increase in
carbon taxes. In terms of exposure, past decades have brought about a considerable
transformation in the energy sector and have elevated the level of renewable energy generation.
Nations have developed different schemes to incentivize renewable energy generation (Bayer
and Urpelainen 2016; Schaffer and Bernauer 2014) and have considerably increased renewable
energy generation. The accompanying decentralization of energy supply with wind turbines and
solar energy plants has made the transition more visible to the public. However, their perceptions
of this exposure vary depending on where people live.
Regarding policy vulnerability to climate policy expansion, we argue that people’s support
hinges on their individual climate policy vulnerability, for example, varying according to their
reliance on fossil fuels. Overall, we suggest that perceptions of exposure to energy transition and
considerations about individual policy exposure (vulnerability) matter for attitudes toward more
ambitious climate policy.
In a second step we then connect the perceptions of previous exposure and policy vulnerability
that people may consider when evaluating carbon tax increases (as an example of a more
A1
ambitious policy), to their generalized and political trust levels. Previous studies found that
people with higher trust levels have a higher level of support for carbon taxes. Hence, those with
a higher trust in the political process believe that the new policies can bring about societal benefits
even if these policies personally disadvantage them (Umit & Schaffer 2020; Fairbrother 2019).
While this direct effect of trust on climate policy support is well documented in the literature, the
novelty of our approach is that we investigate how trust affects the relationship between
exposure, vulnerability, and the support for policy expansion. We propose that people with higher
levels of trust generally accept long-term governmental decisions (e.g., on energy transition) and
support their implementation, even if it jeopardizes their self-interest. Previous studies have
found that people exposed to visible climate change technology like wind turbines have a more
negative attitude towards climate change policy (Umit & Schaffer 2020). We find that
generalized trust weakens this connection, so for people with higher generalized trust, the
negative effect of exposure on support for ambitious climate policy vanishes.
Lastly, our comparative policy analysis scrutinizes how contextual factors affect the relationships
mentioned above. In our empirical section, we leverage nationally representative survey data
from Switzerland and Germany for our principal analysis and compare this to survey data from
Hungary, an eastern European EU country with a comparatively shorter history of climate policy
action.
To sum up, the research interest within this paper is threefold: first, we are interested in how
individual perceptions of exposure to energy transition and the vulnerability to a proposed policy
influence how people think about more ambitious climate policy expansion. We argue that
overall, the more people feel exposed and vulnerable to energy transition, the more negative they
are towards leveling up climate efforts. Second, we explore whether levels of generalized and
political trust can ameliorate the effect of exposure on support for policy expansion. Are
individuals with high trust more accommodating of governmental proposals to ratchet up policy
even when they are highly exposed or vulnerable to these policies? Third, we explore whether
people in countries that have been exposed to fewer energy transition policies differ in their
attitudes towards new policies. In light of the challenges ahead on the issue of climate change, it
is imperative that policymakers know more about the determinants of support for climate policy
expansion.
The results show that our two individual exposure measures to energy transition and policy
vulnerability have different implications for individual support for expansion of climate policy.
On the one hand, subjective exposure to (past) energy transition is positively related to a person’s
support for climate policy expansion. This effect, however, is mainly driven by people’s
A2
perceived exposure to solar energy. Moreover, both generalized and political trust significantly
increase the positive relationship between exposure and policy support. Whereas for low-trust
individuals higher perceived exposure leads to less support for climate policy expansion, high-
trust individuals with a high subjective exposure to renewable energy infrastructure show the
highest levels of support.
To assess how people might be affected by climate policy expansion, we look at factors such as
how often they use their cars, whether they own or rent their homes, and the age of the building
they live in. Interestingly, we observe a significant and negative association of these factors with
the support for climate policies, which indicates that individuals tend to evaluate proposals based
on their personal policy vulnerability. However, even in such situations of personal affectedness
and exposure, we discovered that higher levels of social and political trust could help lessen the
negative connection between being directly affected by policies and supporting more ambitious
climate measures.
The results have implications for our understanding of people’s acceptance of and opposition to
more ambitious climate policy. Our findings show that exposure to energy transition
infrastructure might meet opposition locally, but it is not generally associated with individuals
being less supportive of climate policy expansion. Conversely, controlling for respondents’
climate concerns, income, age, and ideology, especially distributional considerations (policy
vulnerability) are linked to less support for an increase in the CO tax.
2. State of the Art and Argument
2.1 Impact of Exposure and Vulnerability on the Support for Policy Expansion
To construct our argument on how exposure and vulnerability affect public policy support, we
introduce two concepts that we consider crucial for an individual’s support for policy expansion:
(1) individuals’ perceptions of exposure to energy transition and (2) individual vulnerability
towards more ambitious policy expansions.
Concerning the first concept, and in line with the literature on policy feedback, we argue that
existing policies shape present politics and policymaking (Béland 2010; Lowi 1964; Pierson
1993). Our interest pertains to climate-related energy transition policies designed to completely
transform fossil fuel dependent economies to rely on renewables instead. To reach this goal,
countries have taken different paths and implemented different policy mixes (Kern, Florian et al.
2019). Most industrialized countries have incentivized renewable energy production (e.g., via
feed-in tariffs or quota systems (Schaffer and Bernauer 2014) over the past 20-30 years. While
A3
research shows that these renewable energy efforts successfully reduced the respective national
carbon emissions (Le Quéré et al. 2019), locally, they have also led to greater visibility of
renewable energy infrastructure, such as wind turbines or solar panels.
We highlight two possible pathways to how exposure to renewable energy infrastructure can be
linked to people’s preferences for more ambitious policies First, individuals, households, and
broader communities have been able to actively participate in this transition by e.g., mounting
solar panels on their roofs or balconies. They have hence obtained potentially valuable
information about individual (positive and negative) implications from the large societal project
of energy transition. On the one hand, people might have experienced positive implications from
mounting solar panels themselves and understanding how their energy costs drop and how they
would not be affected less by a higher carbon tax. However, on the other hand, having renewable
energy infrastructure within one’s vicinity might be associated with negative visual or audio
impact (Hirsh and Sovacool 2013), place attachment (Devine-Wright 2009), adverse
environmental impacts (Ansolabehere and Konisky 2014) or lower property value (Cashmore et
al. 2019; Petrova 2013). Wind turbines are very visible in some rural regions that are better suited
to wind power generation . Overall, regional differences in renewable energy potential,
investment, and implementation have led to differences in individual exposure. Due to directly
observing the positive or negative impacts of these changes, the net effect on people in regions
with more visible infrastructure is not completely clear.
However, following up on the potentially negative personal implications from exposure
portrayed above, we contend that the ongoing politicization of both renewable energy
infrastructures as well as ambitious climate policies (such as carbon taxes) by right-wing populist
parties is an important explanation for why an individual's exposure to energy transition and their
overall stance on climate policy expansion are linked. Notably, right-wing populist parties
strategically position themselves against both energy transition infrastructure and broader, more
ambitious climate policies (Otteni and Weisskircher 2022, Schaffer et al. 2022), and thus
influence how people connect their exposures, policy vulnerabilities and attitudes to more general
climate policy progression.
1 For a recent comprehensive review of public opinion research on energy infrastructure, see Carley et al.
2020.
2 In the case of Germany, early movers even could attain considerable remuneration due to generous feed-
in tariffs. There, the generous remuneration for providers of renewable energy, however, have also led to
negative repercussions of energy transition as energy prices have increased (Bardt and Niehues 2016; Renn
and Marshall 2016).
3 In more urban or sunny regions, solar panels are a common sight for the people living there.
A4
Concerning the second concept, we argue that the implementation of more ambitious climate and
energy policies to transition away from fossil-fuel-based economies will inevitably have
distributional consequences (Colgan et al. 2020; Aklin and Mildenberger 2021; Gaikwad et al.
2022). The second aspect of policy exposure is consequently related to individual policy
vulnerability. In our context, policy vulnerability means climate change policies will be costlier for
some than others. We focus on the fact that carbon pricing makes fossil-fuel-based activities more
expensive than alternatives. This disproportionately affects individuals who drive more often and
those who, for example, depend on older fossil-fuel heating systems. As carbon-intensive activities
become more expensive with higher carbon taxes, we expect that people who are more exposed to
the policy consequences (that have a higher vulnerability) will be less supportive of policy
expansion. This definition of policy vulnerability centers on an individual’s general vulnerability
profile but does not account for an individual’s employment-related vulnerabilities (Gaikwad et al.
2022). Several studies find empirical evidence to the self-interested response to the higher costs
associated with carbon pricing (Carattini, Carvalho, and Fankhauser 2018; Douenne and Fabre
2020). Further, these considerations have been found to shape general climate and energy policy
preferences (P. Bergquist, Konisky, and Kotcher 2020; Drews and Van den Bergh 2016).
Overall, there are convincing arguments on how subjective exposure to renewable energy policy
and individual policy vulnerability can negatively impact an individual’s finances, place
attachment or standard of living. Thus, we argue that these types of exposures may lead to less
support for a more ambitious climate policy.
H1: People with higher exposure and vulnerability to energy transition are less supportive of
climate policy expansion.
2.2 How trust influences the link between exposure, policy vulnerability, and support for policy
expansion
Past contributions have found a robust link between measures of individual trust and individual
climate policy support (Davidovic and Harring 2020; Fairbrother, Johansson Sevä, and Kulin
2019; Hammar and Jagers 2006). Even more relevant for the focus of this paper, empirical studies
have shown that climate policy ambition increases with the level of trust (Douenne and Fabre
2020; Rafaty 2018). The literature usually refers to political and social (generalized) trust.
More specifically, in the literature on the acceptance of carbon taxes political trust has been
found to be important to explain policy support (M. Bergquist et al. 2022, Fairbrother 2022,
Cologna & Siegrist 2020, Umit and Schaffer 2020). One of the greatest hindrances to carbon tax
support is skepticism about whether the government will use the extra tax money to combat
climate change or use it to supplement general government spending (Hsu, Walters, and Purgas
A5
2008; Klok et al. 2006). If people believe political actors are genuinely doing their best for
society, they will support political decisions (such as the decarbonization of the economy and
more ambitious climate policy) and will be more willing to accept detrimental outcomes even if
these affect them personally. Hence, we argue that when people trust in the long-term direction
of governmental policy, they will support policy expansion more, even if they have been --or will
be—exposed or vulnerable to the consequences of the policy.
Similarly, a broader form of trust, generalized trust, has been positively linked to people’s carbon
tax preferences (Davidovic & Harring 2020), their climate behavior, and willingness to pay
(Cologna & Siegrist 2020; Smith & Mayer 2018). Thus, high generalized trust may help to solve
collective action problems such as climate change (Nannestad 2008, Smith & Mayer 2018). This
diffuse form of trust refers to expectations about other people’s preferences: it describes a view
that other people would not intentionally harm others if they could avoid it (Delhey, Newton, and
Welzel 2011). Smith & Mayer (2018:141) argue that trusting others to do the same is key for
people to change their behavior. With respect to climate policy support, Davidovic and Harring
point out: “Generalized trust is linked to policy support since people also need to trust their fellow
citizens and other actors to comply with the policies in order to accept their implementation”
(Davidovic and Harring 2020, 3). Analogously, we believe that generalized trust in other citizens
will ameliorate the potentially negative effects of exposure to energy transition as individuals
believe that others also contribute to the shared societal goal.
We argue that trust can ameliorate the negative relationship (H1) between exposure, policy
vulnerability, and policy expansion. Hence, people who are exposed and/or vulnerable to energy
transition BUT have a high generalized or political trust will feel less negative about a policy
expansion.
H2: Trust positively affects the relationship between Exposure, Policy Vulnerability, and
Policy Expansion.
3 Data and Design
3.1 Survey
Our analysis is based on data from a nationally representative survey in Germany, Switzerland,
and Hungary. In Germany, we conducted our survey just before the September 2021 elections;
the Swiss survey was fielded in the summer of 2022, one year after the electorate rejected a
proposal for a more ambitious CO law, and the Hungarian survey was fielded before the general
A6
elections in April 2022. Sonda Ipsos recruited an online representative sample of 3500 subjects
from Germany and 2500 each from Switzerland and Hungary.
We chose Germany and Switzerland for our principal analysis for several reasons. First, these
two countries have a long history of climate change and energy transition policies. The significant
funding for financing the Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz (EEG) from the year 2000 onwards
marks the beginning of the road toward “Energiewende”. Similarly, the 1999 Swiss CO law, the
subsequent introduction of the CO levy in 2008 and finally the 2017 Energy Strategy 2050
decision are the most important policy innovations to make Swiss energy production carbon
neutral. Hence, policymakers in Germany and Switzerland have addressed various aspects of
both climate and energy policies and have already implemented far-reaching policies. Secondly,
voters have been “exposed” to energy transition policies. However, in both countries, regional
differences in (past) exposure exist depending e.g. on regional opportunities for renewable energy
generation. Also, differences exist in how vulnerable or exposed people are to carbon pricing
policies.
Hungary is economically less developed than Germany and Switzerland and energy transition
only started when it acceded to the EU. Hungary has remained in the bottom third of the EU
countries with respect to energy transition, and decarbonization became the primary focus of its
energy strategy only in 2019 (Nemzeti Energiastrategia 2019). Recently, there have been
discussions regarding the introduction of a carbon tax, but this has not yet been implemented.
This selection of countries allows us to test for similarities and differences in exposure and how
they are linked to climate policy support. Hence after having tested our propositions on two
leaders of energy transition (Switzerland and Germany), we validate our findings by testing
whether the general results hold also for Hungary, where people have been comparatively less
exposed.
3.2. Operationalization
Dependent variable: Policy expansion
1 The samples are representative of age, education, and rural-urban classification in Switzerland and Germany.
In Hungary, the sample is representative of age and rural-urban classifications.
2 Hungary is a unitary parliamentary country, in which the right-wing Fidesz has been in the government
from 2010 in coalition with the Christian Democrats. The Fidesz government’s stance has been mixed
towards renewable energy sources. While it supported the installation of solar panels on private homes, it

To operationalize our concept of a policy expansion towards a more ambitious climate policy,
we used a question on a potential carbon tax increase. We asked respondents whether and to what
extent they would support a CO tax increase if this was necessary. Respondents could choose
on a scale from 1 (support) to 4 (do not support) or chose a “don’t know” option. Our dependent
variable is whether people would support the increase of CO tax or not (Germany, Switzerland).
For the statistical analysis we used a reversed scale: 4 means that the respondent would support
a carbon tax increase to make the results more intuitive. To better understand the regional
CO tax increase in the 16 German states. Support is especially low in the eastern part of the
country and is highest in the city states and the more populous states including Nordrhein-
Westfalen and Baden-Württemberg.
We used an equivalent measurement in Hungary, except people could express their support for
the introduction of a carbon tax on a 1 (strongly support) to 5 (strongly oppose) scale or could
also chose “don’t know”.
Independent variables: Exposure and Trust
The focal independent variables are exposure to renewable energy sources (subjective
exposure), and exposure to policy expansion (policy vulnerability) as well as trust (generalized
trust and political trust).
In order to operationalize individual exposure to energy transition and policy vulnerability, we
leveraged two different measures. First and most innovatively, we asked our respondents
different questions about energy transition in their local area. This is mostly based upon exposure
to visible energy infrastructure and thus is a measure of energy transition exposure. The
questions used pertain only to solar and wind power. However, as these are the renewable
technologies that have exhibited the largest increase in capacity (IEA) and are readily observable
and sometimes controversial (Carley et al. 2020), we are confident they effectively capture
subjective exposure. To approximate individual exposure to wind energy infrastructure, we first
asked respondents whether the statements ’there are one or more wind turbines in my local area
/ commune’ or ’I see one or more wind turbines every day’ applied to them or not. To account
for solar exposure, we presented three statements: ’There are solar panels in my community’, ’At
1 The original questions are provided in online Appendix C1.
2 We do not directly compare the two variables in this study, but use a binary variable (oppose/support)
for the ancillary comparative analysis. First, the introduction (Hungary) and a subsequent increase
(Germany, Switzerland) of a carbon tax make people evaluate different concepts in our view. Second, in
Hungary we have a middle category (do not support, do not oppose). In Hungary we create the binary
variable by using the answers support and strongly support as the positive variable while oppose or strongly
oppose as a negative variable. As a robustness check we use middle categories and do not knows in the

different statements proxy the different levels of exposure from merely seeing solar panels to
owning them and participating in the process of energy transition.
expected, subjective exposure to wind energy is much lower in Switzerland than in Germany.
There are only a handful of wind farms and some are in remote mountainous terrain (Umit and
Schaffer 2022). Also, wind energy production per capita is around 17 kwh compared to 1619
kwh in Germany (Schweizerische Energiestiftung 2021). With respect to solar energy, subjective
exposure is more equal, although there is still a marked difference, Germany has higher per capita
production (614 kwh) compared to Switzerland (297 kwh).
Second, we accounted for respondents’ policy vulnerability by approximating their individual
policy vulnerability to more ambitious climate policy. To this end, we constructed an index and
measured how much respondents would be exposed to the concrete policy expansion at hand: an
increase of the CO tax. In the survey, we asked respondents how frequently they used their cars
(1-5), whether they owned their house/flat or are tenants (0,1) and finally, whether they lived in
an old house (‘Altbau’) or a new one (‘Neubau’) (1,0). The minimum value of this policy
vulnerability index was 0 (for someone who is a homeowner, lives in a new house and does not
use their car) while the maximum was 8 (for someone who rents their apartment/house, lives in
an old house and uses their car daily).
variable.
2 Recently, the importance of the distributional divide between home owners and tenants in progressing
energy transition has generated some scholarly interest (Schaffer 2023; Jansma et al. 2022; Voeten 2023).
Home owners can much easier participate in the energy transition and make their property fit for the energy
transition (buying solar panels, changing their heating system, electrifying their homes) to avert rising
prices due to carbon taxes, while tenants often have to cope with higher energy prices without being able
to do much against this. Their landlords would have to do it, but as energy costs are mostly borne by the
tenants themselves they have little incentive to do so.

We measured individual trust using two different metrics: generalized trust and political trust.
While political trust has robustly been found to influence individual climate policy attitudes
(Davidovic and Harring 2020; Fairbrother 2019; Fairbrother, Johansson Sevä, and Kulin 2019;
Hammar and Jagers 2006; Umit and Schaffer 2020), generalized trust has been a less prominent
determinant of people’s climate policy preferences (M.Bergquist et al. 2022; Cologna & Siegrist
2020), but has been found a significant predictor of people’s carbon tax preferences by Davidovic
& Harring (2020). As both political and social (generalized) trust are related, we tested both in
different models (Uslaner 2018). Generalized trust is measured by a well-established question
asking people to evaluate on a scale from 1 to 5 whether they believe that you cannot be too
careful (1: Man kann nicht vorsichtig genug sein) or most people can be trusted (5: Man kann
den meisten Menschen trauen). This measure has been found to be a reliable and valid way to
measure general(ized) trust (Delhey, Newton, and Welzel 2011).
Political trust was operationalized using two different items from our survey: We constructed
an index of political trust by averaging how much respondents indicated they trusted the
government and parliament. First, we asked people about their trust in several different
institutions on a 1-10 scale where 0 corresponded to “do not trust at all” and 10 to total trust (the
government, the media, the EU, parliament). Then we averaged their trust level towards the two
domestic institutions: the government and parliament. We did this to account for a possible
aversion to the current government by the supporters of the opposition. All these items have been
used and applied widely in previous empirical research (e.g. Kulin and Johansson Sevä 2021).
1 To account for the possibility that trust and political trust could be highly correlated, and thus the two
specifications measue the same thing, we also ran the general trust models controlling for the political

Control variables
Our control variables were the self-placement of people on the left-right ideological scale
(Ideology where 1 means Left and 10 means Right); concern about climate change (from 1 “not
worried” to 4 “very worried”); interest in politics (from 1 “not interested” to 4 “very interested”),
age group (below 25, 25-50, 50-75, above 75), gender (1 men, 2 women), and income (below 1Q
of the income distribution, between 1Q and median, between median and 3Q, above 3Q). We
expected that people who were more left-wing, more concerned about climate change, and
younger would be more supportive of energy transition in general and of ambitious climate
change policy more specifically (c.f. M. Bergquist et al. 2022).
Modeling strategy
First, we use a mixed-effect linear model to account for the hierarchical nature of our data
generating process, which allows for both fixed and random effects across the regions within the
countries to be taken into account. Second, we model binary policy support (as a yes or no) with
logit models within the individual countries to show how the results vary below the hierarchical
structure and how the respondents behave in each of the countries.
4 Results
In our theory section we hypothesized that people who felt exposed to energy transition policies
(both via past policies, or who are vulnerable to current policies) might support a possible
increase of the CO tax less than others all else equal. Moreover, we argued that the level of trust
people had in society and in politics could reduce the negative effects of exposure.
trust. We find that the two types of trusts have independent association with the support for carbon tax.
1 We do this first, to account for the unobserved heterogeneity between the cases. For this purpose, the
models contain country-region dummies. The mixed-effect model combines the fixed-effects and mixed-
effects models in a hierarchical way. With the fixed effects we control for the unmeasured characteristics
within each individual region. However, we also believe that the provinces are related to each other and
the concern for environmental issues became such a global phenomenon that we cannot treat the cases as
isolated, and thus we want to account for the possibility that the people in each province are exposed to
similar news and trends. Specifically, we believe that people with different levels of trust in the different
regions might relate to government policies similarly. We allow for this possibility with the random effects.

(M1 and M5) and how generalized and political trust impact this relationship (M2-4; M6-8). In
the main analysis, we only use the German and the Swiss data (see section on
operationalization).
We only partially confirm our hypotheses. Model 1 shows that contrary to our expectations, if a
respondent’s self-reported exposure to renewable energy infrastructure changes from no

variable (support, do not support). Furthermore, we show that the results hold in Hungary as well.

exposure (0) to high exposure to renewable energy sources in the neighborhood and at home (1)
(all else equal), then we predict an 8% increase in the respondent’s support for a carbon tax
increase. Although the effect size is not large, it is statistically significant by conventional
standards. To account for the potentially different effects in the exposure of wind turbines
compared to solar panels, we split the subjective exposure index and replaced it with separate
wind and solar indices in Model 2. People might consider solar panels less intrusive than wind
turbines which alter the view of the landscape (Umit and Schaffer 2022). We find that while
exposure to solar panels is associated with a 6% increase in support for the increase in carbon
tax, there is no correlation between exposure to wind turbines and support for carbon tax
1,2
increases.
However, in line with our hypothesis 1, we find that the potential individual policy vulnerability
is associated with greater opposition to climate policy expansion. Model 1 shows that a unit
increase in policy vulnerability, defined as high carbon usage for heating or travel, decreases
support for carbon tax increases by 11%. In line with previous literature (Cologna & Siegrist
2020; Davidovic & Harring 2020; Fairbrother 2022), our results show that both generalized trust
and political trust positively affect the support for the increase of carbon tax. As Model 1 in
increase in support for policy expansion.
In Models 3 and 7 we then explore how a person’s generalized (M3) and political (M7) trust
interact with his or her subjective exposure to renewable energy sources. To better interpret our
respondent has very little general trust in other people (a score of 1 on a 5-point scale), higher
levels of subjective exposure (on the x axis) make them less supportive of future climate policy
expansion (support of carbon tax increase on the y-axis). We predict, that for a person who trusts
others the least, an increase in renewable energy exposure from the minimum to the maximum
(being exposed in the city, in the neighborhood and at home) would decrease their support for
carbon tax from 1.8 to a 1.5 (a 7.5% change). This negative effect – that we had initially proposed
1 We also ran the regressions when we only included the exposure to solar panels and its interactions with
trusts. We find that indeed exposure to solar panels drives our results. We report these results in Appendix

renumerations in Switzerland. Our results do not change substantively.

in our H1 – however, vanishes and turns positive the more trusting the person is. We predict that
a person who trusts most people (5) would increase their support for a carbon tax increase from
2.5 to 3 (a 12.5% change) if exposed to past energy transition (1) compared to no exposure at all
stark. Also here, political trust clearly has a mitigating impact on how exposure affects climate
policy support.
Model 4 and 8 show how generalized and political trust can also affect the (negative) correlation
we find from an individual’s policy vulnerability to their support for policy expansion. In the
negative effect of the policy vulnerability variable. We predict that the least trusting people would
drop their support from 2.375 to 1.5 (a 22% change) when they are highly exposed to a policy
expansion (i.e. when they use their cars daily, rent or live in an old house etc.). However, for
individuals that exhibit high levels of trust, the negative effect of a larger exposure is very small
2.75 to 2.4 (a 9% change) Again, the results are similar in the case of political trust, albeit smaller.
While our control variables describing respondents’ political interest, climate concern, political
ideology, and age all are highly significant and bear the expected sign, we find that neither gender
nor income (after accounting for policy vulnerability) influence support.

4.1 Comparative analysis: Hungary
To (externally) validate our results of the effect of energy transition exposure on support for
ambitious climate policy, we compare our results from Switzerland and Germany to Hungary.
While the former countries embraced energy transition politically for over 20 years, Hungary has
just started on its path to carbon neutrality. Hungary has an energy strategy in place for 2030, but
this mostly consists of aspirational goals. The right-wing Fidesz government is against the
introduction of a carbon tax, although opposition parties have supported the idea of carbon
pricing. Hence, in the wake of the 2022 election (our survey was in the field two weeks before
the April elections) we could not ask our Hungarian respondents about a carbon tax increase, but
asked their opinion on a possible introduction of such tax. To make the results comparable across
countries, we transformed the answers to a binary variable showing whether a respondent
supports (1) or opposes (0) the increase (introduction of the) carbon tax (hence excluding the
A15
and political (Model 2, 4, 6) trust in Germany, Switzerland and Hungary. We indeed see that
none of our exposure variables influence people’s attitudes towards the introduction of the carbon
tax in Hungary where the population is (yet) the least exposed to renewables. Thus, while the
German and Swiss results are very similar in direction and significance, the results in Hungary
do not show a similar pattern. With respect to our trust measures, we can see that in Hungary too,
generalized trust is a robust predictor of climate policy expansion. Trust in political institutions,
however, is not significantly correlated with a more supportive attitude. This again points to the
importance of generalized trust as a predictor of collective good provision (Nannestad 2008).
Our control variables have a similar correlation to the outcome as in Germany and in Switzerland,
with two differences, in Hungary women and richer people have a higher support rate of the
introduction of a carbon tax than men and poor people. All the individual country models with
interactions are reported in the supplementary materials.

5. Conclusion
In this paper, we explored whether there was a link between people’s subjective exposure to
energy transition, their policy vulnerability, and their support for more ambitious climate change
policy. Moreover, we asked whether this relationship was conditional on a person’s generalized,
and political trust.
Our paper contributes to the rapidly expanding literature on individual attitudes toward climate
policy in at least three important ways. The first contribution lies in explicitly considering policy
expansion, i.e. our main outcome variable asks for people’s opinion on climate policy expansion.
In order to implement more stringent climate and energy policy towards the societal goal of
energy transition, we need to know more about people’s support for increasingly ambitious and
effective climate policy. Second, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly
consider measures of subjective exposure to energy transition and their impact on political
A17
attitudes. Our argument is that we need to go beyond the standard demographic variables and
consider how existing infrastructural changes to people’s communities and local areas may have
affected their support for more ambitious climate policy. Third, adding to a large literature that
has consistently pointed to the importance of trust for individual (climate policy) attitudes
(Davidovic and Harring 2020; Delhey, Newton, and Welzel 2011; Fairbrother 2019; Fairbrother,
Johansson Sevä, and Kulin 2019; Hammar and Jagers 2006; Umit and Schaffer 2020), we
develop arguments how individual trust conditions the (proposed negative) relationship between
exposure and support for climate policy expansion.
From our main analysis, we find that subjective exposure to energy transition does indeed matter
for people’s climate policy preferences. Both measures – subjective exposure to renewable
energy infrastructure and individual vulnerability with respect to more ambitious climate
policies - have a clear impact on people’s attitudes towards climate policy expansion. The good
news from our results is that those who are subjectively exposed to past energy transition are
actually on average more supportive of climate policy expansion. This is especially the case for
individuals that trust others and have trust in their political systems. Most importantly, we find
evidence that trust influences the relationship between exposure and policy support. Especially
high generalized trust (but also political trust) is associated with a more positive (less negative)
influence on climate policy support levels for exposed individuals. We externally validate our
results obtained from our two main country cases (Germany and Switzerland), by considering
the influence of exposure and vulnerability on climate policy expansion and the conditioning
effect of trust in a third country (Hungary) that is comparatively less advanced on their path
towards energy transition. We find corroborating evidence to the extent that in Hungary, where
people have not yet been as exposed, our exposure variables are not linked to policy support only
generalized trust is associated with the increased support for the tax. The only interaction we find
is between political trust and subjective exposure. This may be because of the solar panel program
of the Hungarian government (joint with the EU).
Overall, we can thus first conclude that although renewable energy expansion may face local
opposition, these concerns do not necessarily influence people’s general climate policy support.
However, based on our empirical evidence, second, we can also corroborate theoretical accounts
centering around the importance of distributional effects for climate policy support (Aklin and
Mildenberger 2020; Colgan, Green, and Hale 2021). Hence, individual exposure and
vulnerability toward climate policy expansion negatively affect policy support. Third, higher
generalized and political trust can help to improve the positive and lessen the negative effects of
subjective exposure and policy vulnerability on support for policy expansion.
