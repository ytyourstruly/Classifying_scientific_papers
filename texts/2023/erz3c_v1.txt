Abstract
Substance addictions are related to poorer interoceptive awareness (IA), which refers to the
conscious perception of internal bodily sensations. However, it is unclear whether poorer IA is
related to smartphone addiction (SA), a problem of growing societal concern due to its adverse
effects on mental health and sociability. By means of two studies conducted in Portugal, the
present investigation examined if lower IA correlates cross-sectionally and longitudinally with
greater SA, and if SA is reduced by relaxation exercises based on attention to interoceptive
sensations. In Study 1, 376 participants completed the Smartphone Addiction Scale – Short
Version (SAS-SV) and the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA).
In Study 2, 92 women completed these measures before and after being randomly allocated to
one of three conditions over four weeks: practice of autogenic training, practice of progressive
muscle relaxation, passive control condition without practice of relaxation exercises. In both
studies, lower IA correlated cross-sectionally with greater SA. In Study 2, increase in IA
correlated with decrease in SA across time. Both relaxation techniques led to a reduction in SA,
but only significantly so among the autogenic training group. Both relaxation techniques led to
an increase in IA greater than the one observed in the control condition, but not significantly so.
Reduction in SA among those who practiced a relaxation exercise (autogenic training or
progressive muscle relaxation) was not mediated by increase in IA. Poorer IA might be a
vulnerability factor not only for substance addictions, but also for SA. Autogenic training might
reduce SA, but mechanisms other than IA enhancement might play a role in this effect.

Overview
Problematic smartphone use or smartphone addiction (SA) is a problem of growing
societal concern that refers to the compulsive use of smartphones in way that interferes with
many aspects of life, including work productivity, responsibilities, social interactions, and sleep.
An extensive number of studies confirm associations of SA with psychopathology (Wachs &
Weinstein, 2021), loneliness (Ge et al., 2023; Hu & Chiang, 2022; Wachs & Weinstein, 2021),
and sexual difficulties (Fuzeiro et al., 2022). The causal relationship between SA and
psychopathology is likely bidirectional, and experimental studies indicate that frequent use of
smartphone to access social media may lead to stress, depression, loneliness, and life
dissatisfaction (Hunt et al., 2018; Kross et al., 2013; Lambert et al., 2022; Tromholt, 2016; Turel
et al., 2018). Moreover, smartphone use disturbs the enjoyment of social interactions with
family, friends, and partners (Dwyler et al., 2018; Hipp & Carlson, 2021; Robertson and David,
2016), and interferes adversely with social and emotional interactions between parents and
children, including infants (Kushlev & Dunn, 2019; Myruski et al., 2018). All this raises serious
concerns about the effects of SA on mental health, sociability, and social development. As such,
it is highly pertinent to understand factors contributing to SA in order to prevent and treat
smartphone misuse.
Substance addictions and SA might share common underlying causes. One factor
associated with substance addictions is disturbed interoceptive awareness (IA), which refers to
the conscious perception of internal bodily states (Craig, 2002). Although some strong
interoceptive responses can be triggered by drugs and drug-related cues (Paulus & Stewart, 2014;
Verdejo-Garcia et al., 2012), persons with drug addictions seem to have poorer IA on a general
basis. This view is supported by various studies showing that IA tends to be lower among people
with addiction to alcohol (Ates Çöl, et al., 2016; Meriç & Sönmez, 2022; Sübay & Sönmez,
2021), nicotine (Hinna & Aspell, 2019), cannabis/cannabinoids (Sübay & Sönmez, 2021),
heroin/opioids (Sönmez et al., 2017; Stewart et al., 2020; Sübay & Sönmez, 2021), and
stimulants (Stewart et al., 2020). Moreover, there is some evidence that interventions based on
focusing and amplifying attention to interoceptive sensations are helpful in reducing drug
craving, such as body-oriented mindfulness-based therapies (Price et al., 2019a, 2019b),
autogenic training (Chaney & Roszell, 1983; Roszell & Chaney, 1982), and progressive muscle
relaxation (Limsanon & Kalayasiri, 2015), which raises the possibility that enhancement of IA is
responsible for the efficacy of these types of therapy in treating drug addictions (Price et al.,
2019a, 2019b; Smith et al., 1984).
The possibility of SA and IA being inversely related is strengthened by a study showing
that SA was associated with lower gray matter volume in the insula, an area of the brain
associated with interoceptive awareness (Horvath et al., 2020). Yet, there is lack of studies
examining associations of SA with measures of IA, and whether SA is diminished by
interventions requiring attention focused on interoceptive sensations with preliminary evidence
suggesting that persons with internet addiction (which overlaps conceptually with SA) can
benefit from mindfulness training (Quinones & Griffiths, 2019), autogenic training (Shin & Kim,
2020), and progressive muscle relaxation (Quinones & Griffiths, 2019). To fill this gap in
knowledge, two studies described below were conducted. Study 1 confirmed the cross-sectional
association between IA and SA. Study 2 replicated the cross-sectional association between IA
and SA, and showed that increase in IA after four weeks correlated with decrease in SA after that
same period. Furthermore, Study 2 demonstrated that relaxation by means of attention to
interoceptive sensations (mainly autogenic training) reduces SA, but this was not mediated by an
increase in IA.
Study 1
Introduction
As discussed above, poorer IA might be related to greater SA. Yet, this putative
association might be due to confounds that need to be addressed. If poorer IA creates
vulnerability to substance addictions and those with SA also tend to be misuse psychoactive
substances, then an observed inverse association between IA and SA might be spurious, if it is
entirely explained by substance use. In fact, alcohol and tobacco misuse appear to be associated
with both SA (Kim et al., 2019; Wacks & Weinstein, 2021) and lower IA (Ates Çöl, et al., 2016;
Hinna & Aspell, 2019; Meriç & Sönmez, 2022; Sübay & Sönmez, 2021). As such, Study 1 tests
if IA correlates inversely with SA, and if this hypothesized correlation is explained by alcohol
and tobacco consumption.
Method
Participants and procedure
The sample consisted of 376 participants (318 women, 58 men) in a laboratory study
occurring between 2018 and 2021 in Lisbon, Portugal, and advertised as a study on sexuality,
personality, and online behavior; its protocol comprised a resting electrocardiogram recording
followed by the completion of a battery of instruments including measures of IA, SA, and
alcohol and tobacco use, in addition to measures on sexual function, mood, sleep quality, and
personality, which are not the focus of the present work. The participants were recruited through
the local university participant pool and received course credits or a shopping voucher for their
subsample composed by those who were sexually active with the opposite sex in the preceding
month were published elsewhere (Fuzeiro et al., 2022). The study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the local university and followed the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All
participants gave written informed consent.

Measures
Smartphone addiction was assessed with a Portuguese version (Água et al., 2017) of the
Smartphone Addiction Scale – Short Version (SAS-SV; Kwon et al., 2013). The SAS-SV is
composed by ten items rated on a scale from 1 (total disagreement) to 6 (total agreement). The
total score varies between 10 and 60. Cronbach’s alpha is the present study was .84.
Interoceptive awareness was assessed with a Portuguese version (Berenguer et al., 2019;
Florindo et al., 2019) of the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA;
Mehling et al., 2012). The MAIA is composed by 32 items rated on a scale from 0 (Never) to 5
(Always). Total scores are derived from the average of the item scores and vary between 0 and 5.
Cronbach’s alpha in the present study was .87.
Alcohol consumption was measured on a 5-point scale with the following options: 1) I do
not drink alcohol, 2) Less than 3 weekly drinks, 3) Between 3 and 10 weekly drinks, 4) Between
11 and 21 weekly drinks, 5) More than 21 weekly drinks.
Tobacco consumption was measured on a 3-point scale with the following options: 1) I do
not smoke, 2) Less than 10 cigarettes a day, 3) More than 10 cigarettes a day.
Statistical analyses
Pearson’s correlations were used to test associations between the variables of interest.
A parallel multiple mediation model with 5.000 bootstrap samples, available in the SPSS macro
PROCESS (Hayes, 2022), was used to test if the association between IA (independent variable)
and SA (dependent variable) is mediated by consumption of alcohol and tobacco (sex and age
were treated as covariates). Unstandardized coefficients and standard errors are reported;
significant indirect effects are determined by 95% confidence intervals that do not include zero.
Results
SA and IA occurred in women (r = -.16, p = .005) and men (r = -.09, p = .489), although not
significantly in the latter. In partial correlations controlling for frequency of consumption of
alcohol and tobacco, the correlation between SA and IA remained significant (r = -.15, p = .003).

Discussion
It was confirmed that IA is associated with SA. As indicated by the mediation model, this
association was not due to alcohol and tobacco consumption frequency; indeed, IA was unrelated
to alcohol and tobacco consumption (see Tables 2 and 3), which might be due to the low
proportion of participants consuming more than 21 drinks a week or smoking more than 10
Study 2
Introduction
As noted above, the notion that poorer IA predisposes to substance addiction is
corroborated by interventional studies revealing that drug craving can be diminished by exercises
that amplify the attentional focus on interoceptive sensations, as it happens during body-oriented
mindfulness training, autogenic training, and progressive muscle relaxation (Chaney & Roszell,
1983; Limsanon & Kalayasiri, 201; Price et al., 2019a, 2019b; Roszell & Chaney, 1982).
Preliminary evidence also suggests that these three types of intervention are beneficial to reduce
internet addiction (Quinones & Griffiths, 2019; Shin & Kim, 2020), a construct that overlaps
with smartphone addiction. Autogenic training and progressive muscle relaxation are two
popular relaxation techniques; in the case of autogenic training, the attention is mainly focused
on involuntary bodily responses driven by the autonomic nervous system (heartbeat, body
warmth, body heaviness), whereas in progressive muscle relaxation, the attention is focused on
the feelings of voluntary muscle tension and subsequent muscle relaxation.
Thus, Study 2 tests whether SA diminishes after four weeks of autogenic training or
progressive muscle relaxation in comparison with a passive control condition with no assigned
relaxation exercises.
Method
Participants and procedure
Initially, 141 women were recruited for an investigation on effects of relaxation
techniques on sexual functioning, mood, sleep quality, and body awareness. However, only 92
characteristics are displayed in Tables 4 and 5). The participants were recruited between 2019
and 2023 in Lisbon, Portugal, through the local university participant pool and by advertisement;
they all received shopping vouchers for their participation. Inclusion criteria were being over 18
years old, sexually active, and involved in a heterosexual relationship, as the study intended to
explore the effects of relaxation on sexual functioning and potential underlying mechanisms.
Baseline data collected during a first visit to the laboratory session comprised the same protocol
described in Study 1. In this first session, participants were randomly allocated to one of three
conditions: 1) practice of autogenic training, 2) practice of progressive muscle relaxation, 3) a
passive control condition without relaxation exercises and no task assigned. Also in the first
session, those allocated to the autogenic training or progressive muscle relaxation conditions
were taught how to practice the exercises (see below) and instructed to practice them at least
twice weekly during four weeks. They were additionally instructed to complete a short online
questionnaire after each relaxation exercise with which the experience was described; this post-
task questionnaire was comprised by five questions concerning perception of body, surrounding
space, time, and subjective time speed, during the exercise (Campos et al., 2021; Costa et al.,
2016; Pfeifer et al., 2016) in addition to an open-ended format question regarding any
observation that the participant would like to make. This questionnaire was expected to allow a
better integration of the relaxation experience and favor the effectiveness of the relaxation
exercise (Stetter & Kupper, 2002).
The autogenic training and progressive muscle relaxation exercises consisted of listening
to one of several audiovisual recordings available on YouTube with duration ranging between 11
and 20 minutes. The links were provided by the research team and participants were told to
choose the one they preferred for each exercise. The employed versions of autogenic training
induced awareness of heaviness and warmth of arms and legs, heartbeat, breathing, and coolness
of the forehead. Participants were told to listen to the recordings with closed eyes, while sitting
or lying, during a quiet moment in which they would not be disturbed. Both male and female
voices were provided in the audiovisual recordings.
In order to teach participants how to practice the relaxation exercises during the initial
session, they were asked to practice autogenic training or progressive muscle relaxation, guided
by the voice of one of the available recordings, while they sat alone in a room in the laboratory.
Before the exercise, they were asked if they prefer a recording with a male or female voice; a
general preference for opposite-sex (male) voice was noted. After the exercise, they were asked
if it was comfortable and feasible to practice it at least twice weekly for four weeks. The study
received approval from the local Ethics committee and complied with the Declaration of
Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent.

Measures
The measures were the same as in Study 1.
Statistical analyses
The associations between the variables of interest were examined with Pearson’s
correlations.
The possibility of alcohol and tobacco consumption mediating the association between
IA and SA at baseline and after four weeks was tested with parallel multiple mediation models
similar to those used in Study 1, with age entering in the models as covariate.
To test if relaxation exercises diminish SA, a 2x3 repeated measures ANOVA was
conducted to examine differences between baseline SA and post-intervention SA with
intervention type as between-subjects factor (autogenic training, progressive muscle relaxation or
passive control condition) and baseline SA as covariate in order to control for baseline
differences in SA between groups.

The temporal stability of both IA and SA was strong, as demonstrated by the strong correlations

meaning that increase in IA was associated with decrease in SA during the intervention period.

Discussion
Study 2 replicated the finding that greater SA correlates with lower IA, and that this is
not due to alcohol and tobacco consumption. In fact, in Study 2, no participant reported heavy
drinking (more than 21 weekly drinks) and very few were heavy smokers (more than 10
in IA correlated with decrease in SA across time, suggesting that poorer IA might predispose to
greater SA in a relatively short time frame.
Further, it was found that relaxation exercises based on attention to interoceptive
sensations decreased SA (especially autogenic training) in comparison to a passive control
condition, but this was not explained by increase in IA. In fact, both relaxation techniques
enhanced IA more than the control condition, but this difference was not significant, as those in
the control condition also showed some gains in IA. Hence, it could not be concluded that the
benefits of relaxation techniques are due to IA enhancement.
General discussion
The present investigation confirmed that poorer IA is associated with greater SA and that
greater increase in IA is associated with greater decrease in SA over time. These findings
corroborate the view that impaired IA is a risk factor not only for substance addictions, but also
for SA. Effect sizes were weak to moderate; poorer IA is one among many factors underlying
substance addictions (Paulus & Stewart, 2014), and there is no reason to think that that would be
different in SA.
It was proposed that poorer IA might create vulnerability to substance addictions due to
insufficient conscious awareness of bodily signals and related emotions conveying information
about the negative consequences of drug use (Verdejo-Garcia et al., 2012). Moreover, because
focus on interoceptive sensations can often be used to regulate emotional states (Melhling et al.,
2012), individuals with more impaired IA might put greater reliance on external regulators of
emotional states, such as drugs. It is possible that the inverse association between IA and SA is at
least partly due to similar processes. Individuals with poorer IA might be less likely to feel
bodily signals conveying information about the negative consequences of prolonged smartphone
use (e.g., effects on mood, interference in important activities, lack of sleep). Also, because
poorer IA may reflect lesser ability to regulate emotional states by being attentive to
interoceptive sensations, individuals with lower IA may be more prone to use the smartphone as
a way of regulating negative mood, which is highly facilitated by smartphones probably being
the most accessible external regulator of emotional states. However, resorting to smartphones for
coping often appears to be a short-lived and ineffective strategy (Wolfers et al., 2023).
Of course, due to the correlational nature of the findings, it is not possible to exclude that
the inverse correlation between IA and SA is, at least in part, explained by SA diminishing IA.
This possibility to should be considered in future studies. When one is intensely absorbed by
smartphone activities, body awareness is likely reduced, but to what extent this could lead to
chronic lack of attention to interoceptive sensations is presently unclear.
It was hypothesized that relaxation exercises, with their attentional focus on interoceptive
sensations, reduce SA with the rationale that this is due to enhancement of IA. In fact, we
confirmed that, in comparison with the control condition, relaxation exercises can reduce SA
(especially autogenic training). However, increase in IA did not explain the reduction in SA
observed among those practicing relaxation exercises. Yet, the possibility that IA enhancement
has a role in the beneficial effects of relaxation on SA reduction should not be discarded and
future research might clarify this question.
Several processes have been proposed to explain the positive effects of relaxation
techniques on reduction of substance addiction symptoms, encompassing anxiety reduction,
increased self-control, and increased pleasure from interoceptive sensations duration relaxation
exercises, which could replace drug-related pleasure to some extent (Chaney & Roszell, 1983;
Klajner et al, 1984; Roszell & Chaney, 1982; Shin & Kim, 2020). Although plausibly all these
processes correlate with greater IA, they are to some extent independent of it. Future studies
might elaborate complex predictive models including various possible mechanisms explaining
reduction in addictive behaviors.
Although relaxation exercises led to significantly greater reductions in SA in comparison
to the control condition, these effects were small in magnitude. This indicates that relaxation
exercises are no panacea and are more likely to be beneficial, if integrated with other treatment
approaches as adjunctive treatments. Yet, both autogenic training and progressive muscle
relaxation are cost-effective approaches that are easy to teach and to practice, and the present
investigation supports their inclusion in the therapeutic options for problems related with
smartphone misuse.
Limitations of the study include a relatively small sample mostly or, in case of Study 2,
entirely, composed of women. Also, it would be important for future research to control for other
variables, such as food addiction which shares many similarities with substance addictions and is
related to internet addictions (Wacks & Weistein, 2021; Borges & Costa, 2022).
In conclusion, the results support the view that poorer IA is a risk factor for SA.
Furthermore, SA might be reduced by relaxation techniques requiring attentional focus on
interoceptive sensations (notably autogenic training).
