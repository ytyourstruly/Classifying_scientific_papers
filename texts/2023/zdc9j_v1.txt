Abstract
Intergroup friendship in schools is regarded as a powerful strategy for improving outgroup attitudes.
However, stochastic actor-oriented modeling (SAOM) studies have often revealed no association
between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes. We investigated whether SAOM studies
reported no effect of intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes, what was responsible for this
surprising finding, and whether exposure to outgroup peers was positively related to outgroup
attitudes. Our meta-analysis of SAOM studies confirms no association between intergroup friendship
and outgroup attitudes. Examining longitudinal social network data of 2,700 German students, we
found that a positive link between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes appeared only when
we did not control for social influence. Exposure to outgroup peers was, however, positively
associated with outgroup attitudes. These findings reframe intergroup contact theory by suggesting
that intergroup friendship is not essential for improving outgroup attitudes. Instead, social influence
and exposure to outgroup peers affect their outgroup attitudes.
Intergroup contact has become a prominent strategy to improve attitudes of individuals towards
different ethnic groups, particularly in schools (Boin et al., 2021; Pettigrew, 2008, 2011). Within
schools, students are given an opportunity to bond with peers from different backgrounds and build
the friendships which are considered to be the most powerful form of intergroup contact (Allport,
1954; Page-Gould et al., 2022; Pettigrew, 1998; Pettigrew et al., 2011). Intergroup friendship has
been given a great deal of attention as an ideal form of intergroup contact, and researchers have
started applying social network analysis, particularly stochastic actor-oriented modeling (SAOM), to
study intergroup relations, including intergroup friendship, in schools (Bracegirdle et al., 2022;
Zingora et al., 2019).
SAOM is a state-of-the-art method used for the analysis of longitudinal social network data, which
can address the dynamic development of interpersonal relationships and how these relationships
translate into a change in attitudes and behaviors (Snijders et al., 2010). SAOM enables testing for
the human tendencies that guide the development of friendships, such as preferences for forming
friendships with peers who share similarities, tendencies which are crucial for understanding the
effects of such friendships on students (Steglich et al., 2006). The influence of these tendencies could
obscure the effect of intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes.
Recent SAOM studies indicate that many did not identify any positive effect of intergroup friendship
on outgroup attitudes (e.g., Bracegirdle et al., 2022; Zingora et al., 2019). A closer inspection of why
these SAOM studies did not find intergroup friendships to have an improving effect on outgroup
attitudes could enhance our understanding of the impact of intergroup friendship and, more broadly,
the effects of exposure in schools to outgroup peers on students’ outgroup attitudes.
This study addresses three questions. Firstly, what effect of intergroup friendship on outgroup
attitudes did SAOM studies identify? This question was addressed by conducting a meta-analysis of
the published literature. Secondly, why did SAOM studies report no effect of intergroup friendship on
outgroup attitudes? To this end, we conducted a separate study to examine whether we could
replicate a non-significant effect of intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes and investigate why
this effect was not found. We focused on tendencies that are typically included in SAOM
investigations, specifically homophily tendencies and social influence. Lastly, does a different form of
intergroup contact – exposure to outgroup peers – have an effect on outgroup attitudes,
independent of intergroup friendship? The assumed profound effect of intergroup friendship on
outgroup attitudes is attributed to the positive, close, and frequent interactions that characterize
friendships (Paolini et al., 2007; Pettigrew, 1997; Turner et al., 2007). In schools, positive, close, and
frequent interactions can be found among classmates, such that intergroup friendship might not be
necessary to improve outgroup attitudes. To answer this third question, we tested whether exposure
to outgroup peers, specifically the number of outgroup peers, was positively related to outgroup
attitudes.
Intergroup friendship effect on outgroup attitudes and SAOM
Intergroup friendship, labeled as the most potent form of contact for reducing negative outgroup
attitudes, is a cornerstone of the intergroup contact theory (Pettigrew, 1997). The assumption is that
intergroup friendship is qualitatively different from positive intergroup contact (Davies et al., 2011;
Pettigrew, 1997). Gaining a friend from a group perceived as an outgroup to one’s own is expected to
facilitate the generalization of positive feelings from this friend to other members of that friend’s
group. However, despite these expectations, several SAOM studies have reported no significant
effect of gaining a friend from another group on outgroup attitudes (e.g., Bracegirdle et al., 2022;
Zingora et al., 2019). Reviewing one such study, researchers wondered why this link between
intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes had not been found and assumed that this was because
they had controlled for a combination of individual characteristics, such as ethnicity or religion
(McMillan et al., 2023). However, this explanation fails to account for the consistent lack of an effect
in other studies, where control variables vary but the effect of intergroup friendship on outgroup
attitudes was not found (e.g., Khuu et al., 2023; Zingora et al., 2019).
Friendships are dynamic, and changes in friendships are influenced by tendencies in relationship
formation that may produce a spurious association between intergroup friendship and outgroup
attitudes. The first set of tendencies that could be responsible for a false positive association
between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes is homophily tendencies (Steglich et al., 2010;
Veenstra et al., 2018). Following these tendencies, students often befriend peers with similar
characteristics, potentially including shared attitudes towards outgroup identity and ethnicity. As
such, students who already hold positive outgroup attitudes may select friends with similarly positive
outgroup attitudes. Outgroup peers could be expected to be positively biased towards their own
group (Tajfel et al., 1971), thus, they might be selected as friends by those adolescents who share
positive attitudes toward the members of this group. This selection could be identified in a study as
an association between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes, without acknowledging that
the students already held positive outgroup attitudes. In a similar vein, while it has been repeatedly
shown that students prefer to develop friendships with peers of similar ethnicity (Bracegirdle et al.,
2022; Stark, 2015; Zingora et al., 2019), this bias could be weaker among students who hold positive
outgroup attitudes and, again, result in a spurious association between intergroup friendship and
outgroup attitudes without the existence of a genuine causal relationship.
The second tendency that could obscure the effect of intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes is
social influence. Peers play a dominant role in the lives of adolescents and their influence crucially
shapes student attitudes, including outgroup attitudes (e.g., Van Zalk et al., 2013). As a result of
social influence, a student might develop more positive outgroup attitudes not because they have
gained an outgroup friend but because they have gained a friend with more positive outgroup
attitudes. Alternatively, the social influence of a friendship group could be responsible for
improvements in outgroup attitudes, rather than intergroup friendship or the social influence of
outgroup friends. Outgroup attitudes could be more positive in friendship groups that nurture
intergroup friendships as compared to ethnically homogenous friendship groups. Gaining an
outgroup friend in such a group could result in higher embeddedness within this group, exposing a
student to the social influence of friends with positive outgroup attitudes. In short, an identified
association between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes could actually reflect an
individual’s exposure to more positive outgroup attitudes held by a close friend or within a friendship
group. Understanding why several SAOM studies failed to find an effect of intergroup friendship on
outgroup attitudes could enhance our knowledge about the consequences of intergroup contact,
particularly intergroup friendship, on outgroup attitudes.
Exposure to outgroup peers
It is possible that exposure to outgroup peers in schools, as much or more than intergroup
friendship, could have beneficial effects on students’ outgroup attitudes. Intergroup friendship has
been assumed to have a profoundly positive effect on outgroup attitudes due to its characteristics,
which include repeated positive interactions and closeness between friends ( Davies et al., 2011;
Paolini et al., 2007; Pettigrew, 1997; Turner et al., 2007). Many of these characteristics might also
apply to interactions that occur between classmates. Previous research in five European countries
has shown that positive intergroup contact is more frequently experienced than negative intergroup
contact (Graf et al., 2014); this might also be expected to be the case in schools. Exposure to
outgroup peers could contribute to the development of more positive outgroup attitudes for those
with and without outgroup friends alike.
Experimental evidence on the effects of intergroup friendships on outgroup attitudes typically does
not distinguish between the effect of having a friend and having repeated positive interaction with
the same person (such as the Fast Friends procedure, Aron et al., 1997). Such experiments often
successfully induce close and intimate interactions, however, such manipulation also resembles close
and intimate positive contact, not necessarily between two friends. For instance, the manipulation
check of inducing intergroup friendship often relies on proxies, such as induced closeness between
interaction partners (Page-Gould et al., 2008), which might be typical not only for friendships but also
for positive interactions in general. Thus, experimental evidence found in support of a positive effect
of intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes (Kende et al., 2017; Lytle et al., 2023; Lytle & Levy,
2015; Page-Gould et al., 2008) could also apply in the context of close and repeated interactions with
outgroup members. In schools, the number of outgroup friends students have does not preclude
them from having positive interactions with other outgroup classmates. Moreover, friendships
change over time (e.g., Snijders & Baerveldt, 2003), which means that close and intimate knowledge
of one another is not limited to the current friendship relation. Thus, students could have positive,
close, and intimate interactions with each other even if they do not label each other the best friend.
This supports the argument that exposure to classmates in schools could suffice to improve outgroup
attitudes, given that such contact is typically positive.
The benefits seen to be associated with intergroup contact have been used to support arguments in
favor of policies such as the desegregation of schooling in the US. Research that can support the
prospect that exposure to outgroup classmates in schools can have a positive effect on outgroup
attitudes would likely be welcomed by practitioners and policymakers. Using intergroup friendship as
a strategy to improve outgroup attitudes brings many challenges. For one, it suggests practitioners
should influence students in their selection of friends – students typically choose to consider a
limited number of their peers as “friends”, and it is questionable whether we should intervene in this
decision. In addition, students, especially those who might most benefit from the relationship, might
be reluctant to befriend an outgroup person. Also, not everyone in a school might end up with an
outgroup friend, especially when members of a perceived outgroup form a minority in a school. All of
these challenges would be solved if exposure to outgroup classmates was found to have a positive
effect on outgroup attitudes.
Current research
In this research, conducted in two studies to test four hypotheses, we investigated the effect of
intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes, capitalizing on benefits of the SAOM approach, such as
its capacity to capture the impact of social influence.
In Study 1, we conducted a meta-analysis of the literature to determine whether SAOM studies in
particular reported no effect of intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes.
H1: The effect of intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes is undistinguishable from zero
in published SAOM studies.
In the second part of this research, we conducted a SAOM study. Our first goal was to replicate the
findings reported in the meta-analysis and examine the reasons why the analyzed SAOM studies
revealed no link between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes. In contrast to different
analytical approaches, SAOM enables researchers to investigate the impact of tendencies including
homophily and social influence.
H2: Intergroup friendship will have no effect on outgroup attitudes when we control for
homophily tendencies based on gender, ethnicity, and outgroup attitudes but will have an
effect when do not control for these homophily tendencies.
H3: Intergroup friendship will have no effect on outgroup attitudes when we control for
social influence but will have an effect when do not control for social influence.
Finally, we investigated whether a different form of intergroup contact – exposure to outgroup peers
– had an effect on outgroup attitudes.
H4: The higher the exposure to outgroup peers, the more positive outgroup attitudes
students will have.
Study 1
While research investigating SAOM studies indicates that there is no effect of intergroup friendship
on outgroup attitudes (Bracegirdle et al., 2022; Zingora et al., 2019), it remains possible that our
perception of the existence of a link between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes in SAOM
studies is biased. For instance, one study reported an effect of intergroup friendship on one outcome
but not the second (Van Zalk et al., 2013). To capture the average effect of intergroup friendship on
outgroup attitudes found in published SAOM studies, we conducted a meta-analysis.
Method
This meta-analysis was preregistered on OSF in accordance with the PRISMA-P checklist (Page et al.,
2021) and can be found here:
Inclusion Criteria. As stated above, we were interested in the effect of intergroup contact,
especially friendship, on outgroup attitudes. Our first inclusion criterion thus reflects an independent
variable that was critical to us. We were interested in relationships that could be broadly labeled as
“intergroup friendships”, so only studies that captured data relevant to participants having friends
from a different social group were included.
The second inclusion criterion reflected the required dependent variable. We were interested in any
type of prejudice or outgroup attitudes. We were also interested in studies investigating a general
attitude toward outgroups, such as tolerance, or an attitude toward a specific social group.
The third inclusion criterion reflected our interest in studies that applied SAOM. Thus, we included
only those studies that reported using SAOM.
The fourth and final inclusion criterion was language of publication: we included only studies
published in English.
Search strategy. Initially, we planned to scan only records in Scopus using the combination of
these key words: prejudice, bias, attitude, SAOM, RSiena, intergroup contact, intergroup friend,
outgroup contact, outgroup friend. However, this search generated only a small number of studies
that satisfied the inclusion criteria (see below). Thus, we extended our search and used software that
helps to find related articles: ResearchRabbit (Sharma et al., 2022). Using this strategy, we found and
reviewed 31 studies, from which we identified seven eligible studies, reporting a total of nine tests of
intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes.
Coded variables. We coded a range of variables that could be grouped into three categories:
1) study details, such as sample size or the name of the dataset; 2) effect sizes; 3) potential
moderating variables, such as inclusion of control variables like social influence and homophily.
Analytical approach
We analyzed estimates reported in SAOM studies which could be interpreted as log-odds (Ripley et
al., 2023). We applied a random effects model using the metafor package implemented in R
(Viechtbauer, 2010). We also included identifiers of each given study and the dataset used in the
analysis as random factors. This was done to account for both the fact that one study could report
multiple effects of interest within the same sample, as well as the fact that the same dataset could
be used in different studies.
Results
Overall, we did not find any effect of intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes in the eligible
SAOM studies (estimate = .11, SE = .07, p = .130). In fact, only one study reported a significant effect
of intergroup friendship on the outcome and even this study reported a non-significant effect of
intergroup friendship on the second outcome (Van Zalk et al., 2013). All records of the data analysis
outgroup attitudes using SAOM.
Note. RE Model = random effect model. The right column reports estimates and confidence intervals.
Effects found by Bracegirdle et al. (2022) represent estimates found separately for majority and
minority students. Effects found by Van Zalk et al. (2013) represent estimates related to two different
outcomes. In the analysis, this dependency was accounted for by using random effects.
Summary of Study 1
In the first part of this paper, we identified prior research that applied SAOM to explore the link
between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes. In nine longitudinal tests including about
10,000 individuals, we found no support for the effect of intergroup friendship on outgroup
attitudes. This contrasts with previous research that applied methods other than SAOM and suggests
that intergroup friendship improves outgroup attitudes (e.g., Davies et al., 2011). SAOM uniquely
enables researchers to study tendencies that could be responsible for a seemingly positive link
between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes. This could be an explanation for the different
conclusions arising from SAOM studies as compared to those using different analytical approaches.
The explanation for a missing link between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes was
investigated in Study 2.
Study 2
To explain why intergroup friendship is not found to be connected to outgroup attitudes in SAOM
studies, we focused on two sets of tendencies – homophily and social influence. As we explained
previously, SAOM can disentangle the effects of intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes from
the effects of tendencies such as homophily and social influence exerted by friends. To investigate
potential reasons for a missing link between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes in SAOM
studies, we tested H2 and H3 in Study 2.
This missing link between intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes in SAOM studies could be
understood as limiting the potential of intergroup contact in schools to challenge systems of social
inequality (McMillan et al., 2023). We are more optimistic and argue that intergroup contact is not
strictly limited to friendships, and regular exposure to outgroup peers in schools could have
beneficial impacts on outgroup attitudes, assuming that such intergroup contact is usually positive
(Graf et al., 2014). To this end, we also tested H4 in Study 2.
To test these three hypotheses, we studied the friendship networks of students in Germany. Previous
research showed that the effect of intergroup contact on attitudes could differ across encountered
ethnic groups (Zingora et al., 2020). For the sake of robustness, we separately investigated friendship
with and attitudes of students towards the two largest minority groups found in the dataset: Poles
and Turks. We also explored whether the attitudes of ethnic majority and minority students were
differently affected by having outgroup friends.
Method
This study was preregistered on OSF
Sample
We used three waves of data from the Friendship and Identity in Schools dataset (Leszczensky et al.,
2020). Data were collected from 2,700 adolescents (11 to 17 years old at the first wave, M = 12.6)
age
across 10 schools (29 grades) in Germany. This dataset is relatively large and appropriate for testing
our hypotheses. Previous research addressed the question of power in SAOM studies using a
simulation approach and indicated that our sample size is sufficient (Stadtfeld et al., 2020). This
dataset is publicly available upon request. To access data, one needs to apply at DeZIM Research
Measures
Friendship network. Students were given a list of their peers within the same school grade
from which they could select up to ten friends. The average size of the networks was 97.86 students,
Outgroup attitudes. We were interested in attitudes of students towards two ethnic
outgroups: Poles and Turks. Students were asked how much they like these groups on a scale from 1
(very much) to 5 (not at all); responses were recoded, and higher values represented more positive
attitudes. If students selected 6 (I do not know), their response was treated as missing.
Ethnicity. We used a measure of ethnicity prepared by the data collection team (Leszczensky
& Pink, 2015). Each student’s ethnicity was assigned based on their country of birth and the ethnicity
of their parents and grandparents. If both parents or grandparents were born outside of Germany,
maternal country took preference in deciding the ethnicity of a student. In this variable, students
whose ethnicity was rare within the sample were grouped together based on geographical similarity
of the country of origin. Crucially, students with Polish and Turkish background were sufficiently
numerous and their ethnic background was not merged with other ethnicities. For more information
about non-trivial cases, see Dollman et al. (2014). All ethnic groups are listed in Online
Supplementary Materials A.
Gender. Students were asked to identify their sex (1 = girl, 2 = boy).
Ethnic minority membership. We constructed two measures of ethnic minority membership
that reflected whether we were interested in the attitudes of students toward Turks or Poles. In the
model that focused on attitudes towards Turks, we treated ethnic minority membership of students
with Turkish background as missing. In the model that focused on attitudes towards Poles, we
treated ethnic minority membership of Poles as missing. These two variables were used for testing
the different effects of intergroup contact on the outgroup attitudes of majority and minority
students, as we wanted to avoid including results from these groups in our analysis of student
outgroup attitudes. This procedure ensured that the attitudes of Turks were not analyzed when we
studied attitudes towards Turks and attitudes of Poles were not analyzed when we studied attitudes
towards Poles.
Analysis
We used SAOM to analyze longitudinal three-wave data using an R package RSiena (Ripley et al.,
2023). In general, SAOM allows researchers to estimate effects responsible for any changes in
friendship networks and in attitudes or behaviors and such changes are often intertwined. For
instance, students can select friends with similar attitudes but they might also influence each other’s
attitudes after becoming friends. SAOM enables researchers to disentangle and account for such
processes.
The key characteristic of the SAOM is the focus on the individual perspective. SAOM simulates
changes in the network or attitudes from the perspective of an individual in a series of mini-steps. At
each mini-step, an individual has an opportunity to create, maintain, or dissolve a friendship or
change behavior (by 1 on a scale from 1 to 5 in this research). The decision making that is simulated
by the model is informed by the state of the friendship network, the characteristics of the individual,
and the effects determined by the researcher. Using a large number of repeated simulation, SAOM
estimates the effects that could be responsible for the changes in the network and attitudes.
SAOM enables researchers to estimate two functions that represent changes in a network or in
attitudes. The network function captures effects responsible for the changes in network. The attitude
function contains effects responsible for the changes in attitudes. Researchers can select from a
range of effects they find theoretically important. To ensure that the selected effects correctly
captured the changes in the networks of the sample population, we conducted a goodness of fit test
(see Online Supplementary Materials B). Technical description of all effects used in the analysis, see
Online Supplementary Materials C. P-values of estimates reported in this study were obtained using
a Wald-type test (Ripley et al., 2023).
We analyzed 29 school grades in one multigroup object. This procedure was selected because we
were interested in the group effect of the exposure to outgroup peers affecting the changes of
everyone in a school grade.
We evaluated two sets of five models: one created to capture attitudes toward Turks, and one
created to capture attitudes toward Poles. The purpose of Model 1 was to test whether a non-
significant association between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes could be replicated in
our data. In Model 1, we included all effects typically included in SAOM studies that tested the effect
of intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes, including homophily and social influence. The impact
of intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes was tested with the effect of the number of outgroup
friends on outgroup attitudes. To abstract the effects of intergroup friendship, we constructed six
dyadic variables that represented whether each pair of students contained a) a majority student or b)
a minority student and a) a majority student, b) a minority student, or c) an outgroup student. To
estimate the effects of these intergroup friendships, we had to estimate all potential combinations of
friendships between students from different groups. Thus, we additionally created two additional
variables that represented whether each pair of students contained an outgroup student (Turkish or
Polish, depending on the model) and a) an outgroup student (Turkish or Polish, depending on the
model) or b) any other student.
In Model 1, the effect of intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes was tested when a dyadic
covariate included an outgroup student and a majority or a minority student. We created two sets of
dyadic covariates, depending on whether we were interested in the effects of intergroup friendship
with Turkish classmates or with Polish classmates. “Outgroup students” were Turks in models
focused on attitudes towards Turks, and Poles in models focused on attitudes towards Poles. The
consideration of the effects of homophily involved three separate tendencies: to select friends of
similar gender, similar ethnicity, or similar outgroup attitudes. Social influence was reflected in a
tendency to change outgroup attitudes in the direction of an average attitude among friends. In
Model 1, we used a score type test to confirm that there was non-existent intergroup friendship
effect on outgroup attitudes if this effect was found to be non-significant (see Ripley et al., 2019).
To test H2, Model 2 included all effects as Model 1 except homophily. H2 would be confirmed if we
found no effect of intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes in Model 1 but a significant effect in
Model 2. To test H3, Model 3 included all effects as Model 1 except social influence. H3 would be
confirmed if we found no effect of intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes in Model 1 but a
significant effect in Model 3. To test H4, Model 4 contained all the effects as Model 1 and the effect
of exposure to outgroup peers. This effect was operationalized as the number of outgroup peers in a
network. In Model 4, we also controlled for the exposure to majority peers and its interaction with
ethnic minority membership, which can be also understood as a sign of ethnic diversity in a school
grade and whether the impact of such diversity on outgroup attitudes differs between majority and
minority students.
Results
Descriptive Results
correlated with their attitudes towards Turks. This result was replicated in the case of Poles as the
outgroup. We conducted a simple cross-lagged model, in which we regressed attitudes towards
Turks at T2 on the number of friends with a Turkish background while controlling for attitudes
towards Turks at T1 (b = .09, SE = .02, p < .001). In this model, the values of students with a Turkish
background were labeled as missing and, thus, not considered by the model. This result was
replicated in the case of attitudes towards Poles when the number of Polish friends at T1 was
associated with attitudes towards Poles at T2 while controlling for attitudes towards Poles at T1 (b =
.12, SE = .06, p = .042). These findings showed a positive association between intergroup friendship
and outgroup attitudes when relying on correlations or simple cross-lagged models. These
approaches, however, do not draw on the benefits of SAOM, which could control for tendencies such
as social influence or homophily. Therefore, these links between intergroup friendship and outgroup
attitudes could be spurious, which will be tested and closely examined in this research.

The Investigation of Attitudes towards Turks
studied using SAOM, including intergroup friendship, social influence, and homophily effects. As
typically found in SAOM studies, findings indicate that intergroup friendship did not affect outgroup
attitudes (majority: est = .04, SE = .05, p = .439; minority: est = .04, SE = .03, p = .270), students
selected similar peers as friends with respect to gender (est = .40, SE = .02, p < .001) and ethnicity
(est = .17, SE = .02, p < .001) but not outgroup attitudes (est = .11, SE = .08, p = .147), and friends
exerted social influence over students (est = 2.51, SE = .53, p < .001). Score-type test confirmed that
the effect of intergroup friendship had no value to explain the development of outgroup attitudes (
2 = 1.6, p = .450).
H2 was not supported by this analysis because excluding homophily from Model 2 did not lead to a
significant effect of intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes (majority: est = .03, SE = .05, p =
.501; minority: est = .03, SE = .03, p = .299). When we excluded social influence in Model 3, H3 was
supported among both majority and minority students (majority: est = .11, SE = .04, p = .007;
minority: est = .10, SE = .03, p = .002), whose outgroup attitudes became linked to intergroup
friendship, as compared to Model 1, which included social influence and showed no link. As shown in
Model 4, the exposure to outgroup peers affected outgroup attitudes (est = .13, SE = .05, p = .005), a
finding which supports H4.

The Investigation of Attitudes towards Poles
Findings reported in the previous subsection in which we examined attitudes toward Turks were
essentially replicated when we examined attitudes toward Poles: in Model 1, intergroup friendship
did not affect outgroup attitudes (majority: est = -.003, SE = .08, p = .968; minority: est = .11, SE = .08,
p = .192); as shown by homophily tendencies, students tended to select peers with the same gender
(est = .40, SE = .02, p < .001) and ethnicity (est = .18, SE = .02, p < .001) but not similar outgroup
attitudes (est = .02, SE = .08, p = .820) as friends; and these friends influenced them as shown by the
effect of intergroup friendship had no value to explain the development of outgroup attitudes ( =
1.6, p = .440).
Again, H2 was not supported, as excluding homophily tendencies did not lead to a significant effect
of intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes (majority: est = -.01, SE = .08, p = .968; minority: est =
.11, SE = .08, p = .192; see Model 2). H3 was supported in the case of the minority students (est = .17,
SE = .08, p = .037), but not the majority students (est = .06, SE = .07, p = .402), when excluding social
influence led to a significant effect of intergroup friendship on their outgroup attitudes (see Model
3). In the case of attitudes towards Poles, H4 was again supported, as the exposure to outgroup
peers had a positive effect on outgroup attitudes (est = .16, SE = .04, p < .001) that did not differ
between majority and minority students (est = .06, SE = .09, p = .524; see Model 4).

Summary of Study 2
In Study 2, we confirmed that the effect of intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes was not
found in a typical SAOM model (Model 1), while it was found in correlations or when using a simple
cross-lagged model. According to our findings, the reason why SAOM studies report no effect of
intergroup friendship on outgroup attitudes is because such studies control for social influence. This
conclusion was confirmed in three out of four tests (see Models 2 in Tables 2 and 3); when we did
not control for social influence, we found a significant effect of intergroup friendship on outgroup
attitudes. We did not find a significant effect of intergroup friendship in the one test that measured
the effect of intergroup friendship on attitudes toward Poles among the majority students. This is in
line with previous research which found that intergroup contact with any ethnic group does not
necessarily lead to a change in outgroup attitudes (Zingora et al., 2020). The findings of Study 2
support the conclusion that intergroup friendship is unrelated to outgroup attitudes in school
settings when crucial tendencies that shape students’ attitudes and behaviors, specifically social
influence, are controlled for.
On a positive note, the results of Study 2 offer evidence that the exposure to outgroup peers was
positively related to improvements in outgroup attitudes. This finding indicates that intergroup
friendship is not essential to shaping outgroup attitudes, and supports the hypothesis that a different
and more easily applicable form of intergroup contact – the exposure to outgroup peers – could
suffice to improve outgroup attitudes.
General Discussion
By conducting a meta-analysis and an empirical study, we aimed to investigate the puzzling findings
reported in SAOM studies that denied a link between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes.
While intergroup friendship has long been upheld as the cornerstone of the intergroup contact
theory used to inform approaches to improving outgroup attitudes (Paolini et al., 2007; Pettigrew,
1997; Turner et al., 2007), our analysis revealed compelling evidence that intergroup friendship does
not inherently result in more positive outgroup attitudes.
Our preregistered meta-analysis (Study 1) identified strong evidence that intergroup friendship did
not automatically lead to improvements in outgroup attitudes. Multiple researchers have called for
the application of analytical approaches such as SAOM to study social phenomena and intergroup
contact (Dovidio et al., 2017; Mason et al., 2007), but the number of studies conducted in this way is
still limited. Despite the fact that our research is therefore limited by the small number of available
studies to draw from, we are confident in our conclusion because such SAOM studies typically rely on
relatively large samples and, by the nature of the analysis, on longitudinal data.
In Study 2, a seemingly positive link between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes was found
to be attributable to social influence. While we found a significant link between intergroup friendship
and outgroup attitudes could be identified through correlations or a simple cross-lagged model,
SAOM models which controlled for social influence showed a non-significant link between intergroup
friendship and outgroup attitudes. Generally, the robustness of conclusions reported in Study 2 was
strengthened by replicating these findings in the investigation of attitudes towards two ethnic
groups, Poles and Turks.
Our investigation has revealed that social influence has an effect on the relationship between
intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes. Omitting social influence between friends could lead
to a significant relationship between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes. Some positions
within a school grade or some friendship groups themselves could be characterized by being exposed
to influence, either direct or thought intermediaries, of peers with positive intergroup attitudes.
These positions could be likely occupied by students who have intergroup friends. Failing to account
for social influence could thus produce a link between intergroup friendship and improved outgroup
attitudes that in fact reflects students being exposed to and influenced by the positive outgroup
attitudes that already exist within their friendship group.
Results indicate that exposure to outgroup peers was positively related to outgroup attitudes. The
higher the number of outgroup peers in a school grade, the more positive development of outgroup
attitudes among students. Our findings make a strong case against segregation in schools: having
outgroup classmates can support the development of more positive outgroup attitudes.
Those who try to facilitate friendships in order to improve outgroup attitudes face several key
challenges: a) each student can maintain a limited number of friendships, and it is questionable
whether anyone should intervene in their choice of friends, especially if befriending one person
decreases the likelihood of befriending someone else, b) students might be reluctant to form
intergroup friendships, and c) it may be impossible for a student to cultivate friendships with peers
from every walk of life. Exposure to outgroup peers as classmates in schools can overcome these
challenges. We look forward to reviewing the results of future research that capitalizes on SAOM to
investigate the effects on attitudes of exposure to outgroup peers in school settings. We especially
encourage researchers to inspect contextual factors such as intergroup conflict or segregation
present in a school on the effect of the exposure alone on outgroup attitudes.
In this research, the application of SAOM led to unique and novel findings. SAOM represents a crucial
tool not only for the investigation of social phenomena, especially intergroup contact, but also for
avoiding the reporting of inaccurate findings resulting from omitting the dynamic tendencies that
influence interpersonal relationships. We are looking forward to more SAOM studies being
conducted and published on intergroup contact, and we hope that our research will open new
avenues for more extensive investigation of intergroup contact in schools. We recommend future
research to test our conclusions outside of school settings and investigate whether intergroup
friendship is essential to shaping outgroup attitudes in other contexts in which social influence could
also be an important socialization tendency. We further encourage researchers to investigate social
influence, a tendency that has been repeatedly shown to be a major force in the development of
adolescents, as a means to improve outgroup attitudes in schools. Considering social influence as
well as intergroup contact as approaches for improving outgroup attitudes could help us devise new
and efficient strategies to steer the development of positive outgroup attitudes among students.
Our findings should be interpreted in light of at least one limitation: the geographical constraint of
the samples. Studies used in the meta-analysis as well as the sample investigated in Study 2 were not
located in a diverse set of countries. Future research should aim to replicate our conclusions in
different, ideally non-Western, samples. Our results should be also carefully evaluated in terms of
causality. Although we applied a state-of-the-art analytical approach and studied longitudinal data,
we cannot draw causal relations with certainty.
Conclusion
The present research consistently and robustly demonstrated that intergroup friendship in schools is
not automatically positively related to outgroup attitudes. Capitalizing on the analytical capacities of
SAOM, we found that a positive link between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes appeared
only when we did not control for social influence. We believe that our study illustrated the
importance of investigating the dynamic nature of interpersonal relationships and their effect on the
development of students’ outgroup attitudes, and that exposure to, rather than friendship with,
outgroup peers had a positive effect on outgroup attitudes. We hope that our research will facilitate
continued investigation into the impact of intergroup contact on outgroup attitudes, using
approaches that take into account the dynamic nature of relationships and the extent to which social
influence shapes such attitudes.
