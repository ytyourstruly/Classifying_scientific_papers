Abstract
We study pension planning and financial wealth of natives and immigrants (N=1177) in the
Netherlands, in relation to their temporal values (past/future-focused), financial knowledge, IQ, and
other individual characteristics. We find that, compared to natives, immigrants are less financially
literate and rely more on the government for their retirement income, but are more future-focused and
think more about their retirement. Second, controlling for financial knowledge, IQ, saving intention,
health, self-control and demographic factors, temporal values help to predict many aspects of pension
planning: how much people think about retirement, their desired retirement age, whether they develop
a plan to save for retirement, perceived saving adequacy, and home ownership. Furthermore, temporal
values predict savings and financial wealth in 2016 and 2020, even after controlling for the financial
situation in 2016. In conclusion, habitually attending to the past leads people to give less priority to the
future compared to the past, which has consequences for people’s planning and behaviour such as
retirement planning and financial well-being. Our results have strong implications for policies related
to pension communication and contribute to the theory on relationships between economic decisions,
time and cognition.

Introduction
Pension reforms in many countries have shifted a large part of the responsibility for an adequate
standard of living after retirement from the government, employers, or pension providers to individuals
and their households. Individuals increasingly must make their own decisions, while on the other hand
many people do not think about their future and do not have the interest or the knowledge to make such
decisions in a conscious or optimal way.
Immigrants are potentially a vulnerable group that has not gained much attention in pension studies.
Their financial preparation for retirement may be influenced by human capital, social-demographic,
financial knowledge, linguistic barrier, and psychological factors (e.g., Lusardi & Mitchell, 2011; Topa,
Moriano, & Moreno, 2012). The rocketing number of immigrants combined with the aging problem and
the associated increasing focus on pensions urge us to analyze life-cycle differences in retirement
planning and financial wealth between natives and immigrants. For example, Statistics Netherlands
predicts that the Dutch population with a migration background will increase from 24.5% (2021) to
30%-40% in 2050. It is hardly known as to whether and how Dutch immigrants prepare differently for
retirement from natives. This study aims to better understand factors that influence retirement planning
and financial wealth for immigrants and native Dutch. Particularly, we not only for the first time show
how financial literacy and IQ jointly predict pension planning, but emphasize the importance of a
previously unexplored factor - cultural temporal values, which goes beyond the effects of financial
literacy, IQ or other individual characteristics.
Factors influence pension planning
Studies have identified many demographic and psychological factors that can influence people’s
retirement planning, such as financial knowledge, saving intentions, future time horizon, and financial
risk tolerance (e.g., Hershey & Mowen, 2000; Hudomiet, Carvalho, & Rohwedder, 2018; Tanaka,
Camerer, & Nguyen, 2010; van Rooij, Lusardi, & Alessie, 2011a). For example, individuals with a
higher level of financial literacy are more likely to develop a retirement plan and think more about their
retirement (e.g., Bucher-Koenen & Lusardi, 2011; Jacobs-Lawson & Hershey, 2005; Lusardi &
Mitchell, 2014; van Rooij, Lusardi, & Alessie, 2012). However, what remains less clear is whether
financial literacy reflects knowledge or rather ability and cognition (van Rooij, Lusardi, & Alessie,
2011b). Despite the well-established impact of IQ on economic decisions (e.g., Burks et al., 2009;
Ginblatt, Keloharju, & Linnainmaa, 2011), no study on pension planning has so far directly used
measurements of individuals’ IQ. Additionally, institutional differences may influence people’s pension
planning. For example, many Dutch may trust their pension fund instead of involving in their own
planning, whereas Americans more often plan their pension by themselves (van Dalen, Henkens, &
Hershey, 2010). Moreover, subjective reports of health have important effects on retirement, the effect
of which is argued to be even stronger than financial variables. For example, McGarry (2003) found that
changes in retirement expectations are much more affected by changes in health than by changes in
income or wealth.
Interestingly, with a quite different view, Chen (2013) claims that the structure of languages can
influence people’s economic behaviour and retirement savings. Languages such as English and French,
that grammatically separate future and present are called strong future time reference languages (e.g., “It
is raining now”; “It will rain tomorrow”), whereas weak future time reference languages such as Dutch
or German, do not have this feature (e.g., “Nu regent het”; “Morgen regent het”) (Chen, 2013; Thieroff,
2000). Chen (2013) proposes that strong future time reference languages make the future feel more
distant and make individuals less aware of the future consequences of their current behaviour, reducing
future-oriented behaviour such as saving (linguistic-saving theory). His cross-country analysis showed
that speakers of weak future time reference languages save more. The within-country comparisons
between individuals with an identical background except for different home languages revealed that,
controlling for cultural values (whether saving is considered important and thriftiness is appreciated),
language still influences saving (e.g., in Brussels, individuals who speak Dutch save more than those
who speak French).
A number of studies follow Chen’s (2013) theory (e.g., Liang et al., 2018; Sutter, Angerer, Glätzle-
Rützler, & Lergetporer, 2018), but the major problem with Chen’s hypothesis is that he assumes that
there is a link between language structure and the perception of the distance of the future (and further
influences inter-temporal choice), but this important premise is not tested in his study or grounded on
any empirical evidence. In particular, lab experiments showed that there is no effect of linguistic
grammar of future time references on the perceived distance of future events (Jäggi et al., 2022), and
several well-controlled experiments failed to replicate Chen’s hypothesis (Chen, He & Riyanto, 2019;
Thoma & Tytus, 2017). Chen also failed to replicate his own results when the original data set was re-
analysed while controlling for cultural evolution (Roberts, Winters, & Chen, 2015).
In spite of the criticisms, Chen’s idea on a possible link between time perception and future-oriented
planning or behaviour should be valid (e.g., Earl et al. 2015; Webster, Bohlmeijer, & Westerhof, 2014).
Especially, compared to the richness of research on various aspects of pension planning and adjustment,
there are very few studies exploring the relations between people’s thinking about time and their future
retirement planning (Adams & Rau, 2011; Zacher, 2013, 2014). To study associations between time
perspective and economic or management outcomes, researchers often use the Zimbardo Time
Perspective Inventory (ZTPI; Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999) that considers time as multidimensional,
including the past, present, and future. Time can have different types of affection. For example, the past
can be divided into the past negative and past positive types. The former focuses on negative personal
experiences in the past and the latter takes a nostalgic view of the past focusing on “good old days”.
Research shows that time perspective can associate with work-related well-being and achievement
(Drake et al, 2008; see the review of Levasseur et al., 2020). Typical ZTPI items include “Painful past
experiences keep being replayed in my mind”, “Happy memories of good times spring readily to mind”,
“I complete projects on time by making steady progress”, etc. Arguably, some items in ZTPI are mixed
with risk aversion.
Researchers using the ZTPI measure have found that individual differences in cognitive engagement
with time are related to retirement planning (e.g., Hershey & Mowen, 2000; Kerry, 2018; Mooney, Earl,
Mooney, & Bateman, 2017). For example, Earl et al. (2015) explored the time perspective as a predictor
of pension planning and possible consequences on the well-being of 367 Australian retirees. They found
that future time perspective helps to predict individuals’ retirement planning, but does not predict
retirement outcomes such as retirement adjustment, life satisfaction, well-being, etc. Additionally, these
authors admit that their results can be cofounded with procrastination due to some ZTPI items.
People’s sense of time differs across cultures (e.g., Callizo-Romero et al., 2020; Carstensen, 2006), and
people with different cultural temporal focus may attach different monetary values to past or future
events (Guo et al., 2012). Taking cultural values toward time (i.e., habits of attending to past or future
events) as an example, people from specific (sub)cultural groups tend to focus more on past times and
older generations, they are more observant of ancient rituals, and place more value on tradition, whereas
people from other cultures can have a greater focus on the future, valuing economic development,
globalization, and technological progress. People who are habitually attending to past events may
metaphorically tend to place the past in front of them, “in the location where they could focus on the
past literally with their eyes if past events were physical objects that could be seen” (de la Fuente et al.,
2014, p.1684). If people, regardless of cultures, put important things in front of them and leave less
important things behind (Callizo-Romero et al., 2020), habitually attending to the past is likely to make
people give less priority to the future compared to the past. Temporal values can therefore have
consequences for their pension planning and their actual behaviour, potentially influencing their well-
being in the long run.
So far time perspective or temporal values and pension planning have been rarely studied in a cross-
cultural context (Earl et al., 2015) or with a focus on immigrants. In this study we fill this gap in the
literature by investigating the impact of overall temporal values on immigrants’ pension planning,
homeownership, retirement savings and financial wealth, comparing immigrants with a control group of
native Dutch. Unlike most studies which do not control for participants’ other characteristics that may
relate to the pension planning (and hence time can operate as a moderator), we additionally measure
many important factors such as participants’ IQ, financial knowledge, risk aversion, saving intention,
patience, health, self-control and income. Particularly, IQ can be a good proxy of ability, which can
provide a better understanding of the relationship between financial knowledge, cognition and pension
planning. Furthermore, to better understand the effect of temporal values, we study their relations to
participants’ riskless assets and financial wealth both concurrently in 2016 and longitudinally four years
later.
Data
We used survey data for the Netherlands collected in 2016, 2020 and 2022. We designed a special
questionnaire with a set of questions including general values toward time (temporal focus
questionnaire, de la Fuente et al., 2014, shortened version , e.g., future values item: “It is important to
innovate and adapt to the new changes.” Past values item: “The traditional way of living is better than
the modern way.”, see all items in Appendix 1), retirement planning, risk aversion (van Rooij et al.,
2011), IQ (Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices Test, Raven, 1976; shortened version , Bilker et al.,
2012), self-control, time preference (patience), saving intention, demographic information, etc. This
questionnaire was administered in 2016, when we also obtained information about participants’ savings,
and financial wealth. Furthermore, participants who originally took the survey in 2016 were interviewed
again in 2020 for their savings and financial wealth and in 2022 for their homeownership (we do not
have information about other aspects in 2022). In addition, we gathered participants’ self-assessed
general health status (1-5) in 2016.
List of questions related to retirement planning
Q1. How much responsibility do you think generally a government should have for ensuring a
reasonable standard of living for retired people? (1='It's entirely everyone's own responsibility, …,
9='It's entirely the responsibility of the government').
Q2. How much have you thought about retirement? (A lot, some, a little, or hardly at all)
Q3. If you were able to choose for yourself, at what age would you want/have wanted to stop
working? (only for respondents performing paid work and older than 44 years.)
(Yes/No)
Q5. If participants answered “Yes” to Q4, they were asked “Have you developed a plan for
retirement?” (Yes; More or less; No). Combining answers of these three categories and “No” from Q4,
for retirement) and a plan has been developed; I have tried and a plan has been more or less developed; I
have tried but no plan has been developed; I have never tried (“No” Q4).
1 Four items about temporal focus were chosen from de la Fuente et al.’s (2014) temporal focus questionnaire, which originally had 21
questions. The four items were selected based on a preliminary survey to about 100 people using the 21 items and chose the four items
whose TFI had a correlation of 0.8 with that of 21 items.
2 There were four items in total, three of which were from Bilker et al., 2012’s norming study, which can predict 78-91% of the total
Raven’s test (60 items). To increase item discrimination, we additionally selected one item from the Raven Advanced Progressive
Matrices. The score was coded as the number of correct answers.
Q6. Choose your answer on a scale of 1 to 9, with 1 'disagree completely' and 9 'agree totally'. “I am
saving enough to retire comfortably”.
Q7. Do you own the house you live in? (Yes; No)
Invitations to answer this questionnaire (in Dutch) were sent to 1471 participants in the LISS panel,
administered by CenterData (Tilburg University, The Netherlands) in 2016. The LISS panel is a
representative sample of Dutch individuals of age 16 and older, covering immigrants from many
countries of origin and representative in terms of gender, age, education, income and other domains.
There were 1177 respondents (M =46.69, range 25-66, SD=11.89, 646 females, 531 males), including
age
659 immigrants (361 first-generation and 298 second-generation immigrants). We excluded participants
who are retired (n=74). Due to participants’ unwillingness of providing some information or dropping
out of the survey between 2016 and 2020, we miss certain information for some participants and lose
participants over years (e.g., the sample size of financial wealth is smaller than others, see details in
observations in regression output tables). The sample is oversampled in immigrants but is representative
in terms of important background characteristics, as those who failed to provide income and financial
information in 2016 do not differ from others in their means of age, education, IQ, marriage, self-
control, patience, or temporal values (all p>.1). The only exception is that females are less willing to
reveal their financial wealth than males are (p=.079).
Data analysis plan
Dependent variables
Pension planning, perceived saving adequacy and owning of dwelling We generated three dependent
variables on the role of government’s/individuals’ responsibility for ensuring retirees’ living standard
(government), how much people think about their retirement (thoughtretire) and their desired retirement
age (retireage) (Q1-3). Then we generated three dependent variables on whether participants have
figured out how much they need to save for retirement (figout_amnt_sav, Q4), whether they developed a
saving plan for retirement (retire_plan, Q5), and whether they perceive themselves to have adequate
savings (perceive_sav_adeqc, Q6). For Q7, we generated a dependent variable on whether participants
own the house they live in (dwelling) in 2016 and 2022.
Savings and financial wealth We generated six dependent variables on participants’ riskless assets
(savings) and financial wealth in 2016 and 2020, which were log-transformed except 0 values (sav16;
finasset16; sav20; finasset20).
Independent variables
For our key variable on temporal values, participants rated the degree to which they agreed on the
statement at a scale of 1-9 (1=completely disagree; 9=total agree). Based on scores testing future values
items and past values items, we generated a Temporal-focus Index (TFI) for each participant: TFI =
(mean of future values score − mean of past-values score) / (mean of future-values score + mean of past-
values score) (de la Fuente et al., 2014). TFI ranges from −1 to 1, where −1 represents (completely)
past-focused, 0 represents present-focused and 1 represents future-focused.
Additionally, we generated the following independent variables: health, IQ, risk aversion, patience (time
preference), financialknowledge, self-control, education (high; low), saving intention, income (log-
transformed), and eight group dummies DutchNative, Turkey, Morocco, Indonesia, Surinam,
Netherlands Antilles, otherNonWestern, otherWestern. Moreover, we generated standard demographic
variables female, age, marriage, number of children, etc.
Ordered probit models were used to analyse the ordinal dependent variables government, thoughtretire,
retire_plan or perceive_sav_adeqc, probit regressions for binary dependent variables figout_amnt_sav
or dwelling, and OLS regressions for dependent variables retireage, sav or finasset.
In addition, three sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, we replaced the TFI with the original
cultural past temporal values and future temporal values to check which temporal values are significant
and which values have a larger impact. Second, because the effects of TFI and Age can be non-linear,
we used a generalized additive model (a generalized linear model, Wood, 2017) in which the linear
response variable depends linearly on unknown smooth functions of some predictor variables (TFI and
Age). Third, as Age usually negatively associates with TFI (de la Fuente et al., 2014) but also relates to
our dependent variables, we ran GAM models while excluding Age or TFI to check the robustness of
results of TFI.
Results
Some descriptive results of main variables (e.g., financial literacy, IQ, TFI) and a histogram of TFI can
be found in Appendix 2 and Appendix 3. In general, comparing the raw data, immigrants (M=2.10,
SD=1.07) are significantly less financially literate than native Dutch (M=2.38, SD=0.90) (all p’s<.05 for
all groups, exceptions are Indonesians, p=.84, and western immigrants, p=.31). Immigrants (M=0.02,
SD=0.19) overall have a significantly larger TFI (more future-focused) than native Dutch (M=-0.013,
SD=0.20, p=.003), but separately, immigrants from Turkey, Morocco, Netherlands Antilles and Surinam
(all p’s>0.12) are not significantly more future-focused than native Dutch. Finally, controlling for IQ (β
=0.28, p<.001), education (β=0.32, p<.001), gender (β =-0.21, p<.001), age (β=0.007, p<.001), risk
aversion (β=0.10, p<.001), and other factors, TFI (β=.58, p<.001) significantly predicts financial
knowledge.
Pension planning, saving adequacy, and home ownership
First, we describe what people think about the government’s responsibility for ensuring a living standard
of retired people (Q1), how much they think of retirement (Q2) and their desired retirement age (Q3).
Results show that (1) people who have a larger TFI, a better health situation, have higher education, less
self-control or more patience tend to think that individuals should be more responsible for their
retirement income. (2) people who have a larger TFI, who are older, more patient, financially more
literate with higher income think more often about their retirement; (3) people who have a larger TFI,
older but better health and a stronger risk aversion (p=.086) hope to retire later; and (4) immigrants
(especially Moroccans) significantly more often think it is the government’s responsibility to ensure a
sufficient standard of living during retirement. They also think more often about their retirement than the
native Dutch (e.g., Indonesian) even though there are no differences in desired retirement age. In short,
the results show that, keeping other factors constant, TFI predicts how much people think about
retirement, the extent to which they think it is the government’s instead of the individuals’ responsibility
effect sizes and details).

past research, individuals’ financial knowledge, marital status, income, self-control, age and number of
children are significant predictors. Beyond these factors, TFI, perceived government responsibility and
IQ (for RQ4) significantly influence pension planning. Specifically, controlling for other factors, those
who have a larger TFI (p=.003; p=.017), a higher IQ, and less trust in the government’s responsibility
have a higher probability of knowing how much they need to save for retirement and on developing a

based upon ordered probit models are plotted with OLS estimates (the same variables are consistently

For perceived savings adequacy (RQ6), individuals who have a larger TFI (p=.029) are more likely to
think that they have adequate savings for retirement, controlling for demographic factors (marriage,
children number, income, age, all ps<.01), health, saving intention, trust in government’s responsibility,
patience (all ps<.001), self-control (p=.007), risk aversion (p=.792), education (p=.154), IQ (p=.07) and
financial knowledge (p=.610). Compared to Dutch natives, immigrants (except Turkish, Surinam and
other non-westerners) more often perceive their retirement savings are inadequate.
Finally, for home ownership (RQ7), participants who have a larger TFI (AME=0.15, p=.035) are more
likely to own their dwelling in 2016, controlling for significant factors of health (p=.003), age (p=.002),
financial knowledge (p=.012), income (p=.043), marital status (p<.001), number of children (p<.001)
and education (p=.076). In comparison to native Dutch, only immigrants from Turkey (p=.85) and
Western immigrants (p=.10) are not significantly different whereas immigrants from Morocco (AME=-
0.53, p<.001), Netherlands Antilles (AME=-0.20, p=.005), Suriname (AME=-0.13, p=.015) and other
non-Western (AME=-0.17, p<.001) and Indonesians (AME=-0.08, p=.054) are significantly less likely

financial wealth is expected to increase by about 26.11%, 37.99% and 24.86% in 2016, 2022 and

immigrant groups in 2016 and the differences (about 314% ~ 1949%) remained for all groups in
2020 (except the “other western” p=.316 and Indonesia p=.378 groups). However, when the baseline
financial wealth in 2016 is controlled for, only Turkish (p=.013) and Surinam (p=.023) and other
non-western groups (p=.087) have significantly less financial wealth than the Dutch.
Sensitivity analyses
Splitting TFI into past temporal and future temporal values
Given the persistent significant effect of TFI, we further replace the TFI with the original cultural
past temporal values and future temporal values to check which temporal values have a larger
impact. Interestingly, for questions related to future pension planning and retirement thinking, both
past and future temporal values have significant influences but in an opposite direction (Q1-7 except
Q2). Surprisingly, for results related to financial facts such as savings and assets, it is mainly the past
temporal values that negatively predict the savings and financial wealth in 2016 and 2020, whereas
focused are more likely to have more savings and financial wealth concurrently and in the future,
while keeping demographic information and other controlling variables constant.

Examining TFI using nonlinear GAM model
It could be that TFI and age may have a non-linear impact on pension planning and financial wealth,
so we built a GAM model by fitting the data of TFI and age each with a smoothed (non-linear) term.
Age usually has a negative association with TFI (de la Fuente et al., 2014), but when age and TFI
both positively affect the dependent variables, it is more justified to include age in the model when
examining the effect of TFI to avoid this potential omitted variable. This is also reflected in the
fitness of model, as the adjusted R of model decreased when a significant variable age is dropped
planning, savings and financial wealth are robust, regardless of whether including age in the model.
Furthermore, TFI is not a proxy of age, as when TFI is dropped in the model, age itself is not
dependent variables are linear except four (government, desired_retire_age, figout_amnt and
own_dewelling16).

Discussion
In this paper we use survey data to study native Dutch and immigrants’ pension planning,
homeownership, retirement savings, and financial wealth in the Netherlands. In addition to
considering many important factors such as financial literacy, education and health, we introduce
temporal values, IQ and other individual characteristics into pension planning study. We first
discover that people’s temporal values can predict the extent to which they think about retirement
and the government’s responsibility for ensuring the living standard of retired people. Furthermore,
individuals’ TFI, IQ, and perception of the government’s responsibility have significant effects on
their pension planning, beyond well-known factors of financial knowledge, health, income, self-
control, saving intention, age, etc. Importantly, we find that temporal values can not only predict
participants’ homeownership, actual savings, and financial wealth concurrently in 2016 but also
several years later, even after controlling for the baseline in 2016.
In comparison to the Dutch natives, immigrants from Morocco rely more on the government’s
responsibility for ensuring retirement income and think more often about retirement, and are less
Turkish, Surinam and other non-westerners) subjectively feel that their retirement savings is less
adequate, and immigrants from Morocco, Netherlands Antilles, Suriname, and other non-western
backgrounds are less likely to own a dwelling. Additionally, all immigrant groups have less savings
and financial wealth than Dutch natives.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that people’s perception of time has
such a long-term relationship with financial well-being. We found that individuals’ TFI persistently
predicts their retirement planning, dwelling ownership, savings, and financial wealth even after
controlling for financial knowledge, IQ, health and other significant factors. Immigrants are
generally more future-focused than the native Dutch, which well explains why immigrants, though
less financially literate, still think more often about their pension than the native Dutch. Our study
makes both practical and theoretical contributions.
First, the findings have strong implications for policy related to pension planning: (1) The low level
of financial literacy among immigrants suggests that policy measures to improve the level of
financial literacy targeted at vulnerable groups can also be targeted at these immigrants; (2)
educators and social media can induce people to focus less on the past but more on the future; (3)
policy should target tailor made pension communication to specific groups (e.g., Morocco),
particularly with current ongoing pension reforms that put more responsibility with the individuals
themselves.
Second, the study contributes to the debate as to whether financial knowledge measures knowledge
or simply ability and cognition (e.g., van Rooij, Lusardi, & Alessie, 2011b). Our results show that
financial literacy has a significant positive influence on retirement planning but the effect becomes
smaller in size when IQ is additionally controlled for. This suggests that financial knowledge can be
partially mediated by IQ, given that a higher IQ may lead to higher financial knowledge. This urges
researchers to consider a better control for individuals’ cognitive ability in pension planning studies.
Furthermore, past studies have shown that people’s time preference (patience), future time
perspective (e.g., Jacobs-Lawsona & Hershey, 2005) or future horizons (van Rooij et al., 2011) can
have an impact on their pension planning. However, these measurements only study the extent to
which one thinks about the future with a reference point of now and do not consider the extent to
which one thinks about the past or the magnitude differences between one’s thinking about the past
and the future. In the current study we measure participants’ temporal values towards both the past
and the future and compute the temporal focus index to represent whether a participant is relatively
past- or future-focused. The innovative finding is that both future and past temporal values are strong
predictors of retirement planning, but people’s past temporal values appear to be a better predictor
and have a stronger effect size than the future temporal values in predicting fact-based savings, assets
and wealth.
These results contribute to the theory of temporal focus (cf. Shipp et al., 2009). Past research shows
that people’s temporal values can explain their mental space-time mappings as to whether
individuals put a past or future event in front of or behind them (Callizo-Romero et al., 2020; Gu,
Zheng & Swerts, 2019). Given that people usually prioritize important things in front of them and
leave less important things behind, we propose that habitually attending to the past is likely to lead
people to give less priority to the future compared to the past. Thus temporal values can have
consequences for people’s planning and behaviour, influencing retirement planning and financial
well-being in the long term. Indeed, our results reveal associations between temporal values,
retirement thinking, pension planning and economic outcomes. Our study has moved important steps
forward from a cross-cultural comparison of labelling of past and future events as a function of
individuals’ temporal focus, and further shows that habits of more attending to the past or future
predict people’s overall well-being concurrently and longitudinally. If temporal values affect
planning and behaviour, we expect that the effect of temporal values on wellbeing may be
generalised to other aspects such as health behaviour, smoking, diet, disease, wages, happiness, etc.
One caveat of the current study is whether the associations between TFI and the outcome variables
are causal effects. First, TFI is found to be negatively associated with age, e.g., 80 years old people
are more past-focused (smaller TFI) than 20 years old students (de la Fuente et al., 2014), but that is
likely to be a cohort effect rather than a change of TFI over years within a person. Particularly, when
age positively correlates with some dependent variables such as pension planning, TFI does not
negatively correlate with the dependent variables but also has a positive correlation. This shows that
TFI is not a proxy of age. Furthermore, our sensitivity analysis shows that the effect of TFI is robust
when age is excluded or controlled for.
Second, one may argue that the TFI effect can be affected by health. Although it is possible that an
individual’s momentary temporal focus is impacted by some extreme health condition, this is less
likely to be the case for TFI in this study. On the one hand, TFI is still significant after controlling for
health and the results are largely robust when we exclude health in the regressions. On the other
hand, health is not significant in predicting many dependent variables (e.g., figure_out_amount)
regardless of whether we include TFI or not, while TFI is always significant.
More importantly, people’s values are generally stable, like a personality. Most research on temporal
focus has framed it as a trait-like, general characteristic. Shipp (2020) reviews that change in
temporal focus is mainly fixed after childhood and general temporal focus is relatively stable during
most of one’s adult life (Aspinwall, 2005). Furthermore, neuroscience research reveals that the
general tendency to focus more on the past or the future relates to brain function and certain brain
regions (e.g., Szpunar, Watson, & McDermott, 2007) and such a biological basis for mental temporal
thought may be relatively stable (Shipp, 2020). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the TFI in
our study is stable, especially only over a short period of 4-5 years.
Nevertheless, it could be the case that better financial conditions make people less past-oriented (the
reverse causality). To better understand the possible causal effect of temporal values, we have
additionally controlled for a number of important related individual characteristics (e.g., IQ, financial
literacy, health, self-control, risk aversion, saving intention) that affect pension planning and
financial wealth, and have used longitudinal predictions for several years later, but we still find an
effect of TFI in predicting the future. Of course, there might be an omitted variable that influences
both an individual’s TFI and all the dependent variables, though it is difficult to imagine what the
variable may be. If that is the case, we have discovered a powerful marker of a deep omitted variable
that can cause differences in pension planning and financial wellbeing.

Time preference (patience) (1=disagree completely, 9=totally agree)
I am willing to sacrifice my well-being in the present to achieve certain goals in the future.
Financial future time perspective (1=disagree completely, 9=totally agree)
I live for the present and don’t think about my financial future.
Saving intention (1=I immediately spend all my money, 9=I want to save as much as possible)
Suppose you have money that remains after having paid for food, rent, and other fixed or
necessary expenditures, what would you do with the money?
2 An alternative interpretation of the effect could be the degree of conservative and innovative attitudes. In the literature,
conservatism is considered as a social attitude and defined as resistance to change (e.g., Honderich, 1990). However, Pienaar, Beukes
and Esterhuyse (2006) found that at least for adolescents, high levels of conservatism experience high levels of psychological well-
being, which seems to have a reversed relationship direction to our finding.
