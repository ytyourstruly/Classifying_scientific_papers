ABSTRACT
Cooperation is essential for human societies, but not all individuals cooperate to the same
degree. This is typically attributed to individual motives - for example, to be prosocial or to
avoid risks. Here, we investigate whether cooperative behavior can, in addition, reflect what
people pay attention to and whether cooperation may, therefore, be influenced
by manipulations that direct attention. We first analyze the attentional patterns of subjects
playing one-shot Prisoner’s Dilemma games and find that choices indeed systematically relate
to attention to specific social outcomes, as well as to individual eye movement patterns
reflecting attentional strategies. To test for the causal impact of attention independently
of subjects’ prosocial and risk attitudes, we manipulated the task display and found that
cooperation is enhanced when displays facilitate attention to others’ outcomes. Machine
learning classifiers trained on these attentional patterns confirm that attentional strategies
measured using eye-tracking can accurately predict cooperation out-of-sample. Our findings
demonstrate that theories of cooperation need to incorporate attention and that attentional
interventions can improve cooperative outcomes.
INTRODUCTION
Cooperation – the ability of individuals to incur a personal cost to achieve a group benefit – is
1,2 3
a hallmark of human social behavior and is essential for the functioning of our societies .
Understanding why people engage in cooperation rather than behaving selfishly, and how we
can foster cooperation, is important for many pressing global challenges, including
combatting climate change, curbing infectious diseases, and addressing problems associated
with aging populations.
Natural selection implies competition, but cooperation is observed in both animal and human
groups . Evolutionary biology offers several potential explanations for the emergence of
5,6
cooperation, including kin selection, reciprocity, byproduct benefits, and group selection .
To understand and improve cooperative outcomes in human behavior, it is crucial to pin down
the specific motivations and decision mechanisms underlying cooperative choices .
The existing literature suggests several possible motives underlying cooperation. First,
cooperation may depend on the outcomes of the decisions. This is suggested by lab studies
using economic games such as the Prisoners’ Dilemma, where two individuals choose to
either cooperate or defect in the presence of a trade-off between individual and group
outcomes. These games represent many real-world situations where an individual has the
incentive to free-ride and take advantage of others - for instance, group projects, the use of
public goods such as parks and transportation, or the division of household chores. A vast
behavioral literature exploring individual and group behavior in various possible designs,
settings, and conditions of these games has developed in economics, psychology, and
sociology since the early 1960s . In these studies, most individuals do not cooperate or defect
categorically but choose systematically whether to cooperate in line with the relative size of
9–15
the different payoffs .
Second, individual differences in cooperation may reflect individual beliefs and preferences.
16–19
Most prominent in this respect may be social or other-regarding preferences : People
often cooperate with strangers due to their concern for other people’s wellbeing , but could
21–23
also do so due to other motives such as “warm glow” or empathy . Non-social preferences
related to specific circumstances may also influence cooperation. For example, cooperation
can break down due to risk aversion: One might refuse to vaccinate due to personal fear of
potential health issues. If another person then suspects that such an individual will not
reciprocate and could therefore put their personal outcome (e.g., health) at risk, they might
also choose not to engage in cooperation .
Finally, in addition to incentives and individual preferences, cooperation may also relate to
attention and sampling of the information on which the choices are based. Studies using
25–32
choice process data, such as gaze duration and saccades , have revealed that subjects do
not pay equal attention to all pieces of information but vary considerably in their eye
movement patterns . This suggests that individuals shift their overt attention in line with
simplified information sampling strategies, often not using all available information to the
34,35
same degree . This may partially reflect goal-directed attention guided by preferences and
choice strategies. For example, in social dilemmas, individuals with strong other-regarding
preferences exhibit gaze patterns favoring others’ payoffs . Moreover, individuals who tend
to play closer to equilibrium strategies – or who use a higher level of strategic sophistication
– pay attention to both their own and their opponent’s payoffs, whereas individuals who fail
to play the equilibrium strategies only sample their payoffs . Finally, other studies suggest
that altruistic individuals attend to both players’ payoffs, whereas selfish ones often only
sample their own payoff .
Attention is not only guided by behavioral goals but can also be driven exogenously by
39–41
characteristics of the environment and the choice-relevant stimuli , such as the
42 43
positioning or visual salience of different choice attributes. However, previous studies of
cooperative behavior have mainly examined goal-directed attention and have by and large
not considered how behavior may relate to how attention can be captured exogenously, for
instance by changing the salience and location of the payoff information on the screen. This
contrasts with the literature on choices in non-social contexts, where it has been consistently
shown that value-based choices are strongly affected by exogenous attention
44–46
manipulations . For instance, studies on food choice have shown that the visual salience
of an item leads to a stronger behavioral preference towards the item , and corresponding
exogenous attention manipulations during moral decisions have shown that directing the
48,49
attention of individuals to specific answers can also affect their choices .
Here, we integrate these separate perspectives and investigate how attentional information
sampling subserving cooperative decision-making depends on both individuals’ preferences
and exogenous manipulation of information presentation. To disentangle the effects of
outcomes, preferences, and attentional mechanisms on cooperative decisions, we use one-
shot Prisoner’s dilemma (PD) games combined with computational choice models and eye-
tracking. Such PD games involve four distinct payoffs: reward (R) for mutual cooperation,
temptation (T) for one-sided defection, punishment for mutual defection (P), and sucker’s
payoff (S) for one-sided cooperation. In a one-shot PD game, typically T > R > P > S, so the
dominant strategy for a player is to always defect, as this strategy guarantees a higher payoff
(T or P) independent of the opponent’s choice. If both players defect (as they should do in
Nash equilibrium if they are rational and optimal), they both receive a punishment payoff P,
a worse outcome than they could have obtained if they had cooperated (R).
In our experiment, subjects played 192 trials of this game with a real opponent seated in a
separate room and did not receive feedback on the opponent’s choice after each game. To
capture the effects of outcomes and distinct motives on cooperative choices in different
individuals, we systematically varied the four payoff values. Specifically, we generated 96
unique PD games, by varying the four payoffs between 0 and 40, with a step size of 5 Swiss
estimate individual other-regarding preferences, risk attitudes, and subjective prior beliefs
about potential cooperation by the opponent. The one-shot games we used circumvented
other dynamic factors that could also influence cooperation, such as belief updating or direct
50,51
reciprocity .
To evaluate the effects of information sampling on cooperation, we presented the games to
subjects (N = 88) as a 2x2 matrix and used a high-precision eye tracker (SR Research Eyelink
1000) to record subjects’ gaze-dwelling times and saccades (see Methods) and estimate their
attention to different aspects of the payoff displays . To study exogenous attentional effects,
we randomly alternated across trials between placing cooperative payoffs for the subject and
their opponent in the left and right columns, fully crossed with the top and bottom rows
1a), thereby manipulating the salience of the different payoff values. These manipulations
allowed us to test for the effects of both visual salience and option positions on information
sampling patterns linked to cooperative decisions. The location of options on the screen has
53,54
indeed been associated with differences in information sampling through habitual gaze
37,42,55
patterns associated with left-to-right, up-to-down reading conventions in most Western
56,57
languages .
While previous studies of social decision-making have focused on aggregate gaze
37,38
patterns , we additionally studied individual temporal dynamics of gaze sequences and
two columns (labeled A and B). The chosen option was indicated by yellow frames. After a short inter-trial interval (ITI = 1.5
s) a new choice was presented. b. Payoff matrix: the subject (YOU) and opponent (OTHER) chose between Defect and
Cooperate (labeled A and B, with labels counterbalanced across subjects). If both subjects cooperated (resp. defected) they
both received the reward payoff R (resp. punishment payoff P). If the subjects choose different options, the subject who
cooperated received the “sucker’s payoff” S and the subject who defected received the temptation payoff T. c. Values of the

how they interacted with habitual viewing patterns and visual salience, leading to changes in
the information sampled under different positions of payoffs on the screen. These
manipulations and analyses allowed us to establish a clear causal link between attention and
choices. We had no prior hypotheses on the complex relationship between the cooperative
choices, gaze data, and our display manipulation, so we clearly indicate that our results are
primarily exploratory. However, we used pilot data to confirm that individuals do respond to
trial-by-trial variation in payoffs. Additionally, we replicated some of the behavioral analyses
METHODS
Subjects
We recruited 88 healthy volunteers (48 females, aged 18 to 35 years old, mean: 24.6, std: 3.1)
from the subject pool of the Department of Economics at the University of Zurich to take part
in the eye-tracking experiment. We determined the target sample size (N = 84) needed to
estimate a significant correlation (significance level of 0.05, power 80%) between an
individual’s eye tracking measures and behavioral measures such as cooperation rate,
assuming a weak relationship with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.3.
In parallel, another set of 88 subjects recruited from the subject pool of the Department of
Economics at the University of Zurich participated in a simultaneous fMRI session and acted
as partners in the task. All subjects were right-handed, medication-free, and with normal or
corrected-to-normal eyesight (using contact lenses). All subjects provided written informed
consent. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Canton of Zurich. The study
was not preregistered.
Task
trial, two subjects (main subject, playing columns, and their opponent playing rows) chose
between two options labelled “A” and “B” (corresponding to cooperation or defection, with
labelling counterbalanced across subjects). The payoffs were determined by the choices of
both players, leading to four possible outcomes. If both players cooperated, they both earned
the reward payoff (R). If they both defected, they both earned the punishment payoff (P < R).
If one player cooperated but the other one defected, the player who defected earned the
temptation payoff (T > R) while the player who cooperated received the sucker’s payoff (S <
P). We did not use the words “cooperation” or “defection” anywhere in the instructions or
display to avoid influencing the subject’s choices. Instead, subjects chose between a left and
a right column, labelled A and B, and were told that the other player chose between the top
and bottom row, also labelled A and B. The meaning of the letters (cooperation/defection)
remained constant for each subject and was counterbalanced across subjects. We
manipulated the position of the defect or cooperate columns and rows within-subject. The
position of rows and columns was randomly determined for each trial and counterbalanced
throughout the experiment.
At the end of the experiment, one trial was randomly selected, and the decision of the second
player was shown to the subjects. This trial was then paid according to the choices of both
subjects, with one point corresponding to 1 Swiss franc (around 1 USD at the time of the
experiment). The subjects were also paid a 20 CHF show-up fee.
Trial presentation and timing
We implemented the task in Matlab 2018b, using the Psychophysics Toolbox 3 extension .
On each trial, subjects were presented with a new payoff matrix, displayed as four squares
containing the potential payoffs of the subject (“you”) and the second subject (“other”)
represented as numbers and green (for “you”) and orange (for the “other”) rectangles. The
had a maximum of 15 seconds to choose either A or B by pressing the left (for the left column)
or right (for the right column) arrows on the keyboard. As soon as they chose one option, a
yellow square framed the column selected for 1.5s, and the payoffs disappeared for 1.5s
the other player until they completed all trials.
Trial construction
We systematically varied the four possible payoffs (reward R, temptation T, sucker’s S, and
Prisoner’s Dilemma games where payoffs could take values between 0 and 40 points with an
increment of 5, and where the following rules were respected: T > R, P > S, R > P, T > S, and
2R > T + S. This procedure yielded 96 distinct games. Each subject played each game twice (96
games in random order in the first half, and the same 96 games in random order in the second
half).
Experimental session
We brought the eye-tracking and fMRI subjects to the lab separately to make sure they
remained anonymous. Both subjects were informed of the existence of another subject
playing the same game in an adjacent room, and that one of their mutual choices would be
implemented at the end of the experiment. The eye-tracking subject entered the lab after the
fMRI subject had started the experiment and sat in a separate room. At the end of their
session, eye-tracking subjects waited until the fMRI session was over. Both subjects received
simultaneous feedback on one randomly selected trial.
After completing a short comprehension quiz and two practice trials, eye-tracking subjects
completed two blocks of 96 trials of the task each. At the end of the experiment, subjects
filled out a short demographic questionnaire, stating their age, sex, nationality, field of
studies, religious and political orientation, monthly disposable income, family affluence, and
community size.
Eye-tracking recording
Eye tracking subjects sat at a distance of 55cm from a 22ʺ screen on which we displayed the
task using a resolution of 1920×1080 pixels. Subjects placed their heads on a chinrest to
reduce head movements and were instructed to hold their position for the duration of the
block. We recorded eye motion using an infrared EyeLink 1000 Plus eye tracker system (SR
Research Ltd.), sampling the gaze position and size of the subject’s pupil at 2000 Hz. We
calibrated the eye tracker before each block of 96 trials using a standard 5-point calibration
routine.
Eye-tracking processing
We used the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) position of the subject’s gaze to measure the
saccades and fixations between 12 areas of interest (AOI) on the screen (Supplementary
(“other”) for the four possible outcomes (R , R , P , P , S , S , T , T ). We recorded all gazes
Y O Y O Y O Y O
inside each AOI, occurring during the choice phase (between the stimulus onset and the
subject’s response) and lasting longer than 100ms for each trial. We recorded the sequence
of fixations (AOI and location on the screen) and the duration of each fixation.
We additionally computed heatmaps of eye positions, using any x and y position (within or
that most fixations occurred within our predefined AOIs.
To analyze differences between games and subjects, we computed trial-level metrics, using
aggregates of all fixations for a trial. We computed the total time spent sampling each AOI
and divided these values by the reaction time (duration of the trial) to obtain the relative time
spent sampling each AOI on each trial. We additionally analyzed the first, second, and last AOI
sampled on each trial.
As a second proxy measuring the importance of each AOI during a trial, we computed the
frequency of fixation to the different AOIs. As noted in a previous eye-tracking experiment ,
this number strongly correlated with the time spent looking at each AOI (Supplementary
subjects, adjusted R-squared > 0.53 for all AOIs). We therefore restricted our analysis to the
relative time spent sampling each AOI.
Computational models of cooperation
To distinguish different motives of cooperation, and characterize individual differences in
choice mechanisms, we built a series of computational models of cooperation. We considered
16 87
three factors that can influence cooperation: other-regarding preference , beliefs , and
risk , and included them in a single model, estimating the utility of cooperation using the
following equations:
! " "
𝑈(𝐶𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒) = 𝑝 ⋅ 𝑅 + (1 − 𝑝) ⋅ 1(1 − α)𝑆 + 𝛼𝑇 7,
! ! !
𝑈(𝐷𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡) = 𝑝 ⋅ ((1 − α)𝑇 + α𝑆 ) + (1 − 𝑝) ⋅ 𝑃 ,
where 𝛼 represents other-regarding preference, i.e., preference for high payoffs for the
opponent (𝛼 = 1 indicates a full consideration for the opponent’s outcome and no
consideration for one own’s outcomes, while 𝛼 = 0 indicates no consideration for others and
full consideration for self), 𝑝 represents the fixed individual beliefs about the opponent’s
action, since it weighs the outcomes resulting from the opponent’s cooperation versus
defection (thus 𝑝 = 1 represents a certain belief that the opponent will cooperate and 𝑝 = 0
a certain belief that the opponent will defect), and 𝜌 represents risk aversion using a standard
power function with diminishing marginal utility.
To fit the subjects’ choices, we used a softmax function, computing the probability of
cooperation on each trial t using the difference in utility between the two options ∆𝑈 =
𝑈(𝐶𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒) − 𝑈(𝐷𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡) :
𝑃(𝐶𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒) = ,
1 + 𝑒#$∆&
where β is the inverse temperature (β = 0 when subjects choose at random, high β values
for deterministic choices).
We fitted the model to the subject’s choices using the standard maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE), using a random grid search and optimization procedures in R. We restricted
the model fitting to subjects who had enough variability in their data for the model to fit,
excluding subjects who defected (or cooperated) on less than two trials (22 subjects),
resulting in a sample size of 66 subjects. The parameter recovery results are shown in
We compared the winning model to a set of alternative models, using the Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC) as a goodness-of-fit measure (see Supplementary Tables 8 and 9
for the full description of the models and comparison). Alternative models included: (1) a
model that implements the risk aversion transformation after implementing other-regarding
preferences, (2) a model that included a constant bias toward cooperation or defection, (3) a
model with α = 1 (fully selfish), (4) a risk-neutral model with ρ = 1, (5) a model with 𝛼 = 1
(fully selfish) and a constant bias, (6) a model with a CARA risk aversion function , (7) a model
with a CRRA risk aversion function 88 , (8) a model with constant risk-seeking (ρ = 1.1), (9) a
model with the Charness-Rabin social preference function . We found that all these models
provided a worse fit to the data than the winning model; however, differences between the
winning model and the risk-neutral (as well as constant risk-seeking) model were not
significant.
Statistical analysis
We analyzed the effects of payoffs, options position, and gaze patterns using generalized
mixed effect models implemented in R (R Core Team 2017), using the lme4 package. We
analyzed trial-by-trial choices (cooperation vs defection), and binary eye metrics (first gaze to
“you” vs “other”, first gaze to payoffs, etc.) using mixed-effects logistic regressions (glmer,
probit link function) including random intercepts and slopes for all independent variables for
each subject. We analyzed the effects of option position on fitted model parameters using
fixed effects linear regression, and the effects of positions and payoffs on gaze duration and
gaze frequency using mixed-effect linear models including random intercepts and slopes for
each subject.
Out-of-sample predictions of cooperation
We used the trial-specific gaze patterns of each subject to obtain out-of-sample predictions
of cooperation. We used random tree classifiers (fitctree implemented in MATLAB) trained
on features representing the fixation of each AOI at different time points and predicting the
binary outcome (cooperate vs defect) on individual trials. Specifically, we either dummy-
coded the fixation to an AOI on a specific time point (first, second, third, or last fixation) or
used the value of the sampled payoff on each fixation to create 32 possible features (8 AOIs
x 4 fixations). We used the outcome of each trial (cooperate or defect) as labels. Using a leave-
one-subject-out cross-validation procedure, we trained the classifiers using different
combinations of features (either all or some fixations, or all or some AOIs) on all but one
subject and predicted the trial-by-trial cooperation for the left-out subject. We then averaged
the predicted cooperation, either across games for each subject, or across subjects for each
game, and compared these out-of-sample predictions to the real subject- or game-specific
cooperation rates using mean-squared-error (MSE). We additionally trained simpler
classifiers, using as features the relative dwell time of each AOI on each trial, or the values of
the four different payoffs on each trial, to compare the performance of classifiers trained on
sequences versus summary variables.
Since our dataset was misbalanced (23% of cooperation trials and 77% of defection trials), we
additionally computed the chance level-cooperation rate by shuffling the training-set label 50
times on each cross-validation iteration and predicted the cooperation on the left-out trials
using the classifiers trained on these permutations. We estimated the chance to predict a
cooperation rate at around 0.2.
We compared the game- and subject-based goodness of fit (MSE) of classifiers trained on one
fixation only (first, second, or last) or on a combination of these fixations (first-to-second and
last, first-to-third and last) using all AOIs and either dummy variables or variables containing
the normalized payoff being sampled during the fixation (value of the AOI’s payoff, divided
by the sum of all payoffs of the trial). We additionally compared classifiers trained using data
from one AOI only, using normalized payoffs and all fixations (first to third and last).
RESULTS
Cooperation depends on payoff values, in line with other-regarding preferences
Subjects cooperated on average in 23% of the trials. Importantly, cooperation rates were
stable between the first and second parts of the experiment, both on the subject level
(Pearson correlation r = 0.9, t(64) = 15.9) and the game level (Pearson correlation r = 0.72,
t(94) = 10.05). The data showed significant individual differences in cooperation rates (from
0%, observed in 8 subjects, to 100% in 1 subject). These differences may reflect variations in
the underlying motives for cooperation. To determine the influence of such motives on
Methods for details). The values of all four payoffs affected cooperation (Supplementary
Cooperation increased with larger values of the reward R and sucker’s payoffs S (both of
which subjects can receive when choosing to cooperate) but decreased with the larger
2a). Given that the subjects played many rounds of the game, we also tested for serial effects
and found no influence no significant effects of the previous trial’s payoffs (R, P, T, S) on the
current trial’s choice (mixed effects regression of choice on previous trial R, P, T, S; all p > 0.4).
The systematic variations of payoff values across trials allowed us to fit a computational
choice model that could disentangle several factors that may influence cooperation. This
model computed the utility of different choice options based on a combination of the
different payoffs, weighted by their link to other-regarding preferences (preference for high
payoffs for other, 𝛼), prior beliefs about the other subject’s choice to cooperate (𝑝), and risk
aversion (𝜌, exponentially discounting the values of uncertain outcomes):
𝑈(𝐶𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒) = 𝑝 ⋅ 𝑅 ! + (1 − 𝑝) ⋅ 1(1 − α)𝑆 " + 𝛼𝑇 " 7,
𝑈(𝐷𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡) = 𝑝 ⋅ ((1 − α)𝑇 ! + α𝑆 ! ) + (1 − 𝑝) ⋅ 𝑃 ! ,
We used these utility functions as inputs to a standard softmax choice function (see
Methods). Fitted parameters showed a high correlation between individual’s other-regarding
r(86) = 0.86, p < 0.001), but no simple correlation between cooperation and prior beliefs (r(86)
= 0.09, p = 0.48) or risk aversion (r(86) = 0.01, p = 0.94), and no correlation between beliefs
and social preferences (r(86) = -0.18, p = 0.14). When controlling for all model parameters,
we found that risk aversion also explained a part of the variance in cooperation rates (R
without 𝜌: 0.75, R 2 with 𝜌: 0.81; coefficient for 𝜌in the full model: 𝛽 = -0.35, t(62) = 4.4, p <
0.001). In the model that assumed risk neutrality, the belief parameter was a significant
predictor of cooperation (𝛽 = 0.16, t(62) = 2.4, p = 0.02).
Previous studies showed a link between both social and risk attitudes evaluated in a separate
58,59
task and behavior in the Prisoner’s Dilemma game . However, when comparing alternative
models (see Methods), we did not find a strong difference between the winning model and a
model that assumes risk-neutrality (ρ = 1). This suggests that individual risk preference did
not play an important role in the subjects’ decisions and that social preferences were the
primary source of variability across individuals.
Cooperation rates are linked to goal-directed attention to payoffs
Previous studies established that goal-directed information sampling relates systematically to
37,38
social preferences and individual traits that are linked to cooperation. We confirmed
these links between individual differences in cooperation and information sampling by
tracking the subject’s eye movements throughout the choice period until the decision. We
defined several areas of interest (AOI) on the screen, placed around the 8 payoff values
payoffs T , R , P , S and opponent’s payoffs T , R , P , S ) and measured the fixations on each
Y Y Y Y O O O O
AOI, their duration, and their temporal position during gaze sequences on each trial (see
Methods for more details on the eye-tracking recording and processing).
First, we focused on individual differences and investigated how each subject’s aggregated
gaze behavior related to differences in cooperation rates. The relative time subjects spent
sampling different AOIs was indeed significantly correlated with their cooperation rates
relative sampling times for each subject and AOI and subject-specific cooperation rate, p <
0.001 for all AOIs except for R : p = 0.93). One exception was the sampling of own reward R,
which was not linked to differences in cooperation. The results were similar for the trial-by-
effect logistic regression of relative sampling times on trial-by-trial cooperation:
individual preferences, we found that other-regarding preferences estimated using our utility
model were correlated with the relative time subjects spent sampling the other’s payoffs
between social preferences and preferential sampling of other’s payoffs .
Cooperation is influenced by option positions
While these results confirm that cooperation is linked to individual differences in goal-
directed attention, they do not imply a specific causal relation between information sampling
and cooperation rates. Do preferences determine where people look, or are people’s
preferences influenced by what they look at? While our data cannot answer this question
conclusively, we note that preferences and goals are not the only possible influence on
subjects’ attention: Attention can also be captured exogenously by features of the
environment, like specific spatial positions that people habitually attend first, or other visual
features that attract attention. We therefore capitalized on such bottom-up influences in
visual sampling, to exogenously manipulate attention and test for the causal effect of this on
cooperation.
To identify these bottom-up effects, we randomly permuted the positions of the options on
the screen on each trial, in a within-subject and counterbalanced manner, independently
from the payoff values presented. In half of the trials, the column corresponding to
cooperation for the subject was placed on the left (vs right) of the screen, fully crossed with
whether the cooperation option for the other was placed in the top or bottom row. This
resulted in four possible combinations, which we labelled Mutual Cooperate-up-left, Mutual
1d). Note that for each of these spatial configurations of the payoffs, people may attend to
their own payoffs or those of the other in each cell, which we measured with eye tracking.
These changes in the position of the options had a significant effect on cooperation.
Surprisingly, the cooperation rate was higher for trials in which the cooperate option of the

Including interactions between the payoff values and option positions in the regression did
decisions were causally affected by where the cooperation option was presented, regardless
of the payoff values. To ensure no serial choice effects were affecting these results, we tested
for the interaction between the option positions and the previous trial choice. This revealed
no significant effects (mixed effects regression of the current trial choice on the previous trial
choice, interaction with row order, p = 0.65), confirming that the effect of spatial option
position was not confounded by temporal patterns of attention allocation.
To explain these results, we first tested whether the effects of these exogenous manipulations

whether individual differences in model parameters were linked to differences in the effects
of the option position manipulations, but we found no such link (p > 0.2 for all Pearson’s
Second, to test whether the option positions may alter subjects’ preferences, we fitted the
choice model for each row and column position separately. We found that the subject’s other-
regarding preference and risk aversion were not significantly different across positions
p > 0.5 for all positions). However, the parameter quantifying the subject’s belief about the
probability of cooperative choice by the opponent was significantly different for the two row
This suggests that placing the opponent’s cooperative options in the lower part of the screen
might lead subjects to expect their opponent to cooperate with a higher probability (across
all trials, independent of the payoff variation).
Option positions influence cooperation through changes in gaze sequences
Changing the option positions on the screen may affect information sampling processes
through interactions with habitual gaze patterns such as reading top-to-bottom and left-to-
right. A possible explanation is that these positions affect the information sampled during
the first saccade of each trial. Indeed, the histogram of gaze location during the first 300 ms

and sampled more frequently the payoffs located on the left vs right column (59% of trials;
paired two-tailed t-test of left vs right column row frequency, p < 0.001). However, we found
that subjects cooperate more when cooperation is placed on the bottom, while they start by
sampling the top row. To identify what may underlie this counterintuitive effect, we first
examined other features that may drive attention.
In addition to the locations of the payoffs, their denominations and values may also have an
effect on exogenous capture of attention - in particular, because self versus other payoffs had
specific spatial arrangements within each cell, and large payoff values correspond to large

To summarize, cooperation increased when the cooperate row was placed on the bottom,
even though the top row (corresponding to defective outcomes) was typically sampled first.
Cooperation rates are predicted by specific gaze sequences
Previous research has shown that not only the first saccade, but more complex gaze strategies

such as scan paths, or gaze sequences, may be linked to differences in decision-making .
This suggests that exogenous manipulations of option positions as employed here may
influence cooperation not only via their effects on first saccades but also by triggering more
complex extended gaze sequences. To test for these links between gaze sequences and
cooperation, we extracted the order of fixations occurring on each trial.
We first analyzed the effects of the first three fixations for each trial (a larger number was not
computationally tractable for some of the analyses). This showed that cooperation was

sample cooperation rates across subjects and games, using gaze sequences and payoff
We found that the best predictions were obtained when using the first four and the last

subject-specific predicted vs measured cooperation rate r(86) = 0.78, p < 0.001, game-specific
predicted versus measured cooperation rate r(86) = 0.72, p < 0.001). Thus, not only the first
fixations but sequential information sampling up to at least the fourth fixation was strongly
linked to cooperative decisions.
Gaze sequences are affected by spatial option presentation
The results until now show that cooperation rates are affected not just by first fixations, but
also by subsequent saccades. This suggests that the spatial arrangement of the different
options can influence not just where people look first, but the full sampling sequence. To test
for these effects, we first computed the four most frequent fixation dyads for each option
position, and the cooperation rate for trials starting with these sequences (averaged across
fixation dyads for each option position, which lead to different cooperation rates. The Mutual
Cooperation-down-left condition provides the most striking example, where a first fixation on
the other’s temptation (located in the upper left cell), followed by a vertical saccade to the
other’s reward leads to a cooperation rate of 48%, compared to 27% when own punishment
is fixated second. Exogenously driving subjects’ attention to a high payoff for others
(associated with defection) located on the top-left part of the screen therefore can lead to
high cooperation, but mainly when subjects follow a specific sampling sequence after the
initial gaze.

that is linked to the left-to-right top-to-bottom writing and reading conventions that are
the norm for most subjects of our sample (predominantly students of European background).
Our results show that such a sampling pattern, combined with the nature of the payoffs
located in the upper left area, can lead subjects to sample different AOIs and thereby
influence their cooperation rate.
Changes in gaze sequences drive subjects’ attention to other’s payoffs
In this last analysis, we focus on the differences in the type of information that is sampled in
the different option positions, as a result of the changes in gaze sequences discussed before.
First, the different option positions may attract the subjects’ attention toward the payoffs of
the opponent within a specific cell and lead them to increase their consideration of other’s
outcomes in their decision. We indeed found that when the cooperate option was placed on

Subjects who had a stronger difference in time spent looking at the other’s payoff between
the two column positions also had a slightly larger increase in their cooperation rate for the
at other’s payoff and cooperation rates between two column positions, r(86) = 0.35, p =
0.011). This suggests that individual cooperation was influenced by the position of the
columns, via subject-specific attention attraction to the payoffs of others.

This pattern of results may reflect individual differences in subjects’ goal-directed intentions
or capacity to overcome a first-gaze bias. Indeed, sampling the cooperation row when it is
influence cooperation. Sampling cooperation payoffs in the bottom row, on the other hand,
is not habitual. Subjects who overcome the pattern and sample the cooperation AOIs despite
their location have a higher cooperation rate, suggesting that the subject-specific capacity to
overcome a first-gaze-to-the-top-row bias is linked to cooperation. In line with this
interpretation, the difference in cooperation between the row positions was strongly
correlated with the differences in the relative sampling time of the cooperate row between
and cooperation rates between the two row positions, r(86) = 0.49, p < 0.001). The option

effect of cooperation placed left on sampling other’s information, and the effect of
overcoming attentional bias on sampling cooperation information. This may explain the

demonstrate that longer sampling of the other’s payoff is associated with higher cooperation
to higher cooperation rates. This suggests that the effect of specific option positions on
cooperation may be mediated by how a specific option position attracts attention and
therefore fixation on this option.
To confirm this mediation effect between the separate observations, we performed the
following analyses: In the mixed effects regression model showing the effect of the row order
on cooperation, we included the two effects that are thought to be responsible for the
identified effects: either the total duration of sampling of the other’s payoffs or a dummy
variable indicating that the second fixation was to the other’s Reward payoff. In both of these
analyses, including the mechanism variable led to the effect of the order becoming
insignificant (p = 0.88 and p = 0.9), indicating that this effect is primarily mediated by the gaze
variables.
To confirm this statistically, we ran two mediation analyses that underlined that row order
affects cooperation through the gaze variables: Both tests showed that the effect of the row

indicator of the second fixation being the other’s Reward payoff).
DISCUSSION
Our results demonstrate that cooperative behavior is not only affected by the potential
outcomes of social interactions and individual preferences but also by attentional
mechanisms (at least when outcomes are viewed on a computer screen as here). Attention
to others’ payoffs was associated with increased cooperation rates, on both the individual
and game levels. Exogenous manipulations of the payoff presentation, orthogonal to the
manipulation of payoff values, changed subjects' gaze patterns, leading to changes in
cooperation rates. Subjects’ attention at the beginning of a trial was naturally attracted to the
top-left part of the screen and to higher payoffs. Changes in the option presentation therefore
affected which payoff information was sampled by the subjects, leading them to specific
sampling sequences (importantly, increasing the chance to sample payoffs of the opponent).
Sequences of fixations to the different payoffs, combined with the payoff values, predicted
trial-by-trial cooperation rates, showing the importance of information sampling patterns in
cooperative decisions.
Our study is the first to systematically evaluate cooperation decisions using a wide range of
payoffs within the same subject, allowing us to simultaneously estimate beliefs, risk, and
other-regarding preferences using one-shot Prisoner’s Dilemma games. Previous studies have
shown that cooperation in such games was influenced by the different payoff values, with
simplified indices derived from payoffs used to predict cooperation across games and showing
9–15
the importance of different motives in cooperation decisions . Here we used a different
approach, explaining individual rather than group behavior using utility models based on
standard economic choice assumptions such as risk preferences (stemming from diminishing
59 16
marginal utility) , other-regarding preferences , and expected utility calculation using prior
beliefs. Using an extensive set of models, we found that individuals’ behavior was best
captured by a combination of other-regarding preferences and beliefs about the opponent’s
choices, while risk preferences (on average) did not play an important role. In our study,
however, outcomes were deterministic and only depended on both subjects’ choices. Studies
using stochastic outcomes could be conducted to evaluate the link between risk preferences
and cooperative behavior in settings closer to real-world decisions.
37,38
Previous studies have linked cooperative behavior to information sampling patterns ,
showing that gaze directed at others’ payoffs is typically associated with cooperation. These
studies, focusing on goal-directed (endogenous) attentional mechanisms, highlight individual
differences in cooperation that can be associated with different sampling strategies,
reflecting individuals’ levels of pro-sociality , rationality (playing according to game-theoretic
predictions), and strategic sophistication . Supporting these findings, we found that subjects
who attended to the opponent’s payoffs – and in particular the opponents’ reward –
cooperated more, while subjects attending primarily to their payoffs often defected. These
60,61
effects may reflect that people with the ability to mentalize and employ theory-of-mind
may focus attention on others’ outcomes to determine whether to cooperate. In addition to
these subject-level effects, we found that within-trial gaze sequences that included the
opponent’s payoff were also associated with an increased cooperation rate for those trials.
To disentangle the informational and preferential components of these attentional effects,
future studies could use an asymmetric payoff matrix that orthogonally manipulates rewards
for the subject and their opponent, creating an additional incentive to sample own or other’s
payoffs.
We found that exogenous manipulations affecting bottom-up attention impacted
cooperation. Simple permutations of option positions on the screen affected individual
cooperation rates, independently from choice outcomes or individual preferences. We found
that these manipulations did not significantly affect the estimations of risk and social
preferences, but instead changed the assumed prior beliefs about cooperation. These results
provide new insights for the important debate on the question of whether attention (affected
for instance by gaze manipulation) can change the way preferences are constructed or
47,62
whether it purely affects the choice process itself . Previous studies focusing on the effects
of goal-directed attention have shown an effect of attention on the subjective values
26,62,63
attributed to attended options , which may partly explain behaviors such as preference
64–66 67
reversal or instability .
Studies exogenously driving attention to some choice options in non-social domains found
47,68,69
that such manipulations can bias choices . Extending such exogenous manipulations to
social decisions, we found that stimulus-driven attention affected information sampling and
choices, but not estimated social preferences. These findings suggest that even though our
display manipulations changed attention towards the other’s payoffs, they did not seem to
change the perception of inequality (captured by the social preference parameter of the
model) but instead appeared to increase prosocial tendencies overall (captured by the
cooperation belief parameter). These findings suggest that new models may be needed that
explicitly address the interplay between these factors that influence subjective valuation
processes underlying prosocial behavior.
Examining potential causes of such bottom-up attentional effects, we found that a habitual
37,55
information sampling pattern , attributed to the left-to-right and up-to-down Western
56,57
writing conventions , may partially underlie these effects. Simple alterations of choice
interfaces, such as changing the position of the options presented therefore influence
53,70,71
information sampling and choices by interacting with this natural pattern. Neural
evidence suggests that initial information processing plays an important role in social
decisions . Here we find that manipulating the position of the options on the screen changed
cooperation rates but did not increase the selection of the top-left option. Instead, after a
first fixation on higher payoffs placed on the upper part of the screen, more complex
mechanisms oriented subjects’ attention toward specific gaze sequences.
Previous studies of binary choices largely focused on the effects of the first and last fixations
26,47,73
as well as the relative dwell time of each option on decisions across multiple domains .
Cooperation decisions in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, however, are more complex, as four
different payoffs are represented for two different subjects, and the outcomes are conditional
on others’ decisions. Recent studies of multi-attribute decisions in non-social decisions have
extended findings that the first fixation and the relative dwell time of different options are
related to choices , and have shown that gaze allocations to options and attributes have
interactive influences on choices .
Studies on multi-attribute decisions in social dilemmas have focused on the frequencies of
transitions between fixations of different payoffs and found that these reflected distinct social
36,38 37
preferences in dictator games , or strategic sophistication in strategic games . However,
these studies did not evaluate the temporal structure of information sampling, and the
potential differential effects of fixations occurring in different temporal order. Our results
showed that the first and last fixations or overall dwell times were not sufficient to accurately
predict cooperation and that options sampled second had a high effect on behavior.
Going further than this overall dwell time, our analysis highlighted the importance of specific
sampling sequences and showed that the order of the fixations of different payoffs was key
to predicting cooperation. Using machine learning, we were able to accurately predict trial-
by-trial cooperation from four-fixation (three first and last) gaze sequences, with higher
accuracy than using the first and last fixations only, showing the importance of studying gaze
sequences. Scanpaths have been used in vision research to compare information-sampling
patterns across individuals or to improve users' experience in human-computer
76 77
interactions , and they have recently been applied to predict choices in economic games .
Here we showed that studying such paths in the context of cooperative decisions improves
predictions of behavior and allows us to explain the effects of exogenous manipulations of
attention on choices, by showing how positioning options at different locations on the screen
modified key information sampling patterns, not limited to the first information subjects
sampled. Extending our results to different games would allow us to test whether the gaze
patterns we measured here generalize across games and individuals.
Limitations
Modifying gaze behavior may affect the content of the information subjects consider for their
decision, or the way this information is processed. More work is needed to uncover the
specific computational mechanisms of individual differences in gaze strategies and how
exactly they influence choices. Further studies could manipulate the temporal presentation
49 78
of options , or the size and saliency of the different payoffs and response options, to
evaluate whether such stronger manipulations could further increase cooperation. Testing
our protocol with populations of non-western origin with different reading conventions, such
as right-to-left Hebrew or Arabic, or top-to-bottom Chinese or Japanese readers could
additionally provide more insight into how different habitual reading patterns combined with
manipulations of information presentation may affect social choices.
Finally, we only tested a simple manipulation of option presentation in a Prisoner’s Dilemma
and found that we could increase average cooperation rates. Our results demonstrate that
social behavior can be exogenously influenced toward more pro-social choices via clearly
measurable attentional mechanisms. Previous studies have suggested the general
79–81
importance of choice architecture for nudging behavioral outcomes . Our findings provide
a more mechanistic, attention-based account that could have an impact on the design of real-
world interventions, such as healthcare measures. One example could be new public health
policies, with printed information materials drawing individuals’ attention toward the specific
outcomes of their decisions for others may lead to an increase in cooperation. Another
potential application is in the charitable giving domain where it has been shown that drawing
82–84
attention to specific aspects of donations can increase charitable behavior .
