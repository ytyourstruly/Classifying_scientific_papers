Abstract
In this tutorial paper, we discuss cognitive networks as powerful models for understanding human
cognition and knowledge. Cognitive networks are representations of associative knowledge between
concepts in a cognitive system apt at acquiring, storing, processing and producing language, i.e. the
mental lexicon. In a cognitive network, nodes represent concepts with links expressing relations, such
as semantic, syntactic, phonological and visual connections, e.g. “canine” and “dog” (nodes) linked
by “being synonyms” (link). Hence, cognitive networks represent associative knowledge in
mathematical, measurable and quantifiable ways. Can such structure be used to gain insights over
cognitive phenomena? We explore this research question by reviewing recent, pioneering key
applications and limitations of cognitive networks across visual, auditory, and semantic language
processing tasks, either in healthy or clinical populations. We also review applications of cognitive
networks modelling language acquisition, reconstructing text content and assessing creativity or
personality traits in individuals. Our tutorial also gently introduces the reader to mathematical
notations, definitions and measures about single-layer and multiplex networks as well as hypergraphs.
Last but not least, across phonological, semantic and syntactic networks, we guide the reader through
relevant psychological frameworks, datasets and software packages that might all aid current and
future cognitive network scientists.
1. Introduction
The mental representation of linguistic knowledge is a complex system where several abstract
units - such as sounds, words and structures - interact together at multiple levels to convey knowledge,
meaning and emotions (Tulving 1972; Aitchison 2012; Zock 2020; Hills & Kenett 2021). The
complexity of such a cognitive system originates from the fact that “more is different”: Combining
ideas with specific features can create novel cognitive entities with distinctive characteristics, e.g.
“clause” (proposition) with “santa” (saint). Complexity is not limited to the spheres of meaning or
emotions but rather extends also to other aspects of knowledge. For instance, we have the ability to
remember and piece together phonemes (i.e. sound units) to form words as phoneme sequences
(Vitevitch 2008). We can also stack words to create sentences. When combined, multiple sentences
create narratives that shape ideas, viewpoints, emotions, and contexts, making all these aspects highly
interconnected. All this information is stored and processed across several cognitive mechanisms,
either sequentially or in parallel (Aitchison 2021; Doczi 2019). These idealised linguistic forms are
structured representations of knowledge as encoded within human cognition. Other examples include
mental images or conceptual frameworks, e.g. visualising a red apple when thinking about the concept
“apple” (Ciaglia et al. 2023). Notice that the terms “words” and “concepts” are distinct - words
represent linguistic units whereas concepts are cognitive reflections of ideas in the human mind
(Vigliocco et al. 2018). However, despite this distinction, since our focus is on modelling cognition
via models yet unable to distinguish between concepts and words, we use these two terms
interchangeably.
If concepts can be assembled together, shaping our knowledge systems, the necessity arises for
models that can elucidate, quantify, and explore such assembling or associative structures (Doczi
2019; Hills & Kenett 2021). These models should also focus on highlighting the interplay between
associative structure and other cognitive phenomena, dynamics and functions, grounded on such
organisation of concepts and ideas (Stella et al. 2017). In pursuit of this goal, cognitive modelling
introduced the metaphor of a mental lexicon (Collins & Loftus 1975; Aitchison 2012). Contrary to
its name, this is not a mere dictionary but rather a complex cognitive system, comprising multiple
interacting elements. The mental lexicon mostly includes semantic memory, acting as a repository
for linguistic knowledge about concept meanings (Sizemore et al. 2018; Kenett et al. 2018; Kumar
2021), alongside other subsystems handling phonological knowledge (Vitevitch 2008), visual cues
(Kennington & Schlangen 2015), and more (Doczi & Kormos 2015; Zock 2020). In this lexicon,
mental representations can share similar features, forming a “cobweb” of interactions influencing
knowledge acquisition, storage, processing, and production (Steyvers & Tenenbaum 2005; Aitchison
2012). This analogy aligns with the concept of a complex network (Collins & Loftus 1975) but with
a unique twist: links in the mental lexicon are “invisible” unlike those in physical systems, making
the structure of the mental lexicon inaccessible for direct, exact reproduction in a lab setting. For
instance, whether a researcher might explore and tinker with brain connections in the anatomy of a
real brain in a given lab setting, researchers cannot directly observe whether two ideas are encoded
as synonyms in an individual's mental lexicon but rather need to rely on external tasks or definitions,
i.e. indirect probing.
Consequently, the structure of the mental lexicon has to be indirectly investigated through
cognitive tasks. A key issue with these tasks is that they represent linguistic data without providing
insights into the cognitive structure of associative knowledge behind the data itself. For instance, the
data coming from a fluency task (see Section 2.6) remains a sequence of words, with no explicit
information about relationships between them. Hence, accessing only data from cognitive tasks still
misses information about how concepts are organised within human cognition. This research gap is
filled by network models, which act as representation proxies of the structural organisations of
concepts in the mental lexicon, with all due limitations relative to using proxies (Kenett & Hills 2022).
Notice that cognitive networks, the main topic of this tutorial, are not artificial neural networks
(Fatima et al. 2021). The latter are interconnected computational units, i.e. artificial neurons, which
can integrate or modify signals over time, thus possessing a distinctive computational power, e.g.
reproducing the OR logic. The cognitive networks reviewed in this tutorial paper are rather
representational models, i.e. they explicate the layout of conceptual relationships in associative
knowledge, even in absence of computational elements. Despite this distinction, cognitive network
science has grown over the years as a data-centric field, employing multidisciplinary techniques from
cognitive science, psychology, social science, mathematics, physics, statistics, and computer science
(Hills et al. 2009; Kenett et al. 2018; Siew et al. 2019; Siew & Castro 2020; Stella 2022).
This tutorial paper integrates excellent pre-existing reviews (Siew et al. 2019; Siew & Castro 2020)
by focusing on: (i) outlining the most recent advancements and cognitive interpretations in the field
focusing on network science methods and relevant literature as to appeal to computational scientists,
and (ii) reviewing the latest large-scale datasets and coding packages that can support computational
scientists in using cognitive networks as models for understanding human cognition and behaviour.
2. Basic Definitions
Let us start by defining in simple terms what is a cognitive network:
Definition 1: A cognitive network is a data-informed model explicating associations (links)
between cognitive representations of concepts (nodes).
Being data-informed implies that cognitive networks draw their insights and structure from empirical
data and psychological models (Siew et al. 2019; Stella 2022), reflecting real-world patterns and
interactions in combination with underlying theoretical assumptions and psychological constructs.
The phrase “explicating associations” underscores the networks´ ability to account for one or several
connections or relationships present between concepts in the mental lexicon, e.g. phonological
similarities (Vitevitch 2008), memory recall patterns (De Deyne et al. 2013), syntactic dependencies
(Stella 2020) and so on. Furthermore, “cognitive representations of concepts” pertains to the mental
constructs that individuals hold for various ideas or entities, ranging from meanings to visual,
phonological, emotional, and syntactic features, among others (Doczi & Kormos 2015).
Examples of nodes in cognitive networks include various linguistic elements, such as semantic
representations of words or idioms (one or more words conveying a unique meaning, e.g. “leap of
faith”). Morphemes capturing the root or stem of a word encode another type of node (e.g. “happi”
being the stem of “happiness”), as well as phonological transcriptions of words (see Fig. 1) and many
others (Doczi & Kormos 2015; Sizemore et al. 2018; Valba et al. 2021). Conceptual associations
within cognitive networks encompass a diverse array of aspects within the mental lexicon and include
semantic, phonological, syntactic, sensorimotor, affective, and visual aspects of the mental lexicon,
among many others (Martinčić-Ipšić et al. 2016; Stella et al. 2018; Siew et al. 2019; Castro & Siew
2020; Levy et al. 2021; Stella 2022). For instance, semantic associations involve connecting words
like “apple” with concepts sharing some features or overlapping in meaning, like “fruit” or “red”
(Doczi 2019). Phonological associations might be observed in recognising sound similarities between
words such as “cat” and “cab” (Vitevitch 2008). Syntactic associations involve understanding
grammatical structures, as demonstrated in sentences like “The cat looks at the cab” (Stella et al.
2022). Moreover, affective associations involve linking emotions to words, such as associating
positivity with “celebration” or negativity with “failure” (Semeraro et al. 2022). Lastly, mental
imagery can be evoked through visual associations - like imagining a beach, palm trees, and waves
when encountering the word “vacation” - and sensorimotor associations, illustrated by mentally
envisioning actions like riding a bicycle when the word “bike” is mentioned (Ciaglia et al. 2023).
Even psychometric networks (Golino & Epskamp 2017) would fall into Definition 1, although
their link construction is considerably more advanced (Golino et al. 2020) than the scope of this
tutorial paper. In fact, psychometric networks encapsulate correlations between numerical sets (e.g.
responses to items) and are thus not equivalent to cognitive networks of conceptual associations.
Some pioneering approaches (Stanghellini et al. 2023) are entwining the structures of cognitive and
psychometric networks, merging the semantic content of items in psychometric questionnaires with
numerical responses. Notice that Definition 1 does not include brain networks (Beaty et al. 2018),
which can be used to predict cognitive phenomena or traits (e.g. creativity levels) but encode
relationships between brain circuits rather than between cognitive representations of concepts.
2.1. Simple mathematical definitions: Edges, vertices and sets
When considering only a single type of conceptual association (Siew et al. 2019; Stella 2022),
cognitive networks can be represented as a couple of sets (𝑉, 𝐸), which includes a vertex set 𝑉 =
{𝑖, … , 𝑠, … , 𝑗} (consisting of the concepts) and an edge set E, e.g. {(𝑖, 𝑗), … (𝑠, 𝑖)} (consisting of the
links between concepts). In undirected conceptual associations, the relationship between two words,
represented as the link (i, j), is symmetrical, meaning it is equivalent to the reverse order (j, i). This
symmetry is denoted as i-j, indicating that the connection between the two words is bidirectional. For
example, considering the synonyms “land” and “earth”, the undirected link “land”-“earth” conveys
that both terms are conceptually related with no directionality or hierarchy between them.
Importantly, in undirected links, the order in which words are connected is irrelevant, emphasising
the mutual and interchangeable nature of these types of associations.
Instead, in directed associations the order of words is relevant (Stella et al. 2018). For instance, in
the sentence “birds are a broader category of doves”, the fact that “bird” is a hypernym of “dove”
could be coded as a directed connection 𝑏𝑖𝑟𝑑 → 𝑑𝑜𝑣𝑒. Specifically, this coding signifies that “bird”
is a broader category encompassing the more specific term “dove”. The directional arrow (→)
captures the hierarchical flow, from the hypernym “bird” to the hyponym “dove”. This emphasises
the directional relationship between these two words. Such a connection could be represented as a
couple of elements in case of considering the order, i.e. the source node will appear first in the list,
followed by the target node. Hence, 𝑏𝑖𝑟𝑑 → 𝑑𝑜𝑣𝑒 could be represented as (𝑏𝑖𝑟𝑑, 𝑑𝑜𝑣𝑒). Instead,
(𝑑𝑜𝑣𝑒, 𝑏𝑖𝑟𝑑) or, equivalently, 𝑑𝑜𝑣𝑒 → 𝑏𝑖𝑟𝑑, would not encode a hypernym but rather a hyponym.
Networks where all links are undirected are called undirected networks (Newman 2018). Networks
with only directed links are called directed networks. Networks combining directed and undirected
connections can be recast as special cases of directed networks in case undirected connections are
split in reciprocated directed connections, for instance the relationship “good”-“positive” could be
undirected cognitive network, with a vertex set 𝑉 = {𝑐𝑎𝑡, 𝑐𝑎𝑛, 𝑐𝑎𝑏, 𝑚𝑎𝑛, 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑏}. The links between
the entries map phonological similarities between their transcriptions. Such phonological similarities
regard words differing by the addition, substitutions or deletion of one phoneme (Vitevitch 2008).

slight phonological modifications can result in a series of words with interconnected phonological
similarities, i.e. sounding similar with each other.
represented as 𝐸 = {(𝑐𝑎𝑡, 𝑐𝑎𝑏), (𝑐𝑎𝑛, 𝑐𝑎𝑏), (𝑐𝑎𝑛, 𝑐𝑎𝑡), (𝑚𝑎𝑛, 𝑐𝑎𝑛), (𝑐𝑎𝑏, 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑏)}, indicating the
relationships among the words in terms of phonological similarities (Turnbull 2021). What is reported

words in the IPA alphabet (see also Turnbull 2021). The links between transcriptions indicate
phonological similarities (i.e. two words differing for the addition, substitution or deletion of one
phoneme only and thus sounding similar to each other).
2.2. Single-layer, multilayer and multiplex lexical networks
Extensive psycholinguistic research has shown that among the very same set of concepts there can
be multiple types of conceptual associations (Fay & and Cutler 1977; Aitchison 2012; Abrams &
Davis 2016). In other words, the concepts can relate to one another in multiple ways. For instance,
“cat”, “dog” and “wolf” in terms of them belonging to the category of animals. A single-layer network
can contain these relationships, although it may lack a broader picture of the various other
relationships connecting these words on other levels. The same set of words can also be related in
terms of semantic overlap, as in “dog” overlapping semantically with “wolf”, i.e. sharing certain
characteristics. Furthermore, considering the phonological level “cat” would be related to “mat” due
to their phonological similarity (see Fig. 2, right).
containing only relationships through free association on a single network layer. Left: Multilayer
language network capturing how distinct semantic features and phonemes are mapped onto a set of
words. Each layer contains a different set of nodes. Right: Multiplex lexical network featuring
associative, semantic and phonological relationships. Each layer contains the same set of nodes,
indicating different relationships between them.
Since single-layer networks capture only one type of relationship, this limits the analysis to a single
dimension of connectivity (Newman 2018). However, multiple types of relationships being present
among the same set of concepts calls for networks with multiple layers to adequately represent the
depicts two possible network types featuring multiple layers: multilayer networks (left) and multiplex
networks (right).
Multilayer networks are highly flexible, allowing each layer to contain different sets of nodes and
interactions (Newman 2018). This makes multilayer networks well-suited for systems where not all
entities are involved in every type of relationship (Kivelä et al. 2014). For example, in a language
dog → is alive), while another layer represents the phonemes the phonological form of the word
consists of (e.g. dog → /d/, /o/, /g/). Not all phonemes or semantic features map exactly onto all
words, thereby creating layers with potentially differing numbers of nodes and interactions (Stella et
al. 2024).
In contrast, multiplex networks are a specific subtype of multilayer networks where the same set
of nodes exist across all layers. Each set of concepts is mapped exactly onto the next layer, with each
layer representing a distinct type of interaction among the same entities (Stella et al. 2017; Stella et
al. 2018; Stella 2020b). This structure is especially useful when studying how different types of
a multiplex lexical network could represent the same set of words (e.g. “mat”, “cat”, “dog”, “wolf”)
and capture a different dimension of connectivity among them, such as free associations, semantic
overlap or phonological similarities, among many other types. In general, in a multiplex lexical
network, multiple edge-lists 𝐸 , … , 𝐸 co-exist, each one composing a distinct network layer with the
1 𝐿
same set of nodes (Stella et al. 2024).
Historically, the idea of different layers originated in social science contexts for mapping different
types of social relationships among the same set of individuals (Newman 2018). In cognitive science,
instead, relationships of different colours indicate different aspects of associative knowledge being
simultaneously or sequentially used for acquiring, storing, and processing concepts (Hills et al. 2009;
Citraro et al. 2023). For instance, the phenomenon of malapropism (Fay & Cutler 1977) occurs when
someone can access the phonological information relative to a given target word but then fails at
activating the correct semantic information that would lead to using the target word in the correct
context. An example of malapropism could be “I band but I don´t break” where we use “band” instead
of “bend”. The occurrence of malapropism in common language signifies that phonological and
semantic layers are distinct but interact with each other during language processing and production
(see also Doczi 2019). This importance is further underlined by another phenomenon rising from the
interactions between semantic and phonological aspects of the mental lexicon, i.e. the so-called “tip
of the tongue” event (Abrams & Davis 2016). This takes place when someone can access the semantic
features of a given target word but is unable to retrieve and produce the phonological instruction for
naming the target. For instance, someone might be familiar with the concept of a crane (e.g. being a
bird, having wings, flying) but ultimately being unable to say the name at the moment and rather use
a common English expression: “I have it on the tip of my tongue.” Malapropisms and tip-of-the-
tongue events both underline how important it is to identify models that can encapsulate at the same
time semantic and phonological relationships between concepts, like multiplex lexical networks.
Multiplex networks can exist with (Fig. 3, right) or without (Fig. 3, left) explicit links between
different layers. Some multiplex networks include explicit links between layers to model
social networks, users may have accounts on multiple platforms (e.g. Instagram, Facebook) and
interlayer links can represent the association of accounts belonging to the same user (Khdir et al.
2024). In contrast, in many multiplex networks, once one identifies all the replicas of the same entity
(e.g. all the replicas of “mat” across layers) there is no need to further specify direct unweighted links
separate visually distinct layers and drawing connections between them (see Fig. 3, right), this visual
representation without explicit interlayer links collapses all layers together onto one level. The
different types of relations between nodes as based on a different layer are indicated by links being
drawn in different colours (see Fig. 3, left). Therefore, multiplex networks without explicit interlayer
links are also called “edge-coloured” graphs (Stella et al. 2017; De Domenico 2022). The left panel

(cyan) associations. These networks can be visualised by either emphasising their multi-layer
structure (right, multiplex representation), where all nodes are replicated across layers, or by
collapsing layers together while preserving different colours (left, edge-coloured representation). The
largest connected component of the network is highlighted in yellow.
In cognitive networks, modelling interactive or subsequent transitions between phonology and
semantics poses a challenge. As a result, most multiplex lexical networks in the current literature are
presented as edge-coloured graphs (see Fig. 3). In these edge-coloured graphs, different types of
the semantic layer is portrayed in cyan while the phonological layer is depicted in red. This coding
via colours allows for a clear visual distinction between the various types of associations within the
multiplex network (Stella et al. 2017; Stella et al. 2018).
An alternative approach to visualising multilayer networks is through feature-rich graphs (Citraro
et al. 2023b), which allow for the integration of multiple attributes into a single representation. These
graphs not only capture the connections between elements (e.g. words) but also information about
an exemplary network constructed for the Woseco (Word-sentence-construction) task. In this task,
participants create a chain of sentences that are linked to each other through a shared word repeated
in both sentences (Haim et al. 2024). For example, a Woseco text could go: “In school we learn about
based on their sequence within the sentences, with edges reflecting the syntactic relationships
between them. The nodes are colour-coded to indicate their grammatical properties such as word
category (nouns are blue, verbs are orange and adjectives are pink). This feature-rich design of a
Woseco network highlights both the structural and grammatical aspects of the network.
Example Woseco sentences:
In school we learn about chemistry.
In chemistry I love the experiments.
During the experiments we are careful.
If you are not careful, the chemicals explode.
Chemicals can explode or start boiling.
You shouldn't boil things without a lab coat.
My lab coat is stained.
repeated across the chain of sentences. The edges represent the syntactic relationships between the
words within the text. Nodes are colour-coded to indicate their word category. Nouns are depicted in
blue, verbs in orange and adjectives in pink.
Why use multiplex rather than simpler single-layer networks? The combination of network layers
might highlight phenomena that could not be observed in individual networks. For instance, in (Siew
& Vitevitch 2019) orthographic and phonological similarities highlighted facilitative effects in visual
word recognition that were not observed in orthographic similarities or phonological similarities
separately. Other examples include phenomena such as enhanced preferential acquisition (Stella et
al. 2017) and improved lexical processing based on word distance in clinical populations (Castro &
Stella 2019; Castro et al. 2020; Baker et al. 2023). These phenomena emerged only when semantic
and phonological layers were combined in the multiplex structure: Multiplexity might open up novel
perspectives when modelling semantic memory. For a more comprehensive review on the topic, we
refer to Stella et al. (2022).
Edge-coloured graphs and multiplex lexical networks (Stella et al. 2018) can be used as synonyms
whenever there are no explicit costs for transitioning between layers. Explicit costs for transitioning
between layers could entail the effort, resources or time required to navigate across these layers. For
instance, in a cognitive network, moving from a semantic layer, containing conceptual information,
to a phonological layer, representing the sound form of a word, may involve overcoming activation
thresholds or activation costs (Siew & Vitevitch 2019; Stella et al. 2024). Consider spreading
activation in this context. When a word is activated (e.g. the word is read on a screen) its associated
activation spreads to its neighbouring nodes and through the network. The spreading activation
diminishes over distance and with each node it traverses (Collins & Loftus 1975; Koponen 2021).
Similarly, inter-layer transitions may also encounter diminishing activation energy or increased
cognitive load, representing certain costs for traversing from one layer to the next. These costs may
be higher for weak or distant connections and lower for strong connections between layers. For
example, a weak semantic-phonological coupling for an infrequent word might lead to difficulty in
word retrieval, whereas stronger links could make transitioning more efficient (Koponen 2021; Siew
2019).
In cases where there are no explicit costs associated with transitions between layers, the
connections may be highly efficient or seamlessly integrated, facilitating a free flow of activation
without significant energy loss, delays or cognitive effort. For instance, a strong coupling of the
semantic and phonological layers for highly frequent words might result in spreading activation from
the conceptual representation (e.g. a concept is shown as a picture and shall be named) to its
phonological form without significant costs. This scenario could occur when inter-layer links are
strong or tasks are highly automated, such as in fluent speech or reading, though empirical validation
of such cases remains limited (Stella et al. 2018; Koponen 2021).
2.3. Simple mathematical definitions: Adjacency matrices
Both single- and multiplex networks can be represented as matrices (Newman 2018; De Domenico
2022). An adjacency matrix 𝑆 encodes the connectivity of any single-layer network in its elements,
e.g. 𝑠 where each element represents the presence (1) or absence (0) of a connection between nodes
𝑖𝑗
i and j. If there is a link between i and j then 𝑠 = 1, otherwise 𝑠 = 0 (see Fig. 5). This also means
𝑖𝑗 𝑖𝑗
that the dimensionality of 𝑆 is 𝑁 × 𝑁, where 𝑁 = |𝑉| is the number of nodes in the network. In
undirected networks, 𝑆 must be symmetric, i.e. 𝑠 = 𝑠 ∀𝑖, 𝑗 ∈ 𝑉. 𝑆 encapsulates the so-called
𝑖𝑗 𝑗𝑖
“topology” of a network, specifying how links are organised between nodes. Elements 𝑠 , when
𝑖𝑖
present, are called self-loops. An undirected, unweighted network without self-loops is also called a
network with its respective adjacency matrix.
A B C D
A 0 1 1 0
B 1 0 1 0
C 1 1 0 1
D 0 0 1 0
matrix (right). The existence or absence of connections between the entries A, B, C and D is indicated
in the adjacency matrix as either 1 (link exists) or 0 (no link exists).
Weighted networks extend this representation by including a weight matrix 𝑊 where each element
𝑤 represents the strength of the connection between i and j. For example, in a semantic network,
𝑖𝑗
𝑤 might represent the frequency with which words i and j co-occur with each other in a text,
𝑖𝑗
indicating their associative relationship. In phonological networks, weights can encode the degree of
phonetic similarity between words, highlighting how closely related they are in their sound form
(Castro & Siew 2020). Alternatively, weights might indicate the co-occurrence of words in fluency
experiment tasks coded as semantic networks (Kenett et al. 2018).
Weights also allow researchers to capture asymmetries or varying intensities within cognitive
systems. For instance, two words such as “degree” and “freedom” might co-occur frequently in a
context of statistics (as in “degrees of freedom”) but rarely in another more general context, resulting
in different weights for their connections in different subsets. Weighted networks allow the
identification of hubs with disproportionately strong connections. In contrast, simple unweighted
networks (see Fig. 5) treat all connections equally, which may hide meaningful variations in the
occurrences with its respective adjacency matrix. In case of bigger weight, the strength of the
connection between two nodes is indicated through thicker links and nodes with higher weight are
depicted larger.
A B C D
A 0 2 5 0
B 2 0 3 0
C 5 3 0 1
D 0 0 1 0
(right). The strength of connections between the entries A, B, C and D is reflected in the adjacency
matrix with higher numbers indicating greater weight of the link.
2.4. Simple mathematical definitions: Degree, power-laws, hubs and degree distributions
In simple networks, summing over the 𝑖-th column or row of matrix 𝑆 provides the total number
of links featuring node 𝑖. This total is known as the network degree 𝑘 . The network degree 𝑘 is a
𝑖 𝑖
local network measure specific to node i: Degree counts only interactions that directly consider one
node while neglecting the rest. In phonological networks, network degree has long been called
phonological neighbourhood density (PND), counting words which are phonologically similar to a
given target (Vitevitch 2008; Turnbull 2021). Degree/PND has been shown to influence lexical
identification in confusability tasks and even short-term retainment (cf. Vitevitch & Mullin 2021).
For example, consider a node in a semantic network with a high degree, meaning it is connected to
numerous other nodes. In a confusability task, i.e. say whether a sequence of phonemes represents a
real word, participants might find it challenging to quickly and accurately identify this node due to
the abundance of interconnected associations, leading to potential confusion with closely related
concepts. Conversely, in short-term retention tasks, e.g. memorise and reproduce words, a node/word
with a high degree may be recalled more easily, as its rich connectivity aids in creating a robust and
interconnected mental representation, facilitating easier retrieval from memory according to a
spreading activation phenomenon (Vitevitch & Mullin 2021).
Much attention has been devoted to characterising a network based on the statistical distribution
of its degrees (see also Steyvers & Tenenbaum 2005). Consider the probability 𝑝(𝐾 = 𝑘) of
sampling one node in a network and finding it has a degree equal to 𝑘. Sampling means considering
one node at random by picking it among all available nodes in a given network structure. Thus, 𝑝(𝐾 =
𝑘) is the fraction of nodes with that degree. If the probability distribution of finding a node with a
specific degree follows a power-law distribution, then the network is said to be a power-law one. This
−𝛼
power-law distribution can be noted as 𝑝(𝐾 = 𝑘) = 𝑧 ⋅ 𝑘 where z is a normalisation factor and
𝛼 a power-law exponent. In cognitive networks, a power-law distribution might manifest as the
majority of concepts having a low degree of semantic connections, while a few concepts gather a vast
amount of connections or associations. Fitting a power-law distribution directly to 𝑝(𝐾 = 𝑘) suffers
from high error margins over nodes with infrequently high degrees (cf. Alstott et al. 2014). This issue
can be reduced if one considers the cumulative degree distribution 𝐶(𝐾 ≥ 𝑘), i.e. the probability of
finding a node with a degree equal to or higher than 𝑘. Notice, however, that fitting a specific equation
to an empirical degree distribution can be daunting not only in statistical terms but also for the
interpretation of degree distributions. Power-law degree distributions are interesting mostly because
they indicate the presence of a few hub nodes, i.e. nodes with high degrees, thanks to their heavy-
tailed decay. The “tails” of a distribution refer to the extreme ends of the distribution, where the
probability of observing values becomes progressively smaller. A distribution can have a “heavy tail”
if the probability of extreme events, located in a tail, decreases more slowly than it would in a normal
or exponential distribution. This implies that rare and high-magnitude events, e.g. hubs, occur more
frequently than expected in heavy-tailed rather than non-heavy-tailed distributions (e.g. Gaussian
distributions). Hence power-law degree distributions in networks imply that a few nodes have
exceptionally high degrees (Champagnat et al. 2013). However, this can be the case also in presence
of other heavy-tailed distributions, e.g. log-Gaussian distributions or stretched exponentials. Since
from a cognitive perspective it remains unclear whether cognitive representations have a specific
benefit in displaying power-law degree distributions, the emphasis should be put not on detecting
power-lawness but rather in identifying hubs. For large values of 𝑘, the probability of finding a node
with a high degree, i.e. a hub, can be considerably higher for a heavy-tailed than for an exponential
distribution with the same average degree 〈𝑘〉. For example, in a semantic network with a heavy-tailed
degree distribution, a small number of concepts - yet higher than in random graphs with exponential
degree distributions - may serve as prominent hubs, forming numerous connections, while the
majority of concepts have fewer connections (De Arruda et al. 2017; Newman 2018).
In semantic networks, hubs often represent pivotal concepts that play significant roles in
information flow and cognitive processing (Stella 2020b). These hubs may correspond to central ideas
or key semantic components that hold considerable influence over the overall network structure (De
Arruda et al. 2017). A commonly used non-parametric definition identifies hubs as nodes falling in
th
the upper percentiles of the degree distribution, e.g. nodes with degrees in the 95 percentile of
𝑝(𝐾 = 𝑘) (cf. Stella 2020b and De Domenico 2022). By identifying and understanding these hubs,
cognitive network scientists can gain insights into the organisational principles of cognitive networks,
discerning the key nodes that shape information flow and contribute substantially to cognitive
processes. For instance, hubs might be general-level cues that mediate memory recollections of many
other concepts (De Deyne et al. 2013). It was recently shown that hubs tend to be acquired earlier by
normative English-speaking toddlers, i.e. children who follow typical language development
timelines (Hills et al. 2009; Sizemore et al. 2018). In contrast the acquisition of semantic hubs is
impaired in late learners (Beckage et al. 2011). Late learners are children who develop language skills
more slowly than the majority of children, i.e. normatively developing children, due to environmental
or social factors (e.g. reduced language exposure) rather than any clinical or neurological issues
(Beckage et al. 2011). A normative English-speaking toddler might readily acquire a semantic hub
such as “apple” due to its common use and broad applicability in everyday contexts. In contrast, a
late learner might struggle to acquire such foundational concepts, leading to difficulties in
comprehending fundamental terms that serve as central nodes in their cognitive network which further
interferes negatively with their ability to learn and connect other words in their semantic network
(Beckage et al. 2011; Hills et al. 2009; Sizemore et al. 2018).
2.5. A bit less simple mathematical definitions: Network Laplacians and spreading activation
For any single-layer simple network, let us consider a degree matrix 𝐷 which indicates the degree
of a node on its main diagonal and 0s everywhere else. Let us also consider the adjacency matrix 𝑆
of this network which represents the actual connections a node has, indicated by 1 for existing edges
and 0 if there is no edge between a given pair of nodes. Through 𝑆 and 𝐷 we can define a network
Laplacian as 𝐿 = 𝐷 − 𝑆 (cf. Koponen 2021). A Laplacian matrix encodes how each node in the
network is connected to other nodes and provides a mathematical way of representing how activation
can spread across a network. When a node is activated, the activation spreads through the edges and
visual representation of a simple network consisting of four nodes and their respective degree matrix,
adjacency matrix and Laplacian matrix.
Degree Matrix Adjacency Matrix Laplacian Matrix
A B C D A B C D A B C D
A 2 0 0 0 A 0 1 1 0 A 2 -1 -1 0
B 0 2 0 0 B 1 0 1 0 B -1 2 -1 0
C 0 0 3 0 C 1 1 0 1 C -1 -1 3 -1
D 0 0 0 1 D 0 0 1 0 D 0 0 -1 1
matrix. The degree matrix captures the degree of each node on the main diagonal. The adjacency
matrix highlights which nodes are connected with 1 if there is an edge between two nodes and 0 if
there is no edge. The Laplacian matrix is calculated by subtracting the adjacency matrix from the
degree matrix, indicating how easily the activation in the network can spread.
Let us discuss diffusive processes through a physical metaphor. Imagine a liquid with droplets
main diagonal of 𝐿 comes from 𝐷 (for simple networks) and it encodes information over the total
flow that can accumulate across links surrounding each node, e.g. one droplet per link. However, 𝐿
contains also entries from the adjacency matrix 𝑆 so each off-diagonal entry in 𝐿 indicates where
droplets can arrive into or leave nodes when flowing through connections. Overall, it is expected that
𝐿 regulates the diffusion of droplets across links and over nodes in a given network (Newman 2018).
The Laplacian 𝐿 is also relevant to cognitive scientists modelling spreading activation in lexical
retrieval (Siew 2019). Spreading activation was introduced by Collins and Loftus to model semantic
priming (Collins & Loftus 1975). A prime/node 𝑖 receives an initial activation level 𝑎 (0). At the
next time step, the activation 𝑎 (0) spreads uniformly across the 𝑘 links of 𝑖 to its neighbours. When
𝑖 𝑖
the activation spreads, at each time step the activation level from a given node - or part of it - is
transmitted to its connected neighbours, influencing their subsequent activation levels. The signal can
receive dampening or spread integrally based on factors such as the strength of connections between
nodes. For instance, when flowing along connections, a part of the activation signal might get lost
(uniform dampening). It might also be that some conceptual associations might be weaker and thus
receive lower activation units, whereas other associations might be stronger and thus able to channel
stronger activation signals (Collins and Loftus considered this latter case as “highways” able to
withstand higher traffic loads, see Collins & Loftus 1975). Iteratively, the activation signals of all
nodes with some activation levels have to spread across neighbours. The process continues iteratively
until a final time step is reached, typically when the system achieves a stable state or a desired number
of iterations have been reached (Collins & Loftus 1975; Castro & Siew 2020). Simulated activation
levels on phonological networks were shown to replicate key findings in lexical processing (Vitevitch
& Mullin 2021), indicating a crucial link between this model and some instances of knowledge
processing in the mental lexicon.
For an example of spreading activation, consider activating the word “dove” in the semantic
over successive timesteps with each timestep represented by a distinct colour. At the first timestep
(indicated by blue edges), activation flows from node A (“dove”) to nodes B and C (“bird” and “fly”).
For this example, we assume that each node retains 50% of its activation and distributes the remaining
50% evenly to its neighbours. This results in “bird” and “fly” receiving 25% of the initial activation.
At the next timestep the activation gets spread on further, for instance from “bird” to “fly”,
contributing to an additional 12.5% of activation to node C. The strength of activation spreading is
noted on the edges while the total activation received by each node is displayed at the node and
marked in yellow. This highlights how activation spreads and accumulates across timesteps.
Laplacian Matrix

D 0 0 -1 1
the activation they receive and spread the remaining 50% equally to their neighbouring nodes. The
strength of this spread of activation is noted next to the edges. The total activation received by a node
is marked in yellow next to the node.
The Laplacian matrix helps to track how activation levels ripple through the network and how
much activation remains after it has spread throughout the network. The off-diagonal elements in the
Laplacian matrix (highlighted in yellow) show the direct connections between nodes with negative
values indicating the strength of potential activation flow. The diagonal elements (marked in pink)
represent the node degrees and quantify the capacity of each node to spread activation to its
neighbours. Nodes with higher degree possess greater potential to spread activation and have more
influence on the overall activation dynamics within the network. For example, consider node A in
𝐴𝐴
weights of -1 for the connections to B and C (off-diagonal entries 𝐿 and 𝐿 ). When node A is
𝐴𝐵 𝐴𝐶
activated, its energy is distributed proportionally to these links, meaning that activation flows equally
to nodes B and C.
Importantly, network structure can influence the amount of activation a target node can receive,
thus influencing its cognitive processing. Clustering, degree and distance (see down below) can
promote the concentration of activation over nodes related to the prime and thus suggest potential
candidates for recollection (Siew 2019; Kumar et al. 2021). In cognitive networks representing the
associative knowledge of students in the history of science, an appropriately normalised Laplacian
was shown to capture nodes representing prominent scientists (Koponen 2021).
2.6. Generalisations to multiplex lexical networks
The above notions can all be extended to multilayer networks. In the case of this tutorial paper let
us focus on the simpler instance of multiplex networks (Battiston et al. 2017). A supra-adjacency
matrix and a supra-Laplacian matrix can be built as block matrices, with the diagonal elements being
set to the adjacency (Laplacian) of individual layers and off-diagonal elements being equal to
diagonal matrices expressing inter-layer relationships. An example of a supra-adjacency matrix for a
and three nodes. All nodes on the first layer are linked to their respective counterparts on the second
layer. Notice that B also has intra-layer links to A and C .
1 2 2
For more details we refer the interested reader to (De Domenico 2022). Applying multilayer or
multiplex Laplacians to cognitive networks remains a scarcely explored research direction.
Instead, extending the idea of degree to multiplex networks is relatively simpler. Summing degrees
across layers, the multidegree 𝑚 of node 𝑖 is defined as:
(𝛼)
𝑚 = ∑ 𝑘 ,
(𝛼)
where 𝑘 is the degree of node 𝑖 in layer 𝛼, e.g. the number of cognitive links of layer 𝛼 surrounding
layer multiplex network.
three nodes. Node B has a multidegree of 4 since it has one edge within layer 1 and three intra-layer
links to A , B and C .
2 2 2
In multiplex networks, 𝛼 can enumerate the different replicas of a node across each layer. These
multiple representations of a single node across different layers of the network are called replica
nodes. Each replica node represents the same entity (e.g. a word) but in different layers, such as
as “cat” in node A could have two replica nodes: one on the phonological layer (A ) representing its
sound structure as [kæt] and one on the semantic layer indicating its meaning as a small feline animal
(A ) (Battiston et al. 2017).
that, when considering cognitive links across different layers, that node is connected to four distinct
other nodes across all layers. The multidegree of a node might thus be different from the single-layer
th
degrees of the node’s replicas. Multidegree can be used to define multiplex hubs: Nodes in the 95
percentile of the multidegree distribution. Stella (2020b) showed that a multiplex network
representation of the mental lexicon with 16,000 English words over 4 semantic/phonological layers
relied heavily on multidegree hubs to preserve connectivity (and thus a chance for activation
spreading) among large portions of words. Removing these hubs made the network highly fragmented
and disconnected, which hindered activation spreading from reaching several network regions, thus
impairing word retrieval and comprehension.
In semantic multiplex lexical networks, multidegree is also called semantic richness, i.e. the
number of concepts syntactically or semantically related to a target node/concept (Aitchison 2012;
Stella 2020). Nodes with higher semantic richness correspond to more general concepts that may be
used together with several other concepts or appear in a wider range of contexts (Semeraro et al.
2024). These words tend to be involved in more syntactic links within the network, which supports
easier activation in a variety of linguistic contexts. Psychologically, this relates with the idea of
priming, where activation of a concept facilitates the retrieval of related concepts (Siew 2019; Siew
and Vitevitch 2019). Multidegree hubs can be especially effective during priming due to their high
degree of connectivity across multiple layers. Such multidegree hubs might not only receive priming
more easily because they are linked to a broad array of concepts across different layers, but they can
also serve as relevant prime activators. Multidegree hubs’ central role across multiple layers allows
them to quickly spread activation, facilitating the retrieval of related words. For instance, when a
multidegree hub like “cat” is activated, it can rapidly prime other related words in both the semantic
layer (e.g. “dog” or “pet”) and the phonological layer (e.g. “bat” or “hat”) (Siew 2019). The
investigation of these nodes in the framework of cognitive multiplex networks (Stella et al. 2024)
remains an open yet interesting research area at the time of writing this tutorial.
2.7. Beyond degree: Local clustering coefficient and global clustering coefficient
Whereas degree is a local feature of nodes, local clustering and closeness centrality, respectively,
capture meso-scale (intermediate-sized structures or patterns within the network) and global aspects
(overall structure and efficiency of information flow across the entire network) of network topology
(Siew et al. 2019).
Local clustering is a meso-scale measure in that it characterises a node based on links between its
neighbours. Let us denote with 𝜕 the neighbourhood of nodes adjacent to 𝑖 in a given network, i.e.
the set of nodes linked with 𝑖. The local clustering coefficient 𝐶 is a property of node 𝑖 counting the
ratio of pairs in 𝜕 that are connected with each other:
|{(𝑘, 𝑙) ∈ 𝐸 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑘, 𝑙 ∈ 𝜕 }|
𝐶 = .
|𝜕 |(|𝜕 | − 1)
𝑖 𝑖
In other words, the local clustering coefficient measures a tendency for a node’s neighbours to
be linked with each other. 𝐶 ranges between 0 (no neighbours are linked) and 1 (all neighbours are
linked) (Siew & Vitevitch 2019). Alternatively, 𝐶 measures how much the neighbourhood of 𝑖
“remark” has three neighbours that are all linked with each other, so 𝐶 = 1.
𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑘
High local clustering is associated with small-worldness, a network property that combines high
local clustering with short average path lengths between nodes (Newman 2018). In cognitive
networks, this small-world structure supports connectivity within clusters and rapid traversal across
the network, similar to mechanisms underlying associative processes and memory retrieval (Siew
2020). In psychological terms, the property of small-worldness reflects how efficiently information
can be retrieved and connected in the human mind, supporting rapid access to related concepts
(Newman 2018).
However, studies found that higher local clustering in phonological networks corresponded to
degraded lexical identification, exemplified by the increased difficulty participants faced in
accurately and swiftly recognizing and retrieving specific words during linguistic tasks (Chan &
Vitevitch 2009). This can be understood through the lens of lexical competition, where densely
clustered phonological representations lead to greater interference among similar words, slowing
down retrieval. Activation for a target word accumulates along nodes in the neighbourhood of node
i, in formulas 𝜕 , which makes it more difficult for 𝑖 to stand out. Thus, in a phonological network
with higher local clustering, participants were found to struggle to quickly distinguish between
similar-sounding words due to the increased interference and competition among closely
interconnected/clustered phonological representations (Chan & Vitevitch 2009; Castro & Siew 2020).
In multiplex networks 𝐶 cannot be generalised in a single way, depending on how links from
different layers are counted (De Domenico 2022). Siew and Vitevitch (2019) aggregated orthographic
and phonological similarities and found that a higher 𝐶 corresponded to a facilitatory effect over
spoken word recognition. In a multiplex network combining orthographic and phonological layers, a
higher 𝐶 value might indicate a more interconnected relationship between written and spoken
representations of words, leading to enhanced facilitation in recognizing and processing those words
in spoken form (Siew & Vitevitch 2019).
2.8. Connectedness, distance and closeness centrality in single-layer and multiplex networks
Network distance is the shortest number 𝑑 of links connecting any two nodes (cf. Steyvers &
𝑙𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟,𝑝ℎ𝑟𝑎𝑠𝑒
path of any finite, non-zero, length between 𝑖 and 𝑗 then the latter are said to be connected. In simple
networks, the largest set of connected nodes is also called the largest connected component (LCC).
In directed networks, one has to consider directionality for navigating the network structure from one
node to another. Two nodes might have a sequence of links between them (i.e. a path) but
directionality might impede getting out from one node to access another along the path. If this
happens, those nodes would be said to be weakly connected (Newman 2018). Otherwise, if
directionality would still provide access from one node to another along any given path, those nodes
would be said to be strongly connected (Newman 2018).
associations (i.e. two words were mentioned as cue and recall in a free association game). The shortest
path between “letter” and “phrase” is highlighted in red. Node size is proportional to their closeness
centrality.
In multiplex lexical networks, multiplex connectivity can exploit paths across all available layers
such as connections between phonological and semantic layers within the same multiplex network
(Stella et al. 2018). Consequently, multiplexity provides more shortcuts or opportunities for
connecting any two nodes. Furthermore, replica nodes disconnected in one layer might be connected
on another layer and thus, potentially, on the whole multiplex network too (see Fig. 10).
Cognitive network distance proves effective in capturing semantic relatedness and priming effects,
as demonstrated by Kenett et al. (2017), Kumar et al. (2020), and Wulff et al. (2022). Kenett and
colleagues (2017) found that in Hebrew, network distance in a free association network (where links
indicate memory recall patterns) outperformed advanced models like latent semantic analysis when
predicting data from a semantic relatedness judgement task. Kumar and colleagues (2020) replicated
these findings in English and expanded the exploration of semantic distances to predict reaction times
in priming tasks. They observed a linear increase in response latencies with network distance,
revealing significant differences between prime-target cases 𝑑 = 1 and 𝑑 = 4. For reviews on
𝑝𝑡 𝑝𝑡
this topic see (Kumar 2021; Wulff et al. 2022).
Notably, network distance has also illuminated variations in sequential lexical retrieval across
different populations, including those with distinct traits such as task-quantified creativity levels
(Stella & Kenett 2019). Assessments like the verbal fluency task serve as valuable tools for exploring
creativity and its relation to semantic networks (see also Section 3.2). In a verbal fluency task
individuals are asked to generate words within specific constraints, e.g. naming as many animals as
possible in two minutes (animal fluency task) (Goñi et al. 2011). Fluency tasks can be used in various
forms, such as semantic fluency, where participants need to generate words belonging to a certain
semantic category, or phonological fluency with the restriction that words need to begin with a
particular letter. In semantic fluency tasks, individuals with higher creativity levels were found to
produce recalls separated by longer network distances, on a multiplex network including almost 16k
English words, compared to controls with lower creativity levels (Stella & Kenett 2019).
Whereas distance is a network property considering two nodes at a time, one could be interested
also in assessing whether a single node is distant or close to all other nodes in a given connected
component. In simple networks, this can be done by considering closeness centrality (Newman 2018).
If 𝑖 belongs to a connected component with 𝑁 nodes, then the closeness of 𝑖 is defined as:
1 𝑁 − 1
𝑐 = = ,
〈𝑑 〉
∑ 𝑑
𝑖𝑗
𝑗 𝑖𝑗
where the normalisation 𝑁 − 1 factor excludes contributions from self-loops with 𝑑 = 0.
𝑖𝑖
Closeness centrality is a global network feature because it considers the whole layout of
shortest paths between a node and its whole connected component. A shorter average network
distance is supposed to be advantageous for mental navigation because it allows for quicker and more
efficient access to information, facilitating faster information retrieval and processing (Hills et al.
2012; Dubossarsky et al. 2017; Stella et al. 2018; Levy et al. 2021). In phonological networks, higher
closeness centrality of words is associated with quicker reaction times in an auditory lexical decision
task. In this task, participants must quickly determine whether a presented string of letters forms a
real word or a non-word. A quicker reaction time during this task highlights a beneficial role of shorter
network distance, thus higher closeness, for facilitating faster lexical decision making (Goldstein &
Vitevitch 2017).
In multiplex lexical networks, where there is no explicit cost for transitioning from one layer
to another, network distance is defined as the shortest path length connecting any two nodes through
links of any layer/colour (Stella et al. 2018). For instance, if “cat” and “crab” are connected by a
direct link in the semantic layer (since both are animals) and another direct link in the phonological
layer (due to their phonological similarity), the network distance between “cat” and “crab” is
considered as 1, regardless of the layers involved in the connection. Castro and Stella (2019) showed
how higher multiplex closeness centrality predicted better performance in picture naming by people
with aphasia disorders. As already mentioned above, multiplexity can provide additional shortcuts,
lowering down the distance between words (Quispe et al. 2021). Levy and colleagues showed that
the links provided by a phonological network present substantially more shortcuts to free association
networks than random expectation, thus, enhanced cognitive advantage over word processing from
combining free associations and phonological similarities (Levy et al. 2021). Words with higher
multiplex closeness centrality were found to be learned earlier by normative learning toddlers (Stella
et al. 2017). This latter finding is in agreement with the preferential acquisition hypothesis in
cognitive psychology (Hills et al. 2009; Sizemore et al. 2018; Borovsky et al. 2021; Cox & Haebig
2022). The preferential acquisition hypothesis states that children exhibit a tendency to preferentially
acquire information that is more central and well-connected in their environment (cf. Cox & Haebig
2022). Essentially, the preferential acquisition hypothesis suggests that the ease of access and
interconnectedness of a concept within one's cognitive structure both positively influence the
likelihood of that concept being learned earlier in the developmental process (Hills et al. 2009). In
this framework, high multiplex closeness centrality was shown to support early learning by making
words more accessible within the whole multiplex network compared to individual layers (Stella et
al. 2017). These empirical findings align with the tendency of children to acquire centrally connected
concepts earlier (Cox & Haebig 2022; Hills et al. 2009).
2.9. Beyond pairwise networks: Hypergraphs as cognitive models
Hypergraphs extend the concept of traditional networks by allowing edges (called hyperedges) to
connect more than two nodes simultaneously. Cognitive hypergraphs (introduced in Citraro et al.
2023; Citraro et al. 2023c) exploit a richer, more powerful mathematical representation compared to
pairwise cognitive networks. In mathematical terms, an undirected hypergraph H is denoted as 𝐻 =
(𝑉, 𝐸) with V being a set of nodes or vertices and E being a set of hyperedges. Each hyperedge is a
nonempty subset of V. A normal graph with edges containing exactly two nodes is called a 2-
hypergraph (Bretto 2013). In k-regular hypergraphs, all hyperedges link exactly k different nodes. If
k is not mentioned, then a hypergraph can feature hyperedges linking a variable number of nodes. For
example, if 𝑘 = 3 every hyperedge would link three distinct nodes (Bretto 2013).
Hypergraphs are especially valuable in cognitive network science when dealing with situations
where relationships naturally involve more than two entities. Consider free association tasks, where
a cue word elicits multiple related responses. In these tasks, an individual reads a cue and then recalls
at most three responses related to it (De Deyne et al. 2013). Mathematically, for a cue 𝑐 and its
responses 𝑟 , 𝑟 and 𝑟 the hyperedge between them can be represented as 𝑒 = {𝑐, 𝑟 , 𝑟 , 𝑟 }. For
1 2 3 1 2 3
instance, when prompted with “complex” a participant might think of “system”, “emergent” and
“more”. The responses from the free association task can be linked to the cue word as a “normal”
graph with each response receiving its distinct edge (Fig. 12 left) or a 4-hypergraph with one
hyperedge connecting all four nodes e = {complex, system, emergent, more} (Fig. 12 right).
(left) and a 4-hypergraph (right). Left: The normal graph (pairwise network or 2-hypergraph) consists
of three edges connecting exactly two nodes each; i.e. the cue word with each response separately.
Right: The 4-hypergraph consists of one edge connecting all four nodes; i.e. the cue word with all
responses combined.
Representing this scenario as a pairwise network (or 2-hypergraph) where edges exist only
between the cue and individual nodes loses the information that all three responses were elicited
together. De Deyne and colleagues (2013) showed that building pairwise free association networks,
i.e. featuring only links between the cue and its three responses, led to structural network measures
that predicted a variety of lexical processing tasks better than alternative pairwise networks linking
the cue and all responses with each other or considering only a connection between the cue and the
first response.
hypergraph (Fig. 13, left) encodes each set of responses as a hyperedge, preserving the full contextual
grouping. In contrast, the pairwise network (Fig. 13, right) connects one two nodes at a time, resulting
in a loss of higher-order relational information.
relative to {{"dove", "bird"},{"bird","animal","fly","sky"},{"weather","sky","rain","sun"}}. Each
set of responses is coded as a hyperedge with the first entry representing the cue, followed by the
responses.
Revisiting free association data, Citraro and colleagues (2023; 2023b) introduced cognitive
hypergraphs as a new idea at the interface of psychology and data science. Cognitive hypergraphs,
where an hyperlink encapsulated both the cue and its responses, provided better models than pairwise
networks in predicting psycholinguistic features like concreteness, a psycholinguistic norm indicating
whether concepts are perceived as tangible or easy to picture (cf. Citraro et al. 2023) or predicting
normative early word learning across self-reported norms and empirical norms in toddlers (cf. Citraro
et al. 2023c). These findings underline that in some specific tasks relative to lexical acquisition and
access, considering weak relationships between targets can be insightful. Hypergraphs provide more
flexible tools for capturing conceptual relationships between more than two elements at a time and
the above pioneering results indicate cognitive hypergraphs as a promising direction for future
research in cognitive network science.
3. Datasets and software for building cognitive networks
Computational scientists interested in analysing cognitive networks should be aware of relevant
datasets tailored to specific research interests. This section reviews both historical and more recent
datasets, organised across different aspects of the mental lexicon. Python libraries like NetworkX
make it easy to import networks as edge lists, while providing a wide variety of pre-implemented
network measures. Notice that igraph works also in R and Mathematica. For R users, MuxViz is a
powerful tool for multiplex network analysis and visualisation (De Domenico 2022). SemNA is
another valuable R package that specialises in generating semantic networks out of verbal fluency
data (Christensen & Kenett 2021).
3.1. Datasets and software for phonological networks
Phonological networks map sound similarities between words (Vitevitch 2008). These similarities
can be identified through shared phonemes, rhyme patterns or similar phonetic features (Vitevitch &
Mullin 2021). Building phonological networks thus requires phonological transcriptions. A widely
used approach is to adopt the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and consider IPA transcriptions
as strings of characters with each character representing a phoneme (Turnbull 2021). This is advisable
due to potential problems with orthographic writing, where the same sequence of letters may represent
different sounds in different words for non-transparent languages (Aitchison 2012), e.g. the English
word “meet” differing from its IPA transcription /miːt/. IPA also contains characters not representing
phonemes directly but still encoding for the duration of other phonemes. Therefore, it is most common
to use phonetic word transcriptions for generating phonological networks (Vitevitch 2008), including
or excluding non-phoneme characters (Turnbull 2021). For “transparent languages”, where there is a
consistent mapping between phonemes and letters, phonological networks can be built out of
orthographic word transcriptions (Martinčić-Ipšić et al. 2016). The “transparency” of these languages
is constituted by these consistent rules for grapheme-phoneme mapping, e.g. learning that “ie” in
German is always pronounced /iː/. For non-transparent languages, like English, ad-hoc datasets are
required to build phonological networks. The command WordData[] in Mathematica contains
phonological transcriptions for over 35,000 English words. A more extensive resource is the IPA-
transcriptions for 23 languages in multiple formats (including tsv, JSON and csv). Data scientists
might also consider procedural pipelines, which read an orthographic input and apply sequences of
transformations to get phonological transcriptions. One of these pipelines is the Epitran project
(Mortensen et al. 2018), which comes as an easy-to-install Python library and supports over 90
languages.
As mentioned above, the local topology of words in a phonological network can correspond to
facilitative/inhibitive patterns in word retrieval, confusability or short-term retention (cf. Siew et al.
2019; Vitevitch & Mullin 2021). The R package spreadR simulates spreading activation over any
single-layer network structure, including phonological ones, to capture patterns of lexical retrieval
like false alarm rates and inhibited spoken word recognition (Siew 2019). The package can be loaded
via CRAN and gets as an input a network topology, the starting node, a retention rate (how much
activation should not spread across links at each timestep), a dampening factor, the initial activation
level and how many steps should be executed. The package can output the whole spreading dynamics,
i.e. sequences of activation levels across all timesteps for all nodes in the network. Extensively tested
in phonological and semantic networks, spreadR represents a practical tool for harnessing how
patterns of word recall or identification might emerge from the interplay of network structure and
spreading dynamics (cf. Siew 2019).
3.2. Datasets and software for semantic networks
Semantic networks codify meaning similarities or memory-based relationships between words
such as hierarchical relationships like “animal” and “mammal”, or associative links like “sun” and
“day” (Kenett et al. 2018; Wulff et al. 2019; Valba et al. 2021). Dictionaries historically represented
key data sources for building semantic networks (Miller 1995). However, Big Data and mega-studies
are quickly enriching the landscape of semantic data by providing vast automatic datasets (Steyvers
& Tenenbaum 2005; Kennington & Schlangen 2015; Kumar et al. 2020). For example, Big Data
about language from sources like social media have been used to track shifts in conceptual knowledge
in response to real-world events. Davis (2023) used Twitter data to study how the concept of COVID-
19 reshaped the meanings and relationships of related words in the semantic network, especially those
tied to social interactions or emotions like fear. Tweets were collected mentioning specific topics and
were investigated via a sliding window approach. This approach examines clusters of words within a
fixed range (e.g. a window of five words on either side of a target word) to identify which words
commonly appear in close proximity. By constructing semantic networks from this big language data,
Davis (2023) observed that the semantic network shifted in such a way that emotionally and socially
related words became more central in the network structure, acting as hubs for connecting diverse
clusters of related concepts. This reflects their pivotal role in organising concepts within the network,
mirroring their heightened importance in societal discourse during the pandemic (Davis 2023).
Similar analyses were performed by Semeraro and colleagues (2022) to identify keywords and shifts
in network structure from over 5K Italian news about COVID-19 vaccines and discussed on Twitter.
While studies on Big Data about language as discussed above provide valuable insights into how
the societal discourse around a topic can shift, in this tutorial paper we will instead focus on: (i)
dictionary-based data, and (ii) behavioural/psychological data.
For dictionary-based data, one of the largest corpora of semantic relationships is WordNet (Miller
1995), where words are organised according to sense and semantically related senses create synsets.
For instance, “duck.n.01” refers to the animal with n.01 referring to a noun, whereas “duck.v.01” is
a movement with v.01 referring to a verb. WordNet maps six semantic relationships:
1. Synonyms: Synonymous words that share an overlap in meaning in some contexts, e.g. “forest”
and “woods”;
2. Hypernyms: Hypernyms represent superordinate generalisations, i.e. a concept representing a
whole category of more specific concepts, like “bird” being a generalisation of “dove”;
3. Hyponyms: Hyponyms are specifications of broader categories, i.e. a concept being a specific
instance of another concept representing a broader category, like “apple” being a specification of
“fruit”.
4. Antonyms: Antonyms denote contraries, like “trust” and “distrust”.
5. Meronyms: Meronyms highlight a concept being a part of another, as seen in “wheel” being a
part and, thus, a meronym of “car”.
6. Holonyms: Holonyms refer to concepts that include other parts within them. For example, “car”
is a holonym for “engine”, “wheel” and “seat” since these parts are components of a car. Thus,
holonyms are the counterpart of meronyms with holonyms describing the whole concept (“car”)
and meronyms referring to a part of that whole (“wheel”).
In Python, WordNet 3.0 is available via the wordnet package in NLTK (the Natural Language
available in R and, natively, in Mathematica through the WordData[] command. Through the
packages, one can access synsets and use them as edge lists (Steyvers & Tenenbaum 2005).
A pioneering study by Sigman and Cecchi (2001) examined the graph structure of WordNet to
uncover how the English lexicon is globally organised. They found that WordNet behaves as a small-
world network, where a few highly connected hubs dominate the structure. These hubs often represent
abstract, polysemous terms (i.e. terms with multiple meanings such as “head” being used for a human
head, a letter head, or the head of a department). Polysemy plays a crucial role in compactly
organising the semantic network, facilitating efficient navigation through the network (Sigman &
Cecchi 2001).
Whereas dictionary-based data comes from lexical resources mostly curated by expert linguists,
behavioural/psychological data include different types of semantic data coming from experimental
setups. One type of data where semantic networks can be highly valuable tools is data on language
acquisition. Semantic networks can offer insights into vocabulary development and the structure of
lexical knowledge. They can reveal patterns in how words are learned, grouped and interconnected
by children acquiring a first language or adults learning a second or third language and can shed light
on delayed language development (Agustín-Llach 2023; Jimenez & Hills 2023; Stella et al. 2017).
Research into early language acquisition reveals that children tend to group words by associative,
categorical and phonological links, which facilitates robust word learning. Simulations of vocabulary
growth suggest that children have a tendency to acquire hubs earlier, a phenomenon known as
preferential acquisition and increasingly studied with the help of cognitive network science
(Borovsky & Peters 2019; Citraro et al. 2023c; Stella et al. 2017; Stevyers & Tenenbaum 2004).
The semantic networks of typically developing children are characterised by high connectivity,
clustering, and the presence of hub nodes. These structural characteristics support efficient navigation
through the network and retrieval of words (Borovsky & Peters 2019; Stella et al. 2017). In contrast,
late talkers (i.e. children with delayed language onset despite no other developmental delays or
cognitive impairments) exhibit less complex lexical networks, with fewer connections and reduced
clustering. These structural differences suggest difficulties in integrating new words into existing
semantic structures and, thus, in establishing robust associative links between words (Jimenez & Hills
2023).
Another type of semantic data where constructing semantic networks can be highly informative is
free association data. Free association data allow us to examine how individuals recall information in
relation to a specific task, with the resulting patterns of retrieval being coded as empirical data, i.e.
requiring an experiment to be obtained rather than coming from dictionaries (De Deyne et al. 2013;
Kenett et al. 2018; Wulff et al. 2022; Wulff et al. 2022b). Free associations can be enriched with
emotional data to obtain forma mentis networks, i.e. structural representations of how individuals or
groups emotionally perceive and associate ideas in their memory (Ciringione et al. 2024). Free
associations can also be used to identify individuals' perceptions of general topics (Aeschbach et al.
2024) or key target ideas, like maths anxiety (Ciringione et al. 2024).
As mentioned in Section 2.9, in the continued free association task a participant reads a cue (e.g.
“pen”) and has to react with up to three responses that come to their mind as quickly as possible (e.g.
“paper”, “writer”, “pencil”) (De Deyne et al. 2013; De Deyne et al. 2019). Free associations encode
memory recalls, which are mostly semantic (Stella et al. 2017) but also multidimensional (De Deyne
et al. 2019; Ciaglia et al. 2023): Free associations can come from phonological, orthographic, visual
and other types of similarities between words. Currently, the Small World of Words (SWOW) project
is the largest repository of free association data across 17 languages
Unlike traditional dictionaries or thesauri, SWOW utilises word associations to uncover the meanings
and centrality of words in the human mind. The SWOW project involves presenting participants with
words and prompting them to provide spontaneous associations, i.e. to perform the continued free
association task. SWOW represents a rich, large-scale dataset: Currently, SWOW counts over
700,000 links between 40,000 English words and it keeps growing (De Deyne et al. 2019). Free
associations powered a wide variety of applications in the last few years, including the interplay
between semantic memory and concepts related to beauty and wellbeing (Kenett et al. 2021), or
suicide ideation (Teixeira et al. 2021), or personality traits (Kenett et al. 2018). Free association
networks using SWOW enabled researchers in exploring also the intricacies of word relationships,
including complex dimensions like individual differences (Wulff et al. 2022), creativity levels (Stella
& Kenett 2019), mental well-being (Fatima et al. 2021) and cognitive processes across ageing
(Dubossarsky et al. 2017; Wulff et al. 2019; Wulff et al. 2022b). SWOW thus represents a promising
dataset for next-generation models of cognition and human behaviour.
Other notable mentions of free association datasets include the University of South Florida Free
Association norms - 70,000 links between 10,000 American English words/nodes (Nelson et al. 2004)
- and the Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus - 325,000 links between 23,000 British English
words/nodes (Wilson & Kiss 1988).
Behavioural semantic data can come also as fluency lists (Rastelli et al. 2022; Fatima et al. 2021;
Siew & Guru 2023), i.e. ordered sequences of words relative to a given category (as already
mentioned in Section 2.8). For instance, in a category task, individuals produce fluency lists of as
many words as possible from a given category within a time limit of 2 minutes (Goñi et al. 2011).
The number of responses measures the so-called linguistic fluency and it has been used historically
as a psychometric measurement of language skills (see also Zemla et al. 2020). However, fluency
lists should be seen as the outcome of mental search and retrieval processes of a highly complex
nature and potentially foraging/exploiting some network aspects of the mental lexicon (Hills & Kenett
2021). Cognitive networks built from fluency lists can go beyond simple fluency measures and unveil
the structure among consecutive responses. How to assess the cognitive network structure embedded
but not immediately apparent in fluency lists? There is no unique answer to this research question,
however most studies on the topic tend to follow mostly two psychometric approaches: (i) consider
fluency lists as ordered sequences of cognitive data where subsequent or co-occurring responses share
stronger semantic similarities than concepts further apart in the sequence, or (ii) consider fluency lists
as observed data coming from a latent cognitive network structure, which can be inferred via
mathematical modelling.
Historically, the first approach was the first one to appear in the literature (cf. Goñi et al. 2011),
inspired by word co-occurrences (Amancio 2015). Goñi and colleagues (2011) introduced a simple
yet elegant co-occurrence Binomial filtering for tracing which concepts tended to co-occur more than
randomly expected in sets of fluency lists (Goñi et al. 2011). Their approach was thus psychometric
in that they considered a null model and filtered against spurious co-occurrences. When conducting
the category fluency task on the topic “animals”, the resulting fluency networks were typically
characterised such that animals sharing several semantic features (such as appearance or habitat)
tended to be more tightly connected to each other than to other animals/nodes in the network.
Fluency data can also be considered as the outcome of random walks over latent cognitive
structures. Hence, making semantic networks based on fluency data can be considered the outcome
of an inference problem. This means that building such networks involves making mathematical
inferences based on the fact that the observed fluency data is the outcome of a stochastic/random
process, one observation among many possible ones. A tool that can be utilised for building fluency
Accessed: 04/12/23). SNAFU stands for Semantic Network and Fluency Utility and helps, among
other functions, with counting clusters, perseverations and calculating word frequency (Zemla et al.
2020). This reconstruction approach created cognitive networks whose features automatically
classified people affected by early Alzheimer’s Disease (against healthy controls) with an accuracy
of over 92% and an F1 score of 0.88 (Zemla & Austerweil 2019). These datasets and methodologies
all open the way to exciting data-informed explorations of mental search processes.
An intermediate (set of) approach(es) between network inference and co-occurrence analysis is
the recent SemNA package, which transforms fluency data in cognitive networks and provides
accessible tools for network analysis with a comprehensive point-and-click interface (Christensen &
Kenett 2021). This package incorporates several R modules, including SemNetDictionaries,
SemNetCleaner, and SemNeT. These modules play integral roles in preprocessing, data cleaning, and
semantic network generation. Notably, SemNA facilitates the generation of four distinct networks,
of example code in R for using the SemNA package. In a first step, the verbal fluency data is prepared
by using the textcleaner function for automatic spelling correction, identification and exclusion of
inappropriate words. Next, group data is divided in order to generate semantic networks and calculate
differences for each group, including statistical testing via t-tests and bootstrapping. Finally, the
SemNetShiny() command opens an easily accessible point-and-click interface where statistical and
graphical semantic network analyses are conducted.
package has an integrated module for preprocessing and cleaning raw fluency data. Dictionaries for
British and American English are available and can be extended with custom-made dictionaries (see
dictionary = “NAME OF DICTIONARY”). Lastly, by launching SemNetShiny(), one is forwarded to
an easily accessible point-and-click interface where semantic network analyses are conducted.
Recent studies used fluency networks (built in either ways) that can unveil crucial differences in
the way groups of individuals with different altered cognitive states (Rastelli et al. 2022), age
(Cosgrove et al. 2021), education levels (Denervaud et al. 2021) or domain knowledge proficiency
(Siew & Guru 2023) structured their semantic memories. These recent and intriguing results underline
how giving structure to fluency data can unveil interesting cognitive and psychological patterns.
3.3. Datasets and software for syntactic networks
Syntactic networks explicate grammatical and meaning relationships between words in sentences
(Ferrer i Cancho et al. 2004). For instance, “Love is weakness” syntactically specifies a property
(“weakness”) of a noun, “love”, through a verb. This sentence might thus be represented as the
undirected link (love, weakness). Extracting syntactic relationships is known as parsing. In the human
mind, this complex task involves a variety of complex phenomena taking place in sequences that are
partly unknown (cf. Doczi 2019) but include: breaking down sentences into their grammatical
components, identifying the relationships between words and understanding the overall meaning
conveyed by the arrangement of linguistic elements. In the context of syntactic analysis for research,
the task of parsing has long been left to human coding (Carley 1993), which refers to the manual
process of annotating and categorising linguistic elements and relationships between them within a
given text. The time-consuming process of human coding has been revolutionised with the advent of
soft computing models like the Stanford Universal Parser (Dozat et al. 2017) or spaCy’s library
automatic syntactic parsing via Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Before automatic syntactic parsing, word co-occurrences have been a computationally
advantageous proxy for extracting local syntactic relationships from text (Amancio 2015). Word-
word co-occurrences identify which words in sentences tend to appear as adjacent or separated by 𝑙
words. Co-occurrences can be discarded if below a threshold (Amancio 2015; Teixeira et al. 2021)
or filtered against random expectation (Quispe et al. 2021). For a pedagogic tutorial about how to
build word co-occurrence networks in Python, see the Semantic Brand Score Package
monitor brand perceptions online via co-occurrences in users’ reviews (Colladon 2018). Word co-
occurrences in adults’ child-directed speech contributed to predicting early word learning (Stella et
al. 2017) and differed in structure from adults’ general speech (Cox & Haebig 2022).
While more computationally costly, automatic syntactic parsing captures non-local syntactic
dependencies that would be lost with co-occurrences. Consider the sentence “Climate change is such
a terrible, disastrous, problematic issue” in which “change” and “issue” are syntactically related but
separated by three adjectives. Thus, co-occurrence networks with 𝑙 < 3 would miss this syntactic
relation due to the number of intervening specifications.
Capturing all syntactic relationships in a text means automating content mapping (Carley 1993)
and operationalising the automatic constructions of sets of words all referring to a given target word
x, i.e. the automatic construction of the semantic frame for x (Fillmore & Baker 2012). Both frame
semantics and content mapping are frameworks capturing stances, frames, mindsets or perceptions,
which in general terms all rely on specific ways of associating and combining ideas in communicative
intentions (Stella 2022). According to the theory of frame semantics (Fillmore & Baker 2012),
reconstructing the semantic frame of a word is enough to understand its meaning in a given text.
Differently put, frame semantics indicates that the meaning of a word can be inferred from other
words that “keep it company”, i.e. syntactically related concepts.
Syntactic networks can, thus, reconstruct a set of stances, frames and even, to a limited extent, a
fragment of the mindset of a text author, as shown with recent work about textual forma mentis
networks (TFMNs, forma mentis meaning “mindset” in Latin) (Stella 2020). Differently from other
NLP (Teixeira et al. 2021) or co-occurrence (Quispe et al. 2021) proxies to syntactic links, textual
forma mentis networks enrich AI-detected syntactic links with cognitive/synonym relationships and
affective/emotional norms to better represent the cognitive/affective content of texts. Importantly,
TFMNs use an AI to perform syntactic parsing and then, on the resulting tree of syntactic
dependencies, TFMNs link only pairs of words possessing meaning and at a distance lower than a
threshold t on the syntactic tree, rather than in the original sentence. This difference with word co-
occurrence networks crucially makes it possible for TFMNs to capture syntactic relationships
between words not adjacent or close in a sentence and yet syntactically related.
The Emotion Lexicon by Mohammad and Turney 2013). However, in the sentences “Failure and
success are both sides of the same coin. Learn how to face failure.” (see Fig. 15) it is syntactically
linked with mostly positive concepts such as “learn” and “success”. The TFMN approach thus unveils
that “failure” in that sentence is framed along a positive connotation (i.e. overcoming failure). Textual
forma mentis networks can be built through the EmoAtlaslibrary in Python
stances as well as emotional profiles of different texts. The EmoAtlas package can either be used in
Last Accessed: 22/11/2024) and, once imported, enables the extraction of TFMN edge lists and the
visualisation of specific semantic frames (like the one in Fig. 15, left) with the aid of colours and
hierarchical edge bundling (i.e. a heuristic placing nodes on a circle and putting those sharing links
closer). This granularity has been used in studies to highlight crucial differences in the ways COVID-
19 vaccines were framed by mainstream media and alternative news outlets (Semeraro et al. 2022).
sides of the same coin. Learn how to face failure.” Words are highlighted in red (black, cyan) if rated
as negative (neutral, positive) in the Emotional Lexicon. Syntactic links are coloured as the words at
their endpoints. Synonyms are in green and come from WordNet. TFMNs can be visualised as either
edge-coloured graphs (left) or multilayer networks (right).
Another compelling option for generating text for syntactic analysis is the Woseco task, short for
“word-sentence-construction” (Haim et al. 2024). Originating as a teaching method developed by
Haim and Aschauer (2022), the Woseco task aims to enhance the verbal creativity of pupils within
the context of a specific school subject. In this task, an instructor provides a technical term from a
broad category. Task participants have then to construct a factually correct sentence that not only
includes the provided category but also incorporates a second technical term - of their choice - with
which they will build another sentence, related to the category. The process is iterated several times
(Haim & Aschauer 2022). Leveraging automated analysis tools like spaCy in Python
from these sentences, building a network of syntactic dependencies that differs from TFMNs. This
integration of Woseco into syntactic analysis not only provides a valuable resource for understanding
language dynamics but can also enrich the exploration of verbal creativity in educational contexts
(Haim et al. 2024).
Syntactic parsing can also be enhanced by entity recognition. Entity recognition involves
identifying and classifying specific entities, such as names, locations, or other meaningful elements,
within a given text or context. Enhancing syntactic parsing through entity recognition allows for a
more detailed understanding of the relationships and roles of identified entities in the analysed text.
Accessed: 04/12/23) can disambiguate entities in texts, e.g. “Exeter – the University” vs “Exeter –
the city”, and draw syntactic relationships between clusters of them, such as “Exeter –> is a red brick
–> University” (Nettekoven et al. 2022). Relying on CoreNLP and its recurrent neural

netts unveiled key differences in network structure compared to healthy controls. This represents
evidence that syntactic networks can enable a deeper understanding of ways of thinking as encoded
also in texts written by clinical populations. The sentence structure and grammar of such clinical texts
can provide insight into the thought processes of clinical populations which can be better understood
through cognitive network science (Lydon-Staley et al. 2019; Parola et al. 2022).
3.4. Software for network visualisation
In analysing the above-mentioned phonological, semantic and syntactic networks, visualisation
plays an important role in giving form to the network and allowing a more intuitive understanding of
complex relationships within the network. Here, we briefly introduce igraph, NetworkX, ggraph and
tidygraph, four useful toolboxes for creating customisable network plots. Since they can be applied
for both phonological, semantic and syntactic networks alike, we discuss them in this separate section
to emphasise how they support cognitive network research across different types of networks.
For users of Python, igraph and NetworkX are practical visualisation tools. Both libraries support
easy import of networks as edge lists, adjacency matrices and a variety of built-in network measures,
such as clustering coefficients, centrality measures and path lengths. The igraph package, which is
also available in R, performs especially well on large networks and offers both 2D and 3D
user-friendly for moderately sized networks and is practical for exploratory analysis and interactive
Both ggraph and tidygraph are part of the tidyverse ecosystem in R. The ggraph package is
designed for visualising complex network structures and works seamlessly with igraph
16, which displays syntactic associations to the word “bed” in a corpus of positive hotel reviews, as
gathered in Semeraro et al. (2024). The graphical layout, obtained in Python, organises associations
along a circular layout, bundling edges so that words more interconnected with each other are closer
in the layout. This visualisation was obtained in Python, via igraph and a user-friendly package called
textual forma mentis networks from text (Semeraro et al. 2024; Stella 2020).
reviews. The bundling, obtained via igraph and EmoAtlas, organises associations along a circular
layout and bundles edges together by putting words more connected with each other closer on the
circular layout. As in textual forma mentis networks, nodes are coloured according to their valence
(cyan for positive, red for negative, black for neutral) and links are coloured according to the valences
of its connected words (e.g., links between positive words are thicker and cyan).
Users can also choose tree views, which are useful for displaying nested structures
data manipulation within network structures, allowing researchers to prepare and customise data
easily. The tidygraph package enables filtering, transforming and arranging network elements. This
can be essential for larger networks where certain nodes or edges require highlighting or adjustment
4. Limitations and Future Work
Cognitive network science is deeply rooted in the mental lexicon metaphor and in associative
knowledge modelling. Cognitive networks are powerful tools for revealing underlying structures in
data that may appear unorganised or lack explicit structure, such as raw texts, recall data or responses
from lexical tasks. By mapping these data onto a network, cognitive networks unveil patterns in the
organisation, acquisition and framing of conceptual representations that might remain hidden with
other, unstructured modelling frameworks. For example, cognitive networks outperform latent
semantic spaces in explaining similarity ratings (Kenett et al. 2017). However, there are also several
limitations to the field that should be acknowledged, discussed and potentially relaxed via future
research.
Firstly, whereas the mental lexicon is highly dynamic (Aitchison 2012; Zock 2020), most cognitive
network models are currently static, i.e. the layout of conceptual associations does not change over
time. However, pioneering studies with free associations (Dubossarsky et al. 2017; Wulff et al. 2019;
Wulff et al. 2022b) and fluency data (Cosgrove et al. 2021) have shown that indeed semantic memory
in the lexicon changes over time. Alterations in the mental lexicon can be due to various factors such
as experience, learning and exposure to new information (Wulff et al. 2022). As individuals encounter
new words and concepts, their mental lexicon dynamically adapts, incorporating new associations to
reflect evolving semantic structures and relationships (Storkel 2002; Beckage et al. 2011). Next-
generation cognitive network models should thus be able to account for time-evolving conceptual
associations. Relevant applications could be the investigation of treatment effects (Veltri 2023) or
other aspects of ageing (Wulff et al. 2022). A promising route would be the adoption of recent
frameworks like stream graphs, where individual links can appear, persist and vanish over time,
altering node centrality and network dynamics (cf. Citraro et al. 2021).
Secondly, the mental lexicon is multi-faceted (Zock 2020) and cognitive networks must
encompass multiple aspects of knowledge at once. Multiplex lexical networks already account for
multiple types of conceptual links (Stella et al. 2017; Stella et al. 2018). The combination of these
various conceptual links highlights phenomena invisible to single-layer networks, e.g. distance-based
mechanisms in predicting picture naming performance in people with aphasia (Castro & Stella 2019).
However, these models are limited to mapping only the same set of nodes across layers, e.g. only
words, whereas the mental lexicon might include elements like phonemes or sentences (Aitchison
2012), or even specific regions of the human brain activated by priming (Zaharchuk & Karuza 2021).
Multilayer networks, i.e. generalisations of edge-coloured graphs where different sets of nodes can
be linked across layers (De Domenico 2022), represent a valuable future direction for quantitative
interpretations of psycholinguistic data. With some pioneering studies investigating the multilayer
structure of language (Martinčić-Ipšić et al. 2016), future research should deploy these models for
interpreting more psychological data.
Thirdly, whereas most studies work at group level (Castro & Siew 2020), e.g. comparing creativity
between scientists and artists (Merseal et al. 2023) or across different age groups (Cosgrove et al.
2023), cognitive network models of individuals’ mental lexica might provide a major modelling
advancement. Cognitive networks generated on the level of individuals might be especially beneficial
in digital ecosystems where user-level data is already available (Mokryn & Ben-Shoshan 2021), thus
potentially mapping how individuals perceive, link and express ideas through online communicative
intentions. The SWOW database (Small World of Words,
associations at individual level (Wulff et al. 2022; Wulff et al. 2022b). This enables a granularity that
is crucial for pushing cognitive network science towards embracing individual assessment and
variability, making cognitive networks interesting objects of investigations even for researchers
already familiar with complex networks, e.g. from network psychometrics (Golino & Epskamp;
Golino et al. 2020).
Fourthly, cognitive networks are not always the best model for explaining cognitive phenomena.
Kumar and colleagues found that word embeddings obtained from the word2vec method provided
results slightly better than network distances in explaining priming data (Kumar et al. 2020).
However, the patterns reproduced by word2vec and cognitive networks differed, so that combining
model results together could be more informative. When not directly superior, word embeddings
might confirm results found through cognitive networks. Analysing narratives provided by clinical
populations, the word embedding approaches of Litovsky et al. (2022) and of Parola et al. (2022) both
identify abnormal patterns analogous to ones detected by syntactic networks in Nettekoven et al.
(2022) or described in Lydon-Staley et al. (2019). Next-generation models should use vectorial and
network aspects of the mental lexicon in synergy. A promising example is DASentimental (Fatima et
al. 2021), which combines semantic network distance and word embeddings to predict levels of
anxiety, depression and stress from combinations of emotional words. Using a cognitive network
embedding technique, a multi-perceptron model was trained that demonstrated an ability to predict
emotional distress levels in individuals with a performance comparable to that of human raters (cf.
with AI techniques might improve the explainability of the latter and power the creation of human-
centred models where associative knowledge might improve not only AI performance but also foster
novel methodological tools for computational social science and affine fields (Veltri 2023).
Last but not least, cognitive networks primarily examine the structure of conceptual connections,
yet the mental lexicon includes a distributional dimension, representing words as numerical vectors
(Kumar 2021; Litovsky et al. 2022). Addressing the challenge of reconciling these two aspects, the
recent Feature Rich Multiplex Lexical Network (FERMULEX) framework integrates both the vector
and network elements of associative knowledge. This approach reveals patterns in early sentence
production by toddlers that remain unnoticed by models solely focused on either network or vector
representations (Citraro et al. 2022). While FERMULEX considers only language-based features (e.g.
frequency, length, polysemy), future models should account also for word-level task-based features
such as concreteness (Citraro et al. 2023), specificity or how context-specific concepts are perceived
(Bolognesi & Caselli 2023) or even latency - how easily concepts can be recalled or identified (Kumar
et al. 2020; Litovsky et al. 2022). Extending network measures to feature-rich networks might also
provide additional insights over the dichotomous network/vector nature of the mental lexicon. As an
idealised system, the mental lexicon influences knowledge processing in ways mediated by vector
similarities in some phenomena and by network structure in others (cf. Aitchison 2012; Zock 2020;
Kovacs et al. 2021; Hills & Kenett 2021; Citraro et al. 2022). This underlines the need for
computational investigations of such complex cognitive systems through a multiverse approach
(Parola et al. 2022), where multiple models are compared, combined and reconciled.
5. Conclusions
This tutorial paper has explored recent advancements in cognitive networks, emphasising their
role as models for understanding human cognition and behaviour. Their applications range from
deciphering cognitive processes across visual, auditory, and semantic tasks in diverse populations to
predicting cognitive development, decline, and performance in both clinical and healthy contexts.
Additionally, cognitive networks contribute to the reconstruction of semantic framing within texts
and media. As a useful tool for modelling human behaviour, the field of cognitive networks stands
poised for growth, guided by meticulous statistical modelling, collaborative synergy with other
interpretable frameworks, and the availability of rich datasets and powerful software packages
spanning various tasks and contexts.
