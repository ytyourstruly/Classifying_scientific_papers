Abstract
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the extensive measures to
prevent a further spread of the virus have had a major impact on the daily life of families with
(adolescent) children. As in many other countries, children in the Netherlands could not
attend school for several periods, had limited (face-to-face) contact with peers, and their
structured leisure activities were often cancelled. Several previous studies showed
heterogeneity in the short-term effects of the pandemic on mental health and family
relationships during the first lockdown. The current study builds on these results by
investigating changes over a longer period (i.e., Fall 2019-Spring 2021). This study examined
the longitudinal associations among adolescents’ COVID-19-health-related stress, parent-
adolescent relationship quality, and mental health. Moreover, we studied whether personality
traits predicted changes in stress, relationship quality, and mental health tNhroughout the
pandemic using latent change score models with four waves of data from 242 Dutch
adolescents (M 11.4 years at wave 1) from the “InTransition” project. Results showed
age
significant individual differences in changes in stress, mental health, and parent-child
relationship quality, and these individual differences were overall stable within persons over
time. On average, negative interactions decreased from before the pandemic to the first
lockdown in Spring 2020. This decline was stronger forR adolescents scoring high on
conscientiousness. Furthermore, we found an overall decrease in stress from Fall 2020 to
Spring 2021, which was stronger for adolescents with high levels of agreeableness. Decreases
in negative interactions and stress were associated with improved mental health. Adolescents
thus differ in their responses to the pandemic, which has implications for future prevention
and intervention.

Since early 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the
preventive measures to control the spread of the virus have had a major impact on the daily
life of families with (adolescent) children (Brown et al., 2020; Keijsers & Bülow, 2020;
Wang et al., 2020). As in many other countries, children in the Netherlands could not attend
school or engaged in home schooling for several periods, had limited (face-to-face) contact
with peers, and their structured leisure activities were often cancelled. It has been suggested
that especially these governmental restrictions, rather than the virus itself, have impacted
adolescents (Magson et al., 2021). During the first period of the pandemic, adolescents
reported on average increased levels of mental health problems (Aknin et al., 2022; Racine et
al., 2021; Santomauro et al., 2021), and parent-child relationship quality and parenting
strategies and behavior often changed as well (Weeland et al., 2021).
As most studies investigated short-term effects of the pandemic dNuring the first
lockdown, it is important to understand the long-term impact of the pandemic on stress,
mental health, and parent-child relationships as well as how changes in preventive measures
covaried with fluctuations in stress, mental health, and relationship quality. Additionally,
given that not all adolescents are affected by the pandemic similarly, adolescent personality
might have had an effect on pandemic-related changes in stress, mental health, and parent-
adolescent relationship quality. The current study therefRore investigated changes in stress,
parent-adolescent relationship quality, and adolescent mental health from Fall 2019 to Spring
2021, and the effects thereon of pre-pandemic personality factors.
In the Netherlands, the first official COVID-19 infection was confirmed on February
27, 2020. General hygiene measures were taken and halfway March the first intelligent
lockdown was announced, including closure of daycare and schools. Primary schools
reopened by the end of April, and in the summer period most activities could go through at a
1.5 m distance. By the end of summer, the number of infections increased again, and in
October, the second wave of COVID-19 was official and a new intelligent lockdown period
started. This second lockdown period lasted until June 2021 and included some weeks of
curfew in February. During the first half of 2021, however, some perspective emerged again.
For example, the vaccination campaign started in January 2021 and schools and daycare
could reopen in February. An overview of the main events in the Netherlands as well as our
role of the pandemic in adolescents’ lives, we aimed to investigate changes in adolescents’
COVID-19-health-related stress, relationship quality with parents, and mental health in
different periods during the pandemic.
Overview of the main COVID-19-related events in the Netherlands and our data collection
waves
Changes in COVID-19-Health-Related Stress
An important reason for examining changes in mental health problems and
relationship quality during different phases of the pandemic is that levels of COVID-19
related stress are likely to have varied across these different phases (Masten & Motti-
Stefanidi, 2020; Walsh, 2020). Stress resulting from the pandemic could be related to various
aspects, including the adaptation to new roles and routines (Brock & Laifer, 2020), job loss
and socioeconomic costs or worries related to infection of yourself or close family members
(Taylor et al., 2020). For adolescents, especially the lack of social contacts might have caused
stress (Ellis et al., 2020). Levels of stress due to lack of social contacts might have varied
considerably across different periods of the pandemic in which different restrictive measures
were taken. We might expect that adolescents’ stress was largest in the early phases of the
pandemic when the uncertainty about the course of the pandemic was higNhest and the
lockdown measures limited their face-to-face contacts with peers and friends (Zacher &
Rudolph, 2021). Research on full-time employees in Germany (M 45.0 years) reported
age
declines in perceived stress from April-September 2020 (Zacher & Rudolph, 2021). At the
same time, the stress resulting from social restrictions might have increased as a result of
stressor accumulation. Many of the studies so far focused on the pandemic’s first months, yet
the prolonged duration of the pandemic might result in cRhronic stress, which might change
the impact of the pandemic on adolescent development.
Moreover, although many people experienced COVID-19-related stress because of
the huge impact and uncertainty of the situation (Qiu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), youth
and families were differentially affected by the pandemic, and they differed largely in the
extent of worrying and stress related to their health during the pandemic (Masten & Motti-
Stefanidi, 2020; Walsh, 2020). The negative impact of the pandemic on health, finances, and
social relations was often higher for those families who were already more at risk before the
pandemic, because of individual characteristics such as ineffective coping or emotion
regulation strategies, relational factors such as low family or peer support, or contextual
factors such as low SES (Mastrotheodoros & Ranta, 2022). Particularly those adolescents
who were more vulnerable before the pandemic reported the largest negative changes during
the pandemic. For example, adolescents that had specific vulnerabilities such as higher stress,
maladaptive coping, or internalizing problems before the pandemic experienced more
COVID-19 related concerns during the pandemic (van Loon et al., 2021). It is therefore
important to not only examine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic across different phases
of the pandemic characterised by different restrictive measures that made the pandemic more
or less stressful for all, but also include perceived COVID-19 health-related stress at
individual level.
COVID-19-Related Changes in Parent-Adolescent Relationships
The COVID-19 pandemic also affected family life. Especially during the lockdown
periods, many parents had to work from home, while at the same time home-schooling their
children (Shockley et al., 2020). In general, caregivers seemed to have increased authoritarian
parenting behaviors, such as fear induction practices (Ren et al., 2021), decreased autonomy
support (although this decrease seemed temporary, Bülow et al., 2021), and became more
knowledgeable of their children’s behaviors and everyday activities (Cassinat et al., 2021).
These changes might have impacted the relationships between parents and children. In a
previous paper, we found decreases in support, positive parenting, but also in negative
interactions during the first period of the pandemic (Donker et al., 2021). Also others
reported both positive and negative consequences for family life during the pandemic
(Fioretti et al., 2020). We hypothesized that in the beginning of the pandemic, relationship
quality increased, because parents and adolescents were motivated to make the best out of the
situation. Later on in the pandemic, we expected less support and more negative interactions,
as parents and adolescents might get tired of staying at home together for a long time.
COVID-19-Related Changes in Mental Health Problems
Much attention has been paid to the impact of the pandemic on mental health of
adolescents, particularly with the increasing duration of the pandemic. Over 90% of children
and adolescents in the Netherlands reported a negative impact of COVID-19 on their daily
life (Luijten et al., 2021). Meta-analyses suggest that about 25% of adolescents showed
symptoms of depression and 20% showed anxiety symptoms during the pandemic, which is
twice as much as before the pandemic. Another systematic review even reported anxiety and
depression symptoms in children and adolescents up to 50 or 60% during the pandemic
(Panchal et al., 2021). The meta-analyses showed that young people were most strongly
affected. Also, the negative effects of the pandemic on mental health incrNeased over time.
Children with special needs and existing mental problems before the pandemic were
especially at risk (Panchal et al., 2021). Previous studies have associated especially
quarantine with poorer mental health (Brooks et al., 2020; Gladstone et al., 2021).
Associations between Changes in Health-Related Stress, Parent-Adolescent
Relationships, and Mental Health Problems
Previous studies found associations between streRss, parent-adolescent relationships,
and mental health problems during the COVID-19 period (Low & Mounts, 2022). For
example, several studies found a main effect of COVID-19 related stress on self-reported
internalizing symptoms (Bernasco et al., 2021; Ellis et al., 2020; Magson et al., 2021).
Moreover, families with high stress levels might have more difficulty to adapt to the new
caregiving situation, and thus experience lower quality parent-adolescent relationships
(Brown et al., 2020; Masten & Motti-Stefanidi, 2020). On the other hand, many studies
describe a buffering effect of a well-functioning family system on stress and mental health
problems (Bokszczanin, 2008; Campione-Barr et al., 2021; Panchal et al., 2021; Prime et al.,
2020; Wu et al., 2021). Time spent with the family was for example associated with lower
levels of depression and loneliness (Ellis et al., 2020). On the other hand, increased conflict
with parents has been associated with increased mental health problems in the beginning of
the pandemic (Magson et al., 2021). We thus expect strong correlations between changes in
health-related stress, parent-adolescent relationship quality, and mental health problems,
especially in the early phases of the pandemic.
The Role of Personality in the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
Although some of the variation in effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have been
attributed to variations in health consequences and restrictive measures, individual
characteristics might also affect the impact of the pandemic on stress, mental health
problems, and parent-adolescent relationships. The Big Five personality factors extraversion,
agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to experience can be seen
as universal among humans (McCrae & Costa, 1997) and relatively stable from age 12
onwards (Borghuis et al., 2017). According to diathesis-stress models, people with different
personality characteristics might react differently to similar situations (Monroe & Simons,
1991), which makes it relevant to assess personality in stressful situations, such as the
COVID-19 pandemic, to be able to give adequate support to the groups who might need it the
most (Zettler et al., 2022). Previous studies have indeed found differential effects of natural
disasters on depression for individuals with different personality traits (Kopala-Sibley et al.,
2016) and moderating effects of certain character strengths on the association between stress
and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic (Liu & Wang, 2021).
In general, a meta-analysis has shown that overall higher levels of extraversion,
agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to experience are
associated with resilience (Oshio et al., 2018). We would expect similar results also for the
COVID-19 pandemic, except for extraversion. Adolescents scoring high on extraversion
might be hit extra hard by the contact-restrictive measures. There is some first evidence for
these effects during the pandemic. Extraverted adolescents reported more tensions at home
(Iterbeke & De Witte, 2021), and more (biological) stress (Engert et al., 2021). Moreover,
people scoring high on extraversion reported a larger rise in depressiveness, partly explained
by increased loneliness (Alt et al., 2021) and a less strong positive correlation with positive
affect during the pandemic (Anglim & Horwood, 2021). Also in an adult sample, participants
scoring higher on extraversion experienced larger increases in stress during the beginning of
the pandemic (Zacher & Rudolph, 2021), but not in the later phases of the pandemic
(Bellingtier et al., 2021; Zacher & Rudolph, 2021).
For the other personality traits, there is indeed some evidence for a protective role in
the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emotional stability was associateNd with lower
perceived stress (Bellingtier et al., 2021; Engert et al., 2021; Iterbeke & De Witte, 2021) as
well as less loneliness and higher well-being (Gubler et al., 2021). Moreover, less
emotionally stable adults reported less adaptive psychological functioning, both directly and
indirectly via diminished resilience (Zager Kocjan et al., 2021). Conscientiousness,
Agreeableness, and Openness to Experience also showed adaptive effects, such as a better
perception of remote learning (Iterbeke & De Witte, 202R1), helping others during the first
wave (Kohút et al., 2021), and seeing the COVID-19 period as an opportunity to learn new
skills (Iterbeke & De Witte, 2021), respectively.
However, most of these studies were conducted in the early phases of the pandemic,
and it is still unknown whether the effects will change with the longer duration of the
pandemic. Kohút et al. (2021) found that the effect of personality traits was lower in the
second wave (September 2020), possibly because people experienced more threat and
negative affect during the first wave, leading to amplified effects of personality (Bedford-
Petersen & Saucier, 2021).
The Current Study
The current paper aimed to answer two research questions:
1) To what extent are there changes in COVID-19-health-related stress, parent-
adolescent relationships, and mental health over the course of the pandemic?, and
2) Does (pre-pandemic) personality affect (changes in) health-related stress, parent-
adolescent relationships and mental health?
general, we expected that the impact of COVID-19 on adolescents varies over the course of
the pandemic, based on the strictness of the restrictive measures and the future perspective
COVID-19-health-related stress was first assessed at the second time point when the
COVID-19 pandemic had started. From T2 to T3 we expected an increase in COVID-19
health-related stress, as people were still worried about the future with the start of the second
lockdown. From T3 to T4 we expected a decrease in stress, as the vaccination campaign
started and restrictive measures were released (Zacher & Rudolph, 2021).
For parental support, we expected an increase from T1 to T2, but a decrease
afterwards, as parents get tired from combining working from home and caring for their
children. For negative interaction, we found a decline from T1 to T2 in our previous study
(Donker et al., 2021). We expected an increase thereafter with the longer duration of the
pandemic.
For adolescent mental health problems, we expected an increase over time, and the
strongest increase especially during the later waves, because the long-term duration of the
pandemic and the restrictive measures might take their toll (Gladstone et al., 2021; Mohler-
kuo et al., 2021).
We expected that personality affects the changes in health-related stress, parent-
adolescent relationships, and mental health. We know from previous research (before
COVID-19) that higher levels of extraversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness,
and emotional stability are associated with resilience and adaptation (Oshio et al., 2018). We
expect mainly similar results for the COVID-19 pandemic, except for extraversion, as
individuals scoring high on extraversion might be hit extra hard by the contact-restrictive
measures during the pandemic. We expected thus mainly beneficial effects for adolescents
scoring higher on openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability, but
worse effects for more extraverted individuals.
Method
Participants
Participants were 242 adolescents (M = 11.56, SD = 0.44, 50%N girls, at Wave 1)
age
who were followed for four waves across 1.5 years, starting in Fall 2019 until Spring 2021.
At the start of the study, they were in the final grade of primary school and they transitioned
to the first grade of secondary school in the summer of 2020. Adolescents identified mostly
(N = 234, 97%) as Dutch. Most adolescents (81.6%) reported living with both parents, and
12.7% reported that their parents were divorced at measurement Wave 1 (5.7% missing
values). The median parent-reported family net monthlyR income was between 4000 and 4499
euros.
Of the 242 adolescents participating at Wave 1, 173 (72%) still participated at Wave
4. We examined missingness separately for each wave (to discern it from attrition) using the
naniar (Tierney et al., 2020) and the finalfit (Harrison, 2020) packages in R. Missingness was
low and it ranged from 1.2% for personality variables to 5.7% for support at Wave 1, from
2.6% for anxiety and depression to 3.1% for support, negative interaction, and COVID-19-
health-related stress at Wave 2, from 1.5% for anxiety and depression to 5.6% for COVID-
19-health-related stress at Wave 3, and from 4.4% for anxiety and depression to 7.7% for
COVID-19-health-related stress for Wave 4. Lower levels of support at Wave 1 were
associated with attrition across Wave 2 to Wave 4, whereas boys had a higher chance of
attrition only at Wave 3. Attrition was not associated with any other variable.
Procedure
Data were collected as part of the InTransition project. The project followed
adolescents around their transition from primary school to secondary school. In the
Netherlands, adolescents make this transition around the age of 12 years. The study design
was approved by the faculty ethics board of Utrecht University. Participants were mostly
recruited through their schools. Adolescents and their parents were asked to complete
questionnaires in Fall and Spring in the year before and after the transition. For the current
study, the first data collection wave was before the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rest were
during the pandemic.
Measures
Parent-Adolescent Relationship Quality.
Parent-adolescent relationship quality was assessed using two subscales of the
Network of Relationships Inventory (NRI; Furman & Buhrmester, 1985): the Negative
Interactions scale (6 items; α = .90-.91 across Waves 1 to 4) and the Parental Support scale (7
items; α = .84-.87, across Waves 1 to 4). An example item for Negative Interactions is ‘How
often do you disagree with your parents?’ and for Parental Support ‘To what extent do your
a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (very often). Items for each scale were
averaged, where for Negative Interactions the items were first reversed, such that higher
scores indicated better relationship quality.
Mental Health Problems.
Mental health problems were assessed using two subscales of the Revised Child
Anxiety and Depression Scale (Chorpita et al., 2000): the Major Depression (10 items; α =
.80-.87 across Waves 1 to 4), and the Generalized Anxiety (7 items, α = .82-.88 across Waves
1 to 4) subscales. An example item for Major Depression is “I feel sad or empty”, and for
Generalized Anxiety “I worry about things”. Adolescents answered the questions on a 4-point
Likert scale, ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (always). Items of both subscales were averaged,
such that higher scores indicated more mental health problems.
COVID-19-Health-Related Stress.
COVID-19-health-related stress was assessed in Waves 2, 3, and 4 with four items
assessing the impact of COVID-19 on the health of oneself or one’s family or friends, made
for the needs of this study. All four items were preceded by the prime: “Since the outbreak of
the pandemic (COVID-19), how concerned have you been about …”, andN adolescents were
asked to address the four items on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much).
Example items are “…the chance that you get infected”, “… the impact of the corona
pandemic on your physical health”, “… the impact of the corona pandemic on your
mental/emotional health”. Cronbach’s alpha ranged from α = .75-.85 across Waves 2 to 4.
Items were averaged, and higher scores indicated more COVID-19-health related stress.
18 Personality. R
Personality was assessed with the Quick Big Five scale (Vermulst & Gerris, 2005),
which consists of 30 adjectives. Adolescents addressed each item on a 7-point Likert scale
from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Per scale, the 6 items were averaged:
Openness to Experience (α = .63, e.g., “Creative”), Conscientiousness (α = .80, e.g.,
“Systematic”), Extraversion (α = .79, e.g., “Talkative”), Agreeableness (α = .75, e.g., “Kind”)
and Emotional Stability (α = .78, e.g., “Nervous”, reversed).
Analytic Plan
We preregistered the following preliminary steps. First, we examined the skewness of
the distributions, in order to decide which estimators to use in the latent variable analyses.
Following Kline (R. B. Kline, 2016), if the skew index γ was higher than 3, then the
distributions would be considered highly skewed, and Maximum Likelihood with Robust
standard errors (MLR estimator) would be used to obtain more accurate parameter estimates.
Otherwise, we would rely on Maximum Likelihood estimation (ML estimator). Second, we
applied missing value analyses to examine the amount and the patterns of missingness for all
variables. Finally, we checked for item-level measurement invariance across all four waves,
for all scales separately. If the scales did not fulfill the requirement for measurement
invariance, we would test partial measurement invariance.
Longitudinal measurement invariance was tested separately for negative interactions,
support, depression, anxiety, and COVID-19-health-related stress. In each case, consecutively
more stringent models were tested examining configural (items loading on the same factors),
metric (equality of factor loadings) and scalar (equality of item intercepts) measurement
invariance. In each case, nested models were compared based on changes in the relative fit
indices RMSEA, CFI, and TLI.
To answer the research questions, we conducted Latent Change Score (LCS) analysis
using the lavaan package (Rosseel, 2012). Fit of the model was evaluated using the Root
Mean Squared Error of Approximation [RMSEA; Steiger, 1990], the Comparative Fit Index
[CFI; Bentler, 1990], and the Tucker-Lewis Index [TLI, Tucker & Lewis, 1973]. We
examined latent change across each of the three time windows (from T1 to T2, T2 to T3, and
T3 to T4).
To examine whether changes in COVID-health-related stress, parent-adolescent
relationships (negative interaction and support), and mental health throughout the pandemic
are related to each other, we added factor covariances to the model above, linking the four
latent change factors concurrently across each of the three time-windows.
Finally, we ran a model where the LCS models for COVID-health-related stress,
parent-adolescent relationships, and mental health were regressed on the five personality
dimensions. If the model with five predictors would not converge, we would then use the
personality dimensions as separate predictors in separate models. Similarly, if model(s)
including all four LCS analyses at once would not converge, then we would run separate
models for each outcome. In each of the final models, we added covariates to control for the
effects of adolescent gender, living situation, and family SES.
Schematic overview of the research questions and analyses
Results
Preliminary analyses
17 P
study variables. No variable had a skew index higher than 3; we therefore chose to apply a
Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator.
Regarding the relationship quality indices, scalar longitudinal measurement
invariance was supported for negative interactions, but not for support. For support,
inspecting the modification indices indicated that the intercepts of 4 items might be
responsible for the large decreases in fit. Releasing the intercepts of these items improved fit
but still did not support longitudinal measurement invariance. Thus, partial invariance could
not be established, either. Therefore, we decided to drop support from the main models
(results including support are still reported in the Supplementary Material). Regarding the
mental health problem indices, scalar longitudinal measurement invariance was supported for
both depression and anxiety. Therefore, we proceeded and combined these two indices into
one index of mental health problems. Finally, regarding COVID-19-health-related stress,
scalar longitudinal measurement invariance could not be supported. After inspecting the
modification indices, we decided to exclude item 4 (the only item that does not refer to
consequences on physical health), and release the equality constrain of the intercept of item 2
between W1 and W4. Therefore, partial longitudinal measurement invariance was supported
for COVID-19-health related stress.
Latent Change Score Models
To answer the research questions, we first proceeded in univariate Latent Change
Score models to examine the mean level changes in negative interactions, mental health
problems, and COVID-19-health-related stress, separately, and then we ran a multivariate
model including all three variables, to explore the associations among the change scores.
On average, negative interactions decreased (scores have been reversed) from Wave 1 to
Wave 2 and remained stable thereafter. Mental health problems remained stable, on average,
across the pandemic. Finally, COVID-19-health-related stress was stableN between Waves 2
and 3, and tended to decrease (d = -0.134, p = .084) from Wave 3 to Wave 4, but this did not
reach significance. Significant variances in all change scores emerged, indicating individual
differences in changes across the pandemic.
In addition to the mean-level changes, the multivariate model examined whether
changes in one variable were associated with changes in another. A decline in parent-
adolescent negative interactions between Wave 1 and WRave 2 was associated with a decrease
in mental health problems during the same time; the same applied for changes between Wave
3 and Wave 4. Also, increases in COVID-19-health-related stress between Wave 2 and Wave
3 were associated with increases in mental health problems during the same time. Finally,
there was a nonsignificant trend for decline in parent-adolescent negative interactions to be
associated with decreases in COVID-19-health-related stress between Wave 2 and Wave 3 (r
= -.087, p = .067).
To test the role of personality characteristics on the changes in negative interactions,
mental health problems, and COVID-19-health-related stress, we added all Big Five factors
model was suboptimal. As an intermediate step, we ran models were all Big Five factors
served as predictors of the three univariate LCS models (negative interactions, mental health
problems, and COVID-19-health-related stress). These models showed also suboptimal fit
significant effects emerged. Adolescents with higher levels of pre-pandemic
conscientiousness showed a stronger decline in parent-adolescent negative interactions
between Wave 1 and Wave 2. Adolescents with higher levels of pre-pandemic agreeableness
showed a stronger decrease in COVID-19-health-related stress between Wave 3 and Wave 4.
Several other effects that were mostly in accordance with the theoretical and pre-
registered hypotheses seemed to emerge even though they did not reach the conventional
significance levels (.05 < all following p’s < .10). Adolescents higher in conscientiousness
pre-pandemic tended to show a stronger decrease in stress between Waves 3 and 4.
Adolescents higher in extraversion tended to show a stronger deterioration in negative
interactions between Waves 1 and 2 and a stronger increase in stress between Waves 2 and 3.
Finally, adolescents with higher emotional stability pre-pandemic tended to show a stronger
deterioration in negative interactions between Waves 1 and 2, and a stronger increase in
mental health problems between Waves 2 and 3.
Discussion
This study examined the longitudinal trajectories of adolescents’ COVID-19-health
related stress, parent-adolescent relationship quality, and mental health problems, as well as
the longitudinal associations among these trajectories. Moreover, we studied whether
personality traits predicted changes in stress, relationship quality, and mental health problems
throughout the pandemic. We hypothesized significant fluctuations of COVID-19-health-
related stress, parent-adolescent negative interactions, and mental health problems throughout
the pandemic, and significant effects of all personality variables on these fluctuations.
Specifically, we hypothesized that COVID-19-health-related stress would increase from the
first lockdown (Spring 2020) to the second lockdown (Fall 2020) and would decline
thereafter; that negative interactions would decrease from before the pandemic (Fall 2019) to
the first lockdown (Spring 2020) and would increase thereafter, and that mental health
problems would deteriorate throughout the four waves of the current study. Most of our
hypothesis were only partially supported, or not supported. COVID-19-health-related stress
remained stable throughout the first phases of the pandemic, and only showed a non-
significant tendency to decrease after the second lockdown. Negative interactions indeed
decreased from before the pandemic to the first lockdown, but then remaiNned stable. Finally,
mental health problems remained stable throughout all the phases of this study. However,
significant associations among the changes in each of these concepts emerged. Personality
showed only few effects on these changes.
In line with our previous study (Donker et al., 2021), we found that overall negative
interactions decreased from before the pandemic to the first lockdown period in spring 2020.
However, this decline remained stable and did not carryR through in the later phases of the
pandemic. Parents and adolescents might thus have been able to diminish their negative
interactions during the first lockdown, and retained these more positive interaction patterns
later on during the pandemic. During the later phases, general lockdown measures were in
place, but in most cases schools were closed for only short periods and reopened as soon as
possible. The reopening of schools might also explain the association between improved
parent-adolescent relationship quality and increased mental health of adolescents. Both for
adolescents as well as for parents reopening of schools might have put the pressure off the
family system and it might have given adolescents opportunities to share their worries and
issues with peers.
The decline in negative interactions in the first lockdown period was strongest for
adolescents scoring high on conscientiousness. This is in line with past research showing that
conscientious adolescents had a more favourable adjustment to the pandemic compared to
less conscientious adolescents (Iterbeke & De Witte, 2021). This personality effect might be
explained based on the home-schooling demands imposed by the restrictive measures.
Possibly, because highly conscientious adolescents can be expected to be more independent
in following the home-schooling tasks, they might pose less of a burden for their parents, who
often also were expected to work at home. This may lead to a better parent-adolescent
relationship quality reflected in a stronger decrease in negative interactions.
Furthermore, we found an overall decrease in stress from the start of the second
lockdown period in Fall 2020 to the end of this period in Spring 2021, which was stronger for
adolescents with high levels of agreeableness. The decrease in stress might be associated with
the better future perspectives in the beginning of 2021, when the vaccination campaigns
started and everything was supposed to go back to normal relatively soon. Especially
agreeable adolescents might have had confidence in the vaccination campaign, probably
because of their heightened tendency to show prosocial behavior (R. Kline et al., 2019; Kohút
et al., 2021). That is, they might have been more willing to get vaccinated to protect others
and would have confidence that others would do the same.
Contrary to our expectations and to some of the extant empirical evidence (Racine et
al., 2021; Santomauro et al., 2021), we found no mean level change in mental health
symptoms throughout the pandemic; on average, mental health symptoms seemed to be
stable. This finding potentially reflects the general well-being of Dutch youth who, in
international studies are among the best-faring youth in terms of well-being (Inchley et al.,
2020). One recent study in the Netherlands also found that for most adolescents the pandemic
did not have a detrimental effect on mental health (Bouter et al., 2022). However, significant
variance around the mean implied significant heterogeneity; adolescents differ in how their
mental health developed throughout the pandemic. Some adolescents experience a decline
while other an increase in mental health problems (see also Bouter et al., 2022). Personality
factors could explain this heterogeneity only to a very limited extent. Adolescents higher in
emotional stability before the pandemic tended to experience a decline in mental health
symptoms during the second lockdown. This is in line with other studies who found that
adolescents who were at risk for problems before the pandemic also reported most problems
during the pandemic (Panchal et al., 2021). Especially for mental health, having pre-existing
symptoms combined with limited access to mental health care during the pandemic, might
have led to an increase of problems in this group. During future disasters Nsimilar to the
COVID-19 pandemic vulnerable groups thus need extra attention and support.
Contrary to our expectations and the results of previous studies, we found no
amplified negative effects for extraverted adolescents. It could be that this mainly has to do
with the relatively young age of our participants and the precautious measures that were taken
to reduce the impact of the restricted measures on this group. Especially in the later phases of
the pandemic, many of the contact-restrictive measures Rin the Netherlands did not apply to
them, and thus they could go to school and meet with friends. For extraverted (young) adults,
the consequences of the enduring restrictive measures might have been much more severe.
Decreases in negative interactions and stress between the spring and fall of 2020
were associated with improved mental health. This shows that resilience in one setting (for
example the family setting) might help to protect against the development of psychological
problems in the adolescent. Using a multisystem approach might thus be worthwhile, also
during disasters (Masten & Motti-Stefanidi, 2020).
Limitations and Future Directions
Our study added to previous work on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the
lives of adolescent by examining changes in stress, mental health, and relationship quality
over a longer time period (i.e., up to one and a half year into the pandemic). Moreover, by
investigating the effects of personality traits on changes during the pandemic, we were able to
tap into a potential factor explaining heterogeneity in the effects.
However, our study participants were a relatively well-functioning group, which
might have restricted us from finding strong effects on stress and mental health problems.
Also, the sample size might have resulted in power issues, which could explain the limited
number of significant effects. Some of the marginally significant findings could give some
direction to what future studies could explore in larger datasets or with more sensitive
designs. More methodologically, although we found that support in the parent-adolescent
relationship decreased during the first and third phase of the pandemic, problems with
measurement invariance restricted us from drawing conclusions on the changes in parental
support during the pandemic, although this might be a highly relevant factor in adolescent
stress and well-being. Furthermore, the Openness to Experience scale had low reliability, thus
the results for this scale should be interpreted with caution.
Conclusion
The current study showed that on average, COVID-19-health-related stress and
mental health problems remained stable throughout all the phases of the pandemic. Negative
interactions between parents and adolescents decreased from before the pandemic to the first
lockdown, and then remained stable. However, adolescents differ in their responses to the
COVID-19 pandemic, and significant associations among the changes in stress, mental health
problems and negative interaction emerged. Personality differences could only explain this
heterogeneity to a very limited extent. It is important to take into account this heterogeneity
in designing intervention- and prevention programs. Especially adolescent with existing
problems and from multi-problem families might be at risk for adverse consequences during
pandemic-like situations. Although some of the findings might be specific for the COVID-19
pandemic, we expect that most of the findings would also apply to other large-scale disasters,
such as earth quakes or floods.
