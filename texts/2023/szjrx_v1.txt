Abstract
The German Job Search Panel (GJSP) comprises survey data from workers who registered as
jobseekers expecting the termination of their jobs. The data include an exceptionally broad
range of measures of health and well-being, among other information. A first cohort was invited
to participate between November 2017 and May 2019 (Hetschko et al., 2022). In 2020, the
outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic drastically changed the macroeconomic environment of the
German labor market and, in the process, the challenges associated with job search. We
therefore decided to sample a second cohort of initially employed jobseekers from July 2020 to
February 2021 (GJSP 2.0). Combining the two GJSP cohorts allows researchers to examine if
and how the pandemic altered the experience of job search. This data report describes the
pandemic cohort of the GJSP, changes to sampling, recruitment and questionnaires compared
to the first cohort and documents determinants of participation and panel attrition.

1. Introduction
Covid-19 changed workers’ lives drastically. The highly contagious and potentially lethal
disease threatened their health. Resulting contract restrictions and lockdowns affected their
private lives. The closure of schools and kindergartens challenged working parents with
increased childcare needs. Importantly, the economic impact of the crisis turned out to be
dramatic, with the average OECD country losing one tenth of its GDP in the second quarter of
2020 alone (OECD, 2020a). Many workers lost their jobs (OECD, 2021) or took part in job
retention schemes (OECD, 2020b).
Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the German Job Search Panel (GJSP, Hetschko, Schmidtke,
Eid, Lawes, Schöb, & Stephan, 2022) was set up to survey workers’ health and well-being
during times of job search. Subjects were recruited between November 2017 and May 2019.1
In hindsight, these were normal times for jobseekers compared to the post-2019 period. The
German labor market was performing well and workers were able to quickly find a new job
after terminating an employment. The pandemic, however, affected the job search experience
because of the changing macroeconomic environment as well as the new ways in which
applying and hiring had to be conducted. We therefore decided to recruit a second, pandemic
cohort of workers for the GJSP, named GJSP 2.0, in order to study the impacts of these changes
on the experience of job search in detail. To this end, new subjects were recruited from July
2020 to February 2021. The questionnaires were kept almost identical but augmented by a few
Covid-19-specific items.
This data report describes how the GJPS 2.0 data were collected and describes differences
to the first cohort of the GJSP. Importantly, we were able to follow a number of lessons learned
from recruiting the first cohort. The report also documents patterns of selective participation,
panel stability, willingness to partake in an accompanying biomarker study as well as
participant consent to the linkage of the gathered survey data with administrative records for
the new cohort. For this purpose, we merge paradata on study participation with the so-called
Integrated Employment Biographies (IEB, version v16.01). These combine comprehensive
administrative data available from the Federal Employment Agency (Bundesagentur für Arbeit;
BA, in what follows), containing information on episodes of employment (due to social security
contributions), registered unemployment, unemployment and welfare benefit receipt, and

participation in active labor market programs which can be aggregated at the individual level
(see Jacobebbinghaus & Seth, 2007 for more details on the IEB).2 For each episode the IEB
include information on earnings, age, education, tenure and further socio-demographic
characteristics, which we use to predict individuals’ probability of signing up to the study and
other indicators of (continued) participation.
Compared to the first (pre-pandemic) cohort, the overall sign-up rate of the second
(pandemic) cohort slightly increased, while remaining at a low level. As with the first GJSP
cohort, females and relatively educated people were particularly likely to register for the study.
The general willingness to participate decreases with age, however, older participants were
more inclined than younger participants to consent to the linkage of their administrative records.
While these patterns of selective participation are remarkably similar between the two cohorts,
overall non-response bias slightly increased with the second cohort. Notably, panel stability
improved from the first cohort to the second cohort.
2. Collecting GJSP 2.0
In this section, we describe the specifics of collecting data for the second GJSP cohort. As with
the first cohort, the IAB data and information management unit (DIM) tapped the contact details
of the monthly intake of jobseeker registrations of employees who expected the termination of
their job. However, for the pandemic cohort, we only contacted jobseekers who were likely
affected by a mass layoff.3 All necessary information was directly obtained from latest process
data of the BA, with a delay of two to eight weeks after a jobseeker had been registered. If
workers became unemployed between their jobseeker registrations and sign-up with our study,
they were excluded after completing an entry questionnaire. While we required workers to be
employed when starting the survey to obtain at least one pre-unemployment measurement, we
followed them irrespective of whether or not they eventually became unemployed over the
overview of the data collection, including differences between the first and the second cohort.
Our paradata on study participation can be linked to the IEB for all contacted persons through an anonymized
person identifier. In contrast, a linkage of survey data with the IEB requires the explicit consent of participants.
We apply the thresholds for a notifiable mass layoff according to §17(1) of the German employment protection
act (Kündigungsschutzgesetz): > 5 layoffs in plants with 21 to 59 employees, 10% in plants with 60 to 250
employees, > 25 layoffs in plants with 251 to 499 employees, ≥ 30 layoffs in plants with 500 or more employees.
In addition, we assume a mass layoff in a plant of ≤ 20 employees if the staff reduced by more than five people.

One lesson from sampling the first cohort was that, among the options for contacting
participants, sending pre-announcement postal letters followed by an email works best (Lawes,
Hetschko, Sakshaug, & Grießemer, 2022). We therefore decided to use this contact mode where
possible. A single postal letter covering all necessary information was sent to subjects who did
not provide an email address in the course of their jobseeker registration. During two
recruitment months (December 2020, February 2021) we received the contact details of recent
jobseekers much delayed. In these cases, all jobseekers were contacted via a single postal letter
to avoid further delays, which would have counteracted our efforts to survey jobseekers at least
once while they were still employed.
Subjects were encouraged to participate for one year via incentives (first cohort: two years,
4 for an analysis of attrition). Respondents completed monthly surveys using an adjusted
version of the Happiness Analyzer app (Ludwigs & Erdtmann, 2019), hosted by the Happiness
Research Organization (later App Research Organization). The monthly questionnaires were
split into parts appearing over the course of up to eight days. On a quarterly basis, subjects were
invited to send in hair samples allowing us to measure the level of the stress hormone cortisol.
As for the first cohort, the laboratory analyses were performed by Dresden Lab Service.
As another consequence of our experience with the first GJSP cohort, we decided to
simplify the incentives for participation. Provided that workers completed 80% of the monthly
questionnaire, they received 10 euros in Amazon vouchers or as a cash transfer. In addition,
individuals received a loyalty bonus after participating for 13 months. They could earn another
10 euros for every hair sample sent back to the research team. Moreover, we again offered to
send them a summary information on their cortisol levels after participation.4
All items elicited from participants of the first cohort were included in the questionnaires
quarterly) was adjusted. We also added items in relation to how people experienced the Covid-
19 pandemic. Among other things, this included experience with a Covid-19 infection as well
as with taking part in the German job retention scheme, Kurzarbeit (‘short-time work’). The
scheme partly compensates for earnings losses if employers temporarily reduce working time
in times of crisis. At its peak, around 6 million workers were covered by this scheme during the
Covid pandemic (Bundesagentur für Arbeit, 2021).
Note that the first cohort and the second cohort partly overlap. For instance, participants
recruited in May 2019 for the first cohort still participated in late 2020 and early 2021 alongside
the second cohort. From April 2020 onwards, adjusted and new questions were also part of their
monthly surveys. For the wording of all questions that are not copyright-protected we refer the
reader to the GJSP Codebook (2023), which is also available on the OSF webpage of the
Individuals could borrow a smartphone instead of receiving 10 euros per month, for instance, if they did not own
one. Provided that they continuously participated in the survey over the entire year they could keep the smartphone
afterwards. 28 participants borrowed a smartphone (first cohort: 179) until no more smartphones were available.

3. Selectivity analysis
Sign-up rates
Of the 42,295 jobseekers invited to participate in GJSP 2.0, 1,889 persons (4.5%, compared to
3.7% in the first cohort) signed up for the study initially and 959 (2.3%, compared to 1.5% in
the first cohort) were kept in the final sample. 711 people who had become unemployed
between their registration as jobseekers and their study sign-up were excluded. 99 subjects were
excluded because they were still within their probationary period. In addition, 120 individuals
were excluded because they did not submit the entry survey and 58 individuals did not fill out
any surveys after the entry survey.5

up rate across the two GJSP cohorts. Note that the overall number of jobseekers contacted for
the study was lower in the second cohort because of its sole focus on mass layoffs. The sign-up
rate varied markedly during the recruitment period of the second GJSP cohort. Low sign-up
The numbers presented here might slightly differ from substantive analyses based on the GJSP 2.0 due to
differing processes of dealing with a small number of individuals who were invited more than once or who
potentially falsely claimed to be still employed at sign-up. These cases can be identified via variables in the dataset.
rates coincided with times when, for procedural reasons, the sending of study invites was
delayed and/or no pre-announcement letters or emails were sent (November 2020, December
information on the share of contact modes for each recruitment month.
Participation across groups
In this section, we describe the sample using workers’ IEB records combined with paradata
about sign-up, contact mode, recruitment month and more.6 In contrast to our data report on the
first cohort (Hetschko et al., 2022), information on sectors of industry and occupation is
included, too. All variables are measured at the time of registering as a jobseeker, i.e., shortly
before people received the study invitation. We exclude people who, according to the data, earn
unrealistically low daily wages (5 euros or less) or wages above the ceiling for social insurance
contributions (230 euros per day in 2020 for unemployment insurance in Western German
federal states, in line with Hetschko et al., 2022), which are prone to measurement error.
sample of people who signed up and the final sample of people who fulfilled the inclusion
criteria. Differences between people who signed up to GJSP 2.0 and people who were finally
included may be driven by the inclusion criteria. We treat people who did not sign-up as a
reference group to test for statistically significant differences between participants and non-
participants. As sometimes variable values are missing, we also present the number of
observations across characteristics.
In line with the first cohort, our analysis indicates that participants (signed up, final sample)
are significantly younger, more likely female, better educated, earn higher wages and are more
likely part-time employed than non-participants. The former also have less work experience
over the past ten years and spent fewer years unemployed or as welfare recipients in the past
than the latter. When it comes to sectors of industry, individuals who work in academia or
compares industries of the last job of all contacted participants from the first and the second
cohort. The first cohort is limited to participants likely experiencing a mass layoff to enable
higher share of the second cohort works in the manufacturing sector or academia, while a
smaller share works in the construction sector or as temporary agency workers.
From here on, we closely follow the analyses of the first cohort presented by Hetschko et al. (2022, Section 6).

Average non-response bias
The average absolute non-response bias (Y ) is computed separately for people who signed
absolute
up and people who belonged to the final sample. To this end, proportions (Y ) of the two groups
(S) are separately compared with the population of contacted jobseekers (JS) across categories
(k = 1, …, K) of the above variables (see Sakshaug, Vicari, & Couper, 2019; Hetschko et al.,
2022). The average absolute non-response bias is the total of all absolute differences between
compliers and the contacted population (|Y − Y , |) divided by the total number of categories:
k,S k JS
Y − Y
k,S k,JS
Average Absolute Bias = k=1
To compute the bias, continuous variables are transformed into categorical variables. We
translate them into a single binary variable (any indication / no indication) if their distribution
is highly skewed (e.g., periods of welfare benefit receipt over the past ten years). For other
continuous variables we build categories representing the different quartiles in the population
of invited individuals. While we find a bias, it is rather small in magnitude: The absolute non-
response bias is 3.6% (first cohort: 3.0%) in the group of people who sign up and 4.1 % (first
cohort: 3.7%) in the final sample. The magnitude of the non-response bias is practically the
same as that of the first cohort if we restrict the first cohort to individuals who were invited to
participate in the study after experiencing a mass layoff (signed up: 3.5% and final sample:
4.2%). Note that industries are not part of the bias computation, as they were not included in
the analysis of aggregate bias in the first cohort by Hetschko et al. (2022).
Multivariate analyses
While many characteristics vary significantly between participants and non-participants, these
characteristics might be correlated. For instance, differences in tenure and part-time work might
in fact originate from age and gender. Therefore, it is crucial for data users to learn about the
main drivers of participation which may then be controlled for in applied analyses.
To identify these key factors, we run a multivariate analysis treating participation as
logit estimates and marginal effects in percentage points. Similar to the first cohort, young
individuals and females are still more likely to sign up than elderly workers and males if other
characteristics are controlled for.

Education also continues to strongly predict the probability of signing up for the GJSP 2.0.
People with a tertiary degree are about 5 percentage points more likely to take part than people
weaken or disappear, for instance, the finding that part-time work and work experience seem to
decrease participation. All findings are remarkably similar between sign-up and final sample,
implying that exclusions after sign-up did not change patterns of selective participation. In a
nutshell, education, female gender and age remain the key predictors of participation also in the
second cohort of GJSP.
Cortisol study and consent to data linkage
Next, we examine selective participation in the cortisol add-on study as well as predictors of
consent to the linkage of a respondent’s survey records with their IEB data. Overall, 91% of
participants who were asked to agree to the linkage complied, resembling the rate in the first
cohort. Willingness to participate in the cortisol study dropped from 82% to 78%. 74% (535
participants) of participants agreed to both record linkage and participation in the cortisol study.
who expressed this willingness. It also provides figures on the relevant comparison group,
which is the subsample of all persons that were asked to send hair samples / consent to record
linkage. Differences in this respect may originate from attrition up to the time when we issue
these questions (cortisol: end of the first month, record linkage: month two and three). Similar
to the first cohort, neither cortisol participation nor linkage consent vary much across socio-
demographic and other characteristics within the final sample.
Multivariate analyses indicate that consent to record linkage increases significantly with
age (first cohort: East Germany and years of work experience also displayed positive effects).
No significant effects can be obtained for participating in the cortisol study whereas analyses
Hair sampling is an innovative way of measuring cortisol levels (Kirschbaum, Tietze,
Skoluda, & Dettenborn, 2009; Stalder et al., 2017). However, embedding such a study in a panel
survey also comes with multiple challenges. This applies all the more where hair sampling is
self-administered in the absence of an interviewer/other layperson, as in our case. Using the
GJSP paradata and survey data of both cohorts combined, Lawes, Hetschko, Sakshaug, and Eid
(2022) therefore examine participation in detail across all steps from agreeing to participate
over ordering a test kit to conducting the sampling and sending the hair back. Among other
findings, age turns out to be the single most important positive socio-demographic predictor of
actual participation in the cortisol study. Self-reported stress levels might also foster
participation, the results are significant for willingness to partake, but insignificant for actual
participation. Perhaps surprisingly, personality traits do not play a part in explaining willingness
/ actual participation.

4. Panel stability
Next, we discuss panel attrition. Perhaps as a result of learning from experience, panel stability
due to a smaller number of drop-outs during the first three months of participation. In the final
sample, the likelihood of participation in month 4 increases from 59% in the first cohort to 73%
in the second cohort. As shown by Hetschko et al. (2022), drop-outs occurred predominately
during the early days of the first cohort.
Source. Paradata on GJSP/GJSP 2.0 participation.
The selectivity of a sample changes over time if drop-outs are non-random. To investigate this
issue, we estimate the probabilities of participating after 6 and 12 months in GJSP 2.0,
conditional on the characteristics previously used to analyze sign-up. Results are presented in
6 and 13 months of panel participation. In comparison to the initial final sample, females are
about 11 percentage points more likely to participate in month 7. Education has an influence on
participation after month 12. In the data of the first cohort, females are also more likely to have
participated after 6 months while participation after one year increases with job tenure. Overall,
this provides some evidence that sample selectivity due to drop-outs seems to be small and does
not increase over the course of the study. However, in line with the first cohort, the gender gap
at sign-up widens over panel waves.

5. Conclusions
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting major economic shock in 2020, we decided to
recruit a second cohort of the German Job Search Panel, our monthly longitudinal survey on
health and well-being. The new cohort was intended to cover cases of mass layoffs over one
year after the registration as jobseeker. The survey data can be combined with information on
hair cortisol levels, administrative records on (un)employment, the so-called IEB, paradata on
study participation and, of course, the same data for the first GJSP cohort.
Similar to other smartphone-based surveys (e.g., Keusch, Struminskaya, Antoun, Couper,
& Kreuter, 2019), the sign-up rate remained low, but improved between the first cohort and the
second cohort of GJSP. Included participants were slightly more likely than before to consent
to the linkage of their survey data with administrative records, but expressed slightly less
interest in the cortisol study. Around four in five study participants agreed to these add-ons.
Patterns of selective participation are remarkably similar between the two cohorts. Sign-up
rates increase with education and are higher among females than males. These variables also
remain significant predictors of sign-up, once other descriptive differences between non-
participants and participants are accounted for. The same applies to the positive effect of age
on study participation, which is also found with regard to linkage consent, but not for taking
part in the cortisol study. The aggregate non-response bias reveals a slight increase compared
to the pre-pandemic cohort, but remains at a low overall level. This can be explained by the
focus on mass layoffs in the pandemic cohort. Panel attrition is less of an issue in the second
cohort and sample selectivity due to attrition is limited to gender and education.
We would be happy if we could ascribe the improvements in (continued) participation from
the first cohort of GJSP to the second cohort of GJSP to our own learning curve. However, the
drastic changes of many life circumstances due to Covid-19 may also have had an impact on
workers willingness to participate in scientific studies. Accelerated digitalization, working from
home and changes in time use may have modified people’s ability to partake in studies. Covid-
19 might also have affected the willingness to partake in laboratory analyses, such as hair
sampling, originating from a greater awareness of the benefits and challenges of laboratory
testing. In our specific case, the composition of jobseekers experiencing a mass layoff may also
have changed due to the differential exposure of sectors of industry to the pandemic shock. For
instance, a larger share of the contacted individuals in the second cohort worked in the
manufacturing sector.
