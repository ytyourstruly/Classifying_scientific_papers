ABSTRACT
Background: There is a need for statistical methodologies that scrutinize civilian casualties in
conflicts, evaluating the degree to which the conduct of war affects civilians and breaches the
laws of war. Employing an epidemiological method, this study introduced, developed, and
applied a novel approach for investigating mortality of civilians versus combatants in conflicts.
Methods: A deterministic mathematical model, structured by age and sex, was developed to
describe the process of conflict-related deaths among both combatants and civilians. The model
was calibrated using demographic and conflict-related data from different Israel-Gaza conflicts.
To quantify the extent of the impact on civilians and determine whether they are the primary
focus of a conflict, a statistical metric, the index of killing civilians, along with associated
criteria, was devised.
Results: The model-estimated proportion of deaths in Gaza categorized as combatants was
62.1% (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 57.6-66.2%), 51.1% (95% UI: 47.1-54.9%), and 12.7%
(95% UI: 9.7-15.4%) in the 2008-2009, 2014, and 2023 Israel-Gaza conflicts, respectively. The
index of killing civilians was 0.61 (95% UI: 0.51-0.74), 0.96 (95% UI: 0.82-1.12), and 7.01
(95% UI: 5.50-9.29) in the 2008-2009, 2014, and 2023 conflicts, respectively. These index
values indicate strong evidence for civilians being an object of war in the 2008-2009 and 2014
conflicts, but combatants were still identified as the primary focus of the conflict. In the 2023
conflict, there is robust evidence for civilians being an object of war, with civilians identified as
the primary focus of the conflict.
Conclusions: Findings imply a progressive shift in Israel's rules of engagement over time, with a
trend towards a higher threshold for acceptable civilian casualties. The 2023 conflict stands apart
from preceding Israel-Gaza conflicts, with civilians identified as the primary focus of the
conflict.

Introduction
Wars have been a recurring aspect of human societies [1, 2]. While modernity has ushered in
health, social, and economic development, it has also brought about modern warfare, often
resulting in extensive casualties [3, 4]. The majority of war-related deaths since 3000 BC
occurred in the 20th century [1]. Throughout history, various human societies and cultures have
sought to establish norms aimed at mitigating the impact of war on civilians and restraining the
deliberate targeting of civilians during conflicts [3]. A pivotal milestone in this pursuit was the
Geneva Convention of 1949, which established modern international laws of war in response to
the atrocities of World War II [3, 4]. Specifically, the Geneva Convention codified protections
for civilians during wartime and prohibited violence against them in the context of armed
conflicts [3, 4].
While humanity grapples with challenges that necessitate coordinated efforts among nations,
such as addressing diseases, ensuring access to clean water, alleviating poverty, and combating
global warming, a substantial portion of national budgets persists in being allocated to military
capabilities and the conduct of costly wars [5]. Considering the advancements in science and
technology, envisioning a world where everyone enjoys a decent standard of living, lives under
the rule of law, and has their civil, political, and cultural rights protected and respected is not a
far-fetched notion. While these ideals have materialized to a large extent within modern liberal,
democratic, and developed societies, extending them to interstate relations remains elusive.
Mitigating the impact of wars on human societies requires stringent enforcement of modern
international laws of war designed to minimize the toll on civilian populations. However,
political leaders and military entities rarely acknowledge violations of these laws, even in
situations where a significant portion of war-related casualties consists of civilians [6, 7]. They
also often employ justifications such as "collateral damage" to rationalize civilian deaths and
assert claims about the absence of intentional harm to civilians [8], making verification of true
intent challenging. Estimating and counting the number of civilian casualties in wars pose also
different challenges [9].
Therefore, there is a critical need for scientific methodologies to scrutinize civilian casualties in
armed conflicts, assessing the extent to which civilians are objects of war, determining whether
they are the primary focus of the conflict, and evaluating whether the conflict violates the laws of
war. However, and despite the importance of this matter, there is paucity of quantitative
empirical analyses of compliance with the laws of war [3]. In this article, we introduce an
approach to assess the impact of mortality on civilians compared to combatants in conflicts,
complementing other forms of evidence. The approach is rooted in methods of investigating
disease and mortality in epidemiology. A strength of this approach is its provision of a statistical
metric that directly quantifies the extent to which civilians are affected by the conflict and could
be an object of war. The establishment of more robust methods for scrutinizing and investigating
violations of the laws of war may improve the conduct of warfare with the additional scrutiny,
reducing reliance on harming civilians as a means to achieve political objectives.
Methods
Mathematical model
The occurrence of deaths resulting from war can be mathematically represented through a sex-
and age-structured population-based deterministic model. The population impacted by the
conflict encompasses both combatants and civilians, who are subjected to a hazard rate of death
related to the conflict. This dynamic process can be captured through a system of differential
equations:
𝑑𝑁(𝑖, 𝑎; 𝑡)
= −𝛿(𝑖, 𝑎)𝑁(𝑖, 𝑎; 𝑡) − 𝜇(𝑖, 𝑎)𝑁(𝑖, 𝑎; 𝑡)
𝑑𝑡
Here, 𝑁 is the population size, 𝛿 represents the combatant hazard rate of death attributed to being
targeted as a combatant by opposing military forces, while 𝜇 signifies the civilian hazard rate of
death resulting from this conflict. The subscripts 𝑖 = 𝑓 and 𝑖 = 𝑚 denote females and males,
respectively. The subscript 𝑎 indicates the age group (𝑎 = 1, … ,20), where each age group
corresponds to a 5-year age band (0-4, 5-9, 10-14,…, 95-99 years old).
Assessing whether civilians are objects of war can be done by estimating and comparing the
likelihoods of civilians and combatants being killed by the conflict. Here, the hazard rates 𝛿 and
𝜇 serve as direct metrics for the likelihood of conflict-related death, representing the "force of
killing" experienced by combatants and civilians, respectively. These metrics provide direct
measures of the effect of the conflict on combatants versus civilians. Mathematically, the 𝛿 and 𝜇
rates play a role analogous to the "force of infection" in models of infectious disease
transmission [10, 11]. They can be termed the "force of combatant killing" and the "force of
civilian killing," respectively, aligning with epidemiology terminology.
Index of killing civilians
In an ideal war with perfect adherence to international laws of war, 𝛿 has a non-zero value
depending on the intensity of the armed conflict, while 𝜇 has a value of zero as only combatants
are targeted and killed. In reality, such conflicts are not common, and civilians are affected to
some extent, leading to some non-zero value for 𝜇. Therefore, a metric is needed to quantify the
extent to which civilians are an object of war by comparing the 𝛿 and 𝜇 rates. The ratio of these
two age- and sex-population-weighted rates provides such a metric, hereafter labeled as the index
of killing civilians:
𝑛 =
The higher the value of 𝑛, the greater the extent of civilians being an object of war. This
establishes a summary metric for comparing different conflicts in terms of the impact on
civilians versus combatants.
In a conflict that strictly adheres to international laws of war, 𝑛 = 0. However, in realistic
situations, unintentional civilian deaths may occur. Criteria are necessary to characterize
different conflicts based on evidence of civilians being an object of war. Ideally, these criteria
should be established through the analysis of thoroughly-understood conflicts where the potential
for civilians being an object of war has been adequately investigated. Ethicists' involvement may
be critical in providing context for setting and defining these criteria. The criteria should also
consider the terrain and circumstances of the conflict. Unavoidable fighting in densely populated
urban areas can result in collateral damage, even without intentional targeting of civilians.
Therefore, the criteria should account for the nature of the terrain and circumstances of the
conflict.
Informed by the principle of proportionality in the international laws of war [8] and data on the
classify conflicts, ranging from those with no/weak evidence of civilians being an object of war
(𝑛 < 0.1) to conflicts with both robust evidence of civilians being an object of war and civilians
being the primary focus of the conflict (𝑛 ≥ 1.0). Importantly, when 𝑛 exceeds 1, it indicates
that the force of killing civilians surpasses the force of killing combatants in the population,
implying that civilians are the primary focus of the conflict. The threshold indicating strong
evidence of civilians being an object of war was set at 𝑛 = 0.5. At this point, 𝑛 = 0.5 signifies
that the likelihood of the conflict causing the death of a civilian reaches 50% of that for killing a
combatant—a sensible threshold for identifying conflicts with an unacceptable impact on
civilians.
Applications to Israel-Gaza conflicts
This method for investigating civilian deaths was applied to five Israel-Gaza conflicts: the 2008-
2009 conflict, the 2012 conflict, the 2014 conflict, the 2021 conflict, and the ongoing 2023
conflict. The parameter 𝜇 was assumed to be independent of sex and age, a reasonable initial
assumption given that civilian deaths typically occurs in locations where individuals of all age
and sex groups coexist, such as homes, shelters, and various other civilian settings.
𝛿 naturally varies based on both sex and age, but its specifics differ across conflicts due to
variations in the combatant profile. For this study focusing on Gaza conflict-related deaths, 𝛿
was assumed to be zero for females, as there is no apparent history of Hamas engaging females
in combat. It was also assumed to be zero for individuals below 15 and above 65 years old, as
Hamas does not appear to involve children or the elderly as combatants. The values for all other
male age groups were determined by fitting the model to the conflict data.
Data sources
This study relied on the analysis of publicly available data. Data on fatalities in the Gaza Strip by
age and sex during the ongoing 2023 conflict were obtained by analyzing the list of confirmed
deaths reported by the Palestine Ministry of Health for the period October 7, 2023, to October
26, 2023 [12]. This database encompassed 6,745 documented deaths after the removal of entries
information on fatalities available to the authors for this ongoing conflict.
Data on fatalities in earlier conflicts were retrieved from the B'Tselem database [13]. B'Tselem is
an Israeli non-profit organization concerned with documenting human rights violations in the
Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories. This comprehensive database covers all conflict-related
fatalities that occurred in the Gaza Strip between September 30, 2000, and September 19, 2023,
and includes details on individuals' engagement in hostilities.
The age and sex distributions of fatalities were extracted for specific time periods that defined
December 27, 2008, to January 18, 2009; the 2012 conflict from November 14, 2012, to
November 22, 2012; the 2014 conflict from July 8, 2014, to August 26, 2014; and the 2021
conflict from May 10, 2021, to May 21, 2021.
The aggregate numbers of conflict-related deaths calculated for these periods closely aligned
with those reported by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(UN OCHA) for these conflicts [14]. Engagement in hostilities was defined as the proportion of
individuals with confirmed participation in hostilities and those subjected to targeted killings
among those with non-missing information for this variable.
The demographic distributions of the population of Gaza by age and sex for the years 2009-2021
were obtained from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics [15]. This distribution was not
available for the year 2023, and was therefore derived by applying the population distribution by
age and sex for the year 2022 to the estimated population size of Gaza for 2023 [15]. Statistical
analyses were performed using Stata/SE version 18.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX,
USA).
Model fitting
The hazard rates 𝛿 and 𝜇 were derived by fitting the sex and age distributions of conflict-related
deaths in each round of conflict, along with the aggregate numbers of conflict-related deaths.
Model fitting employed a nonlinear least-square fitting method, minimizing the sum of squares
between all data points and model predictions. This technique was implemented in MATLAB
[16] using the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm [17].
Uncertainty analysis
An uncertainty analysis was conducted to estimate the range of uncertainty in the projected
outcomes. This process involved randomly sampling data points from the 95% confidence
intervals of the sex and age distributions of conflict-related deaths. The model was then refitted
to these data points. This process was repeated 1,000 times to generate distributions for the
estimated outcomes. Subsequently, these distributions were utilized to derive the means and 95%
uncertainty intervals (UIs).
Sensitivity analysis
The demographic composition of the Gaza population is skewed towards a younger age, with
over 50% of Gazans being under 20 years old [15]. Consequently, the model's estimates
pertaining to older age groups are less certain due to the sparse numbers of fatalities in these
categories. Moreover, the assumption that the combatant population comprises males between
15-64 years old might not accurately reflect reality, as males between 50-64 are likely
infrequently involved in combat. Consequently, a sensitivity analysis was conducted, wherein all
model estimates were recalculated, assuming the combatant population consists only of males
between 15-49 years old.
Results
Fig. 1 illustrates the model's fitting to the conflict-related death data for both males and females
across the different age groups in the five examined conflicts. The model exhibited a good fit to
the data for the 2008-2009, 2014, and 2023 conflicts. However, statistical uncertainties were
high in the 2012 and 2021 conflicts, primarily due to the relatively small number of fatalities in
introduced here is most effective for examining large-scale conflicts, as it provides statistical
population-level evidence rather than individual-level evidence.
Notably, the proportion of female deaths across age groups closely mirrored the age structure of
the population, aligning with the assumption of a 𝜇 that is largely independent of age, as
assumed in this modeling approach. The distribution of male deaths exhibited a peak among
young adults, consistent with young adult men being the primary combatant age group in the
population.
Fig. 2 shows the model-estimated 𝛿, representing the force of combatant killing, plotted against
age for the male population. Except for the 2023 conflict, a noticeable peak is evident among
young adult men in their 20s. This observation aligns with individuals in their 20s being the
predominant age group within Hamas's combatant force.
Fig. 3A presents the model-estimated proportion of deaths categorized as combatants versus
civilians. In the 2008-2009 conflict, the proportion of deaths attributed to combatants was close
to twice that of civilians. In the 2012 and 2014 conflicts, the proportion of deaths categorized as
combatants versus civilians was comparable, with a slight elevation for civilians in 2012 and a
slight increase for combatants in 2014. In the 2021 conflict, the proportion of deaths attributed to
combatants was approximately half that of civilians. The 2023 conflict stands out as singular and
distinct from all previous conflicts, with estimated deaths among civilians several times higher
than that among combatants.
Fig. 3B illustrates a comparison between the model-estimated proportion of deaths categorized
as combatants and the actual estimation based on investigating each death by B'Tselem [13]. In
the conflicts with narrow uncertainty intervals in estimates, the 2008-2009 and 2014 conflicts,
the model-estimated proportion of combatant deaths substantially exceeded B'Tselem's estimated
proportion [13]. The reason for this overestimation is likely related to the implicit assumption in
the model that the increase in the male hazard rate of death relative to females is solely attributed
to participation in combat. However, young adult men may have a higher civilian hazard rate of
death than females because they are more likely to be the primary caretakers for their families,
making them more susceptible to conflict-related fatalities while engaged in civilian activities
like procuring essential needs. This overestimation of combatants in the model suggests that
evidence generated by the present method is likely to be conservative and may underestimate the
toll of conflicts on civilians.
Fig. 4 displays 𝑛, the index of killing civilians, for the examined conflicts. In the 2008-2009 and
2014 conflicts, 𝑛 was 0.61 (95% UI: 0.51-0.74) and 0.96 (95% UI: 0.82-1.12), respectively.
focus of these conflicts was still more on combatants than civilians. In the 2012 and 2021
conflicts, the uncertainty intervals were wide in the 𝑛 estimates, but the results were still
consistent with strong, if not robust, evidence for civilians being an object of war. In the 2023
conflict, 𝑛 was 7.01 (95% UI: 5.50-9.29), much larger than 1, signifying robust evidence for
civilians being an object of war, and that civilians are the primary focus of the conflict rather
than combatants.
Fig. 5 presents a comparison of the results for 𝑛 in the sensitivity analysis, assuming the
combatant population consists only of males between 15-49 years old, with the results of the
main analysis across examined conflicts. Both the sensitivity and main analysis results confirmed
similar findings, indicating that model uncertainties arising from the smaller demographics of the
older population are not likely to impact the study's conclusions. The analysis also indicated that
incorporating individuals aged 50-64 into the combatant population led to more conservative
estimates, thereby underestimating the impact of the conflict on civilians.
Discussion
We introduced an approach for the quantitative investigation of civilian deaths in conflicts. This
methodology represents a step toward developing a broader class of methods tailored for
scrutinizing civilian casualties in conflict situations, complementing other approaches, such as
the investigation of conflict incidents, to provide evidence of whether civilians were a target of
war activity. Further refinement will enhance the approach and broaden its applicability. This
includes refining the specific criteria for categorizing conflicts using the index of killing civilians
needed to address potential variations in the civilian conflict-related hazard rate of death based
on sex and age. This may involve incorporating additional data sources, not available in this
study, into the model fitting process.
Applying this approach to Gaza deaths in five distinct rounds of the Israel-Gaza conflict revealed
key findings. Firstly, the 2023 conflict stands out as distinctly different from all preceding rounds
of conflict. The results indicate that civilians were an object of war, and importantly, the primary
focus of this specific conflict—a departure from the pattern observed in earlier rounds of the
conflict. The findings do not align with civilian casualties being attributed to collateral damage,
prompting questions about the intent behind the bombardments that resulted in such extensive
civilian mortality.
Secondly, the findings suggest a progressive shift in Israel's undisclosed rules of engagement
over time, transitioning towards a higher threshold for acceptable civilian casualties. The index
of killing civilians demonstrated an increasing trend across the conflict rounds (Fig. 4), with a
major surge in the 2023 conflict, reflecting a pronounced change in rules of engagement. Reports
from human rights organizations and news sources substantiate these findings, confirming
unprecedented documented attacks on civilians [18, 19]. These attacks have resulted in mass
civilian casualties, the obliteration of entire families, and extensive destruction of residential
neighborhoods [18].
This study has limitations. While we introduced, to our knowledge, a novel approach to
investigating civilian deaths in conflicts, further refinement of the model can enhance the
methodology's applicability and improve its capacity to generate precise estimations.
Nonetheless, the results from applying the model to the Israel-Gaza conflicts are clear-cut,
particularly in highlighting stark differences between the 2023 conflict and earlier conflicts. This
suggests that any future refinement is unlikely to alter these findings.
While the data inputs for the conflict rounds preceding 2023 are complete and well-documented,
the ongoing nature of the 2023 conflict means that its data are neither final nor complete, and are
subject to potential changes as the conflict unfolds, particularly in relation to capturing counts of
deaths and the age and sex distributions of fatalities.
The model's estimates for older age groups exhibit wide uncertainty intervals, primarily
attributable to the sparse numbers of fatalities within these small age demographics. Minor
variations in the number of fatalities within the older age groups can significantly impact the
model's estimates for these specific cohorts. Nevertheless, the model's predictions, being based
on the total population, are not likely to be influenced by these uncertainties. This assertion is
further supported by the results of the conducted sensitivity analysis (Fig. 5). Despite these
limitations, the model yielded informative results in estimating effects, and there are reasons to
consider the model estimates as conservative, potentially underestimating the true toll of the
conflict on civilians.
In conclusion, this study introduced and implemented a quantitative approach to investigate
civilian deaths in conflicts, with a specific application examining Gaza deaths in five Israel-Gaza
conflicts. The approach carries the potential for establishing statistical evidence, complementing
traditional forms of evidence, in investigating civilian deaths in conflicts. The findings
highlighted the distinctive nature of the 2023 Israel-Gaza conflict, characterized by extensive toll
on civilians, where civilians are identified as the primary focus of the conflict. The results also
suggested a progressive shift in Israel's rules of engagement over time, moving towards a higher
threshold for acceptable civilian casualties.

Fig. 1. Model's fitting to the male and female conflict-related death data across age groups in the
five examined Israel-Gaza conflicts.
Fig. 2. The model-estimated 𝛿, representing the hazard rate of combatant death (force of
combatant killing), plotted against age for the male population in the five Israel-Gaza conflicts.
Females were assumed not engaged in combat.
Fig. 3. Combatant versus civilian conflict-related deaths in the five Israel-Gaza conflicts. A)
Model-estimated proportions of combatant and civilian deaths. B) Comparison between the
model-estimated proportion of combatant deaths and the actual proportion estimated based on
investigating each death by B'Tselem [13]. No B'Tselem investigation is available for the 2023
conflict.
Fig. 4. Index of killing civilians (𝑛) in the five Israel-Gaza conflicts.
Fig. 5. Comparison of the results for 𝑛, the index of killing civilians, in the sensitivity analysis
assuming the combatant population consists only of males between 15-49 years old, with the
results of the main analysis, assuming the combatant population consists of males between 15-64
years old, across examined conflicts.
