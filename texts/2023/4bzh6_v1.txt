Abstract
The present study aims to explore and compare methods that disrupt biological motion and
examine the factors that influence the perceived mechanicalness of movement stimuli. To this
end, we first created animated characters by rendering them with natural human motion from
a public motion capture database. We then disrupted the biological motion of these characters
using four different methods that came in two types: direction-dependent or frame-dependent.
While direction-dependent methods (constant, constant+sinusoidal) disrupted the sinusoidal
trajectory of natural motion to different extents, frame-dependent methods (1015 and 1510
methods) worked by removing a certain number of frames from the movies. In order to
investigate the factors that influence how these motion stimuli were perceived, we also
manipulated the appearance of the agents as well as the actions performed. The agents came
in two types, human and robot; and the actions came in four types, namely itching,
hand-waving, kicking, and walking actions that varied in terms of the number of limbs used.
We created forty (2 agents x 4 actions x 5 motion types) 2-second videos and asked the
participants to evaluate these videos in terms of perceived mechanicalness on a scale from 0
to 10. Our findings revealed that direction-dependent methods were perceived to be more
mechanical than the frame-dependent methods. Among the direction-dependent methods, the
constant motion method was perceived to be the most mechanical. Furthermore, the robot
agent was perceived to be more mechanical than the human agent regardless of motion type
or action. Finally, walking was perceived to be more mechanical compared to the other
actions. These results emphasize the central role of direction dependency in motion and the
sinusoidal curve of the motion trajectory in biological motion perception and suggest that the
identity of the agent and the number of limbs used in performing an action influence the
perceived mechanicalness. Our findings not only characterize what makes a motion biological
but also have implications for animation and human-robot interaction studies.

1. Introduction
Imagine a squirrel climbing up to a tree to get away from a predator. When the predator takes
a step around the tree to catch the squirrel, the squirrel moves as much as it needs to remain
uncovered (James, 1907). It does not matter how many circles the predator takes around the
tree; the squirrel arranges its place on the tree so perfectly that the viewpoint of the agent can
only veer away from the position of the squirrel. The wild world is full of examples like this,
all demonstrating that detecting and interpreting the body movements and actions of others,
also known as biological motion perception, is crucial for the survival of all animals. For
humans, apart from its survival value, action perception is an important foundation for
higher-order social skills such as communication and interaction with others (Blake and
Shiffrar, 2007). Some studies even show that biological motion can be processed incidentally
even when it is outside the focus of attention (Thornton and Vuong, 2004, Nizamoglu and
Urgen, 2023; Tunca et al, 2023).
The term ‘biological motion’ was first investigated with point-light displays in the form of a
about discrete objects and events from the visual scene. He proposed vector analysis theory to
show how the visual system separates the motion of objects from the scene and encodes it in a
global reference system in the perceptual organization. Point-light displays serve not only as a
way to observe vectors but also provide a way to isolate motion from other sources of
information like the environment, the appearance of the agent, and other visual qualities of
moving agents. One advantage of using point-light displays is that it is easy to manipulate for
experimental purposes. This allows researchers to create control stimuli such as scrambled
motion by randomizing the starting coordinates of the point lights. Furthermore, one can also
manipulate the coherence of the biological motion stimuli to simulate ambiguous or degraded
stimuli that we encounter in daily life. This can be achieved in several ways. One way is to
add a number of extra dots that are randomly moving on the point-light display. In other
words, the biological motion stimulus can be embedded in noise dots. Another way is to
disrupt the configuration of the display. It is shown that if the display is shown upside down,
the perception of biological motion is impaired (Pavlova and Sokolov, 2000). This
impairment can be interpreted as an impairment in global processing. In later years, by
showing the inverted point light display with additional point dots, the global processing
effect is removed. (Troje and Westhoff, 2006; Bertenthal & Pinto, 1994). Although there is no
global configuration, people retrieve information from the upright display but not from the
inverted display. This is a remarkable contribution to the perception of the biological motion
perception in two senses. Firstly, it shows that the inversion effect is correlated not only with
global processing but also with local processing. Secondly, the scrambled dots stand as
another essential approach of the point light displays to measure behavioral and neural
thresholds (van Kemenade et al., 2012; Gilaie-Dotan et al., 2013). All of these contributions
gave a deeper understanding of fundamental processes in low-level qualities of biological
motion.
Along with the low-level qualities, there is also a higher-level concept of style, emerging as
an important factor intertwined with various elements. Humans have a distinctive ability to
discern and interpret motion styles, enabling the inference of emotions, social status (Blake &
Shiffrar, 2007), gender (Kozlowski & Cutting, 1977), sexual orientation (Ambady et al.,
1999), vulnerability to attack (Gunns et al., 2002), and intention (Becchio et al.,2008) from
biological motion. Moreover, despite variations among these biological motion styles, a
distinct holistic perception of biological motion emerges, influenced by factors like limb
relationships, environmental interactions, and speed fluctuations. Establishing a foundation
for describing this unique style necessitates distinguishing between biological and
non-biological motion. Taking a developmental perspective, animals' visual systems respond
to both living and non-living entities in motion (Grossman et al.,2000; Grèzes et al., 2001),
prompting inquiry into how the brain distinguishes between them. Animacy perception,
achievable solely through kinematics, underscores morphology's role (Martin and Weisberg,
2003; Pyles et al., 2007). Notably, noise disrupts animacy perception in non-biological
entities, revealing morphology's significance. Researchers have used several control stimuli
ranging from simple moving dots to movements of objects (Pavlova and Sokolov, 2000;
Peuskens et al., 2005, Cook et al., 2009) and reported behavioral and neural differences in the
perception of biological motion. Therefore, the contribution of the relationship between
motion flow (Neri et al., 1998) and form (Beintema et al., 2006) to the perception of
biological motion stands as a solid criterion but the relationship itself remains elusive.
To shed light on the effects of motion flow and morphology on the perception of biological
motion, robots can be valuable tools because they can be morphologically very similar to
humans but their kinematics are different and usually defined as mechanical motion (Saygin
et al, 2012; Urgen et al 2018). The concept of robot motion presents an intriguing blend,
merging elements of Troje's theories on both 'animate motion' and 'relative motion'. It exhibits
a dynamic interaction among its body limbs akin to relative motion, yet it pertains to an
object, aligning with the principles of animate motion. This dual nature establishes a
distinctive characterization: while the motion belongs to an object, its characteristics resemble
biological motion, presenting an intriguing interplay of cues that seemingly conflict. Several
studies show that humans are more responsive to such stimuli that have a mismatch between
their surface features (Saygin et al., 2012; Macdorman et al., 2009; Mitchell et al., 2011;
Meah et al., 2014; Urgen et al., 2018).
By changing or distorting the parameters in biological motion and checking if it constitutes a
mismatch with the biological qualities might help to understand what people perceive as
non-biological or mechanical motion. There are plenty of studies that have introduced
different methods to disrupt biological motion. For example, Cook et al. (2009) propose that
constant velocity might be a characteristic of non-biological motion in a study in which
biological motion perception abilities of people with autism spectrum disorder were
compared with a control group. Their study differentiates two types of motion, which are
named minimum jerk motion and gravitational motion. Within the 'minimum jerk' condition,
a human hand image exhibits a vertical sinusoidal movement, whereas the 'gravitational'
condition involves a tennis ball undergoing a downward vertical movement with constant
velocity—representing a non-biological object. The results show that thresholds in the
sinusoidal-minimum jerk condition are significantly lower than the constant
velocity-gravitational condition in the control group. Therefore, constant velocity is
considered to be a characteristic of non-biological motion. In this study, the constant velocity
parameter is introduced to participants in the form of ‘animate motion’; in other words, as a
motion of a rigid object that moves over space. However, it is not known how this method
would work for objects with ‘relative motion’ where the object is not rigid but rather
possesses dynamic changes of the simultaneously moving limbs as in the case of robots and
humans.
Along with the sinusoidal structure, as another feature of biological motion, the two-thirds
power law is the expression describing the relationship between the kinematics of motion and
the geometrical features of a circular path of the hand during drawing; of the eye during the
following behavior; of the body during a walk through (Rosenbaum, 2009). In an MRI study,
this law is used as a parameter of biological and non-biological motion produced by violating
the law (Dayan et al., 2016). In the experiment, a human-like avatar and an abstract object
deviating from the human avatar move in three different fashions; natural, hyper-natural, and
counter-natural. In the natural fashion, the motion is completely compatible with the
two-thirds power law. In the counter-natural condition, kinematics is contradictory to the
natural condition, so, motion speed is higher in the curved parts of the path while lower in the
straight parts of the path. In the hyper-natural condition, the kinematic violates the natural
conditions in a way that it is even slower in curved parts and much faster in straight parts.
Results show that the default mode network differentiates non-biological and biological
motion for the human-like avatar, but not for the abstract object. According to this
experiment, hyper and counter-natural motions seem like parameters for non-biological
motion. However, as the constant velocity parameter in Cook et al. (2009), it is not known
how the methods that produced hyper and counter-natural motion would apply to non-rigid
objects that possess relative motion such as the body movements of humans and robots.
Like animate motion studies, there are also relative motion studies in the investigation of
non-biological motion. Thompson et al. (2011) propose three different unnatural kinematic
parameters to measure the perception of the relationship between humanness/familiarity and
the eeriness of moving agents. In their experiment, a mannequin and a human animation walk
with four different flows: biological, articulated, phase offset, and jerky motion. The first
category, articulation, was shown to be an important parameter in the perception of biological
motion in some studies (Beauchamp et al., 2002). The second category, the phase relationship
between limbs is also known as an important factor (Casile and Giese, 2005). In the
articulated motion condition of the experiment of Thompson et al. (2011), joint rotation of the
limbs is reduced and animated agents move with stiff arms and legs. In the phase offset
condition of the experiment, the fluidity of the motion is reduced by manipulating the phase
relationship between the opposing limbs. In the last condition, an implausible jerk is added to
the action. The results show that the ratings of the synthetic agents by human observers do not
show an uncanny valley effect (Mori, 1970) but rather show monotonic changes.
Furthermore, researchers reported no difference between a mannequin and a human in terms
of familiarity and eeriness. So, the methods employed in the study (articulation, phase offset,
and jerkiness) are not considered to be important determinants of non-biological motion.
However, there is a possibility that a mannequin and a robot might give different results if the
same methods are employed in a robot animation as suggested by research on the uncanny
valley (Saygin et al., 2012; Urgen et al., 2018).
In another study in which the relationship between the limbs is manipulated, Piwek et al.
(2014) create four different unnatural motions which are distorted versions of the same arm
motion. These four motion flows are produced by increasing the intensity of the same
distortion method. Their method resembles the phase offset condition in the study of
Thompson et al. (2011). In their method, the shoulder joint is locked while the elbow is
allowed to move and the elbow joint is locked while the shoulder joint is allowed to move.
The intensity of the distortion changes according to the duration of the locking period. The
longer duration in the lock means more intensity in the distortion. According to their results,
improving motion quality improves the acceptability of characters with different appearances
(battle robot, toy robot, skeleton, mannequin, zombie, lo-man, hi-man). Therefore, the most
distorted motion flow takes the lowest acceptability ratings. The battle robot with natural
motion has lower acceptability ratings than hi-man with natural motion. Moreover, the battle
robot with the most distorted motion has higher acceptability ratings than the hi-man with the
most distorted motion. These results imply that phase offset might be a parameter of
nonbiological or mechanical motion when robot morphology complements the motion.
However, the use of phase offsets requires further research in which more limb and offset
combinations are considered in the investigation.
The present study aims to address the limitations of previous work and provide a systematic
way of characterizing and measuring non-biological motion. To this end, we introduced four
methods that disrupt the biological motion of two animated characters, a human and a robot.
To fill in the gap in the literature, these methods were applied to actions that require the
movements of multiple limbs. Furthermore, the actions varied as a function of the number of
limbs that were used while performing the action. We then measured how mechanical human
participants perceive these movement patterns.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Participants
230 adults (older than 18) participated in the study through an online platform (Qualtrics).
The sample size was determined by using G-power as 197 to achieve 80% power for
detecting a medium effect (0.40), at a significance criterion of α = .05. The study was
approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Bilkent University, and informed
consent was obtained from the participants at the beginning of the online study.
2.2 Stimuli
The stimuli consisted of 40 videos, each lasting 2 seconds. The videos depicted four different
actions performed by two different agents with five different movement trajectories. The
agents were a human and a robot character which were downloaded from the Unity Asset
one representative exemplar from putative action classes in the human repertoire (Orban et al,
2021), 2) have a single actor, 3) have actions that consist of large movement trajectories so
that it is easy to distinguish biological from non-biological motion (e.g., ingestion consists of
minimal movement so any modification in its movement trajectory would not be visible at all
whereas walking consists of large movements so it can be modified easily). Among the
actions we selected, kicking belongs to the manipulation class, hand waving belongs to the
communication class, walking belongs to the locomotion class, and itching belongs to the
self-directed action class (Orban et al., 2021). The motion capture data for these actions
were taken from motion capture data archives of Carnegie Mellon Graphics Lab
with these data and they constitute the characters with biological motion in our stimulus set
and the bottom row shows the robot character. A and E’ refer to the kicking action; B and F refer to
the hand waving; C and G refer to the walking; D and H’ refer to the itching. Each of these
In addition, we used 4 different methods to disrupt the biological motion in the motion
capture data and created the so-called “mechanical” motion types. The first method created
mechanical motion by erasing certain frames in the video. In place of the erased, the constant
function is applied to the last and the next keyframes. Frames are erased unrelatedly to
direction changes, with inconsistent timing between direction changes and the constant
function onset. In this method, 15 frames are deleted and 10 frames remain biological within
each 25 frames, so the method is called 1510 motion. In this way, all limbs that were moving
were stuck (locked) in the last pose for 15 frames and started back to moving in a sinusoidal
fashion. Sinusoidal motion lasted for 10 frames. Stucking or locking phases resemble the
phase offset condition of Thompson et al. (2011) and all distorted motion conditions in Piwek
et al. (2014) except for the fact that all limbs were locked at the same time in the present
study.
The second method is called 1015 motion which is the same as the method of 1510 except for
the fact that it is the reversed version of it in a temporal manner. It means that within each 25
frames, 10 frames were deleted, while the next 15 frames remained biological. Therefore, all
moving limbs were stuck (locked) in the last pose for 10 frames and started back to moving in
a sinusoidal fashion. The sinusoidal motion lasted for 15 frames.
The third method is called constant function motion. In this method, the manipulation was
directly applied to the direction changes in the motion trajectory, therefore, each direction
change was taken into account. All trajectories were deleted except for the edge points. Then,
the constant function in Blender 2.93 (2021) is applied to these edge points. In this way, the
motion lost its sinusoidal structure completely. All moving limbs were stuck in the last pose
until they instantly moved to the second pose.
The last method is called constant+sinusoidal motion and is produced by considering the
motion pattern of robots. For a robot, the procedure of applying a goal state requires a certain
amount of time. In this method, each direction change in the motion was accepted as a new
goal. For each goal, the trajectories in the first 10 frames were deleted and the constant
function was applied to the start and end trajectories of these 10 frames. Then, the sinusoidal
part of the motion was left as it was. Therefore, all moving limbs were stuck (locked) in the
last pose for 10 frames and started to move back in a sinusoidal fashion.
biological motion data; B, C, D, and E are the distorted versions of A. Specifically, B is constant
motion; C is 1510 motion; D is 1015 motion; E is sinusoidal+constant function motion.
These mechanical motion patterns were applied to each action category (locomotion, kicking,
hand waving, and itching) for both agents (human and robot). After the motion manipulations
and character animations, the data are transferred to Unity 2020.3.6f for better lighting and
environmental conditions. 40 videos (2 agents x 4 actions x 5 motion trajectories) were
produced in a way that the 3D agents were placed in front of the camera equidistantly. The
color of the background and the ground were selected as gray. Video recordings were
extracted from Unity with 128 frames and saved in mp4 format.
2.3 Procedure
The experiment was introduced to the participants in an online setting (Qualtrics, 2023).
Participants were recommended to participate in the experiment via their computers, not their
phones or tablets. At the start of the experiment, the descriptions of biological and mechanical
motion were introduced to the participants. Biological motion was described as the motion of
living things such as humans and animals. On the other hand, mechanical motion was
described as the motion which deviates from biological motion. This deviation was stated to
be seen in various ways such as the discreteness in the motion flow or changes in the speed of
motion. After reading these descriptions, participants were presented with the stimuli in five
sets for a total of eight pages (2 agents x 4 action pairs). On each page, they saw five videos
of either the robot or the human agent with 5 different motion flows for a given action. They
were required to rate the mechanicalness of the motion in the animation videos from one to
ten by using the slider placed under the videos. One referred to the lowest mechanical motion
value, while ten referred to the highest mechanical motion value. On every page, a different
action category was introduced to them. The sequence of the action categories and motion
flows was randomized. For instance, the first video that one participant encountered in the
experiment might be a hand-waving robot with constant velocity motion, while another
participant might encounter a kicking human with biological motion.
3. Results
In the present study, there were three independent variables with 2 (Agent) x 4 (Action) x 5
(Motion type) levels and one independent variable called mechanical motion value scaling
from 0 to 10. A Shapiro-Wilk test was performed on the square-rooted version of the data and
it showed that the distribution of all independent variables across the mechanical motion
value departed significantly from normality. Among agents, both human (W = 0.856, p-value
< 0.001) and robot (W = 0.853, p-value < 0.001) deviates from normality. All actions,
namely, handwave (W = 0837, p-value < 0.001), itching (W = 0.858, p-value < 0.001),
kicking (W = 0.83, p-value < 0.001) and walking (W = 0.815, p-value < 0.001) deviates from
normality. Similarly, all motion types namely 1015 (W = 0.860, p-value < 0.001) 1510 (W =
0.885, p-value < 0.001) both con+sin (W = 0.794, p-value < 0.001) cons (W = 0.743, p-value
< 0.001) and biological motion (W = 0.936, p-value < 0.001) departed from normality. Based
on this result, a two-step linear mixed model analysis was run in Python using the
Statsmodels library. In both steps, we included mechanical motion value as the dependent
variable. The first step was performed to compare the models of main effects and the second
step was performed to compare the models of interaction effects on top of the main effects
identified in the first step. The model specifications were as follows:
Step 1 - Main effects:
Model1 :"Value ~ Agent", groups=["Participant"]
Model2 :"Value ~ Action", groups=["Participant"]
Model3 :"Value ~ Motion", groups=["Participant"]
Model4 :"Value ~ Agent+Action", groups=["Participant"]
Model5 :"Value ~ Agent+Motion", groups=["Participant"]
Model6 :"Value ~ Action+Motion", groups=["Participant"]
Model7 :"Value ~ Agent +Action+Motion", groups=["Participant"]
The first step analysis was conducted to see if there was a main effect of the independent
variables, namely, agent, action and motion. Different models including different numbers of
variables were constructed and their AIC and BIC results were compared to find the best
value, indicating the best trade-off between goodness of fit and model complexity. Similarly,
according to BIC, Model 7 (agent + action + motion) had the smallest value, suggesting
optimal model performance. Considering both criteria, Model 7 (agent + action + motion)
was identified as the best-fitting model. This result reflected that the model is the best when
all the variables included, implying that agent, action and motion types have main effects.
Model1 Model2 Model3 Model4 Model5 Model6 Model7
Agent Action Motion Action+ Motion+ Motion+ Agent+Action
Agent Agent Action +Motion
AIC 43792.6 43536.8 40928.4 43536.5 40926.2 40567.7 40565.27
BIC 6.23 6.058 4.53 6.06 4.53 4.35 4.35
Step 2 - Interactions:
Model 8 : "Value ~ Motion + Action + Agent + Action*Motion", groups=["Participant"])
Model 9 :"Value ~ Motion + Action + Agent + Action*Agent", groups="Participant"])
Model 10 : "Value ~ Motion + Action + Agent + Motion*Agent", groups=["Participant"])
Model11:"Value~ Motion + Action + Agent + Agent*Action + Motion*Action", groups =
["Participant"])
Model 12:"Value ~ Motion + Action + Agent + Motion*Agent + Motion*Action", groups =
["Participant"])
Model 13:"Value ~ Motion + Action + Agent + Motion*Agent + Agent*Action", groups =
["Participant"])
Model 14: "Value ~ Motion + Action + Agent + Motion*Agent + Agent*Action +
Motion*Action", groups = ["Participant"])
The second step analysis was conducted to see if the best main effect model would be
improved by the addition of the two way interactions, AIC and BIC results of the models (8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) were compared to find the best interaction model. The AIC and BIC
Action + Agent + Agent*Action + Motion*Action) exhibited the best trade-off between
goodness of fit and model complexity. However, according to BIC, Model 8 (Value ~ Motion
+ Action + Agent + Action*Motion) resulted in the smallest value and the most optimal
model performance. The combination of both AIC and BIC prefered Model 11 as the
motion*action interaction and the agent*action interaction are included in it along with the
main effect variables. On the other hand, Model 14 including all two way interactions were
agent*motion interaction does not have a significant contribution to the model.
Model 8 Model 9 Model 10 Model 11 Model 12 Model 13 Model 14
AIC 40439.4 40556.7 40575.6 40430.5 40449.7 40567.01 40440.8
BIC 4.32 4.35 4.37 4.32 4.33 4.37 4.33
The difference between the best interaction model and the best main effect model was AIC =
134.77 and BIC= 0.02 in a way that the lowest values belong to the best interaction model.
The difference indicated that the model improved when the interactions are included.
Post-hoc analyses on the main effects and interactions:
The linear mixed model analysis showed the best-fitting model including all variables and
two of the interactions. To see the relationship between the levels of variables, a post hoc test
was conducted. Data were not found homogenous according to Levene’s test for action (F(3,
9196) = 5.078, p < 0.01) and motion (F(4, 9195) = 8.90, p < 0.001). Since data is both non
normal and non homogenous, the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test is conducted.
The best main effect model which is Model7 (agent + action + motion) demonstrated that the
robot agent (β = 0.131, z = 2.980, p = 0.003) had a significantly higher coefficient than the
human agent (β = 6.521, z = 52.211, p < 0.0001). The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test results
supported this result by showing that the movements of the robot agent (M = 6.425, SD =
2.976) were perceived to be more mechanical than the human agent (M = 6.294, SD = 2.989)
(T = 2346926.0, p < 0.001).
while orange represents the robot agent.
Model7 used handwave (β = 6.380, z = 56.367, p < 0.001) as the intercept and compared the
other action categories with it. Examining their coefficients, walking (β = 0.583, z = 9.396, p
< 0.001) was perceived to be more mechanical than handwaving; kicking (β = -0.637, z =
-10.265, p < 0.001) was perceived to be less mechanical than handwaving. There was no
significant difference between hand waving and itching (β = -0.027, z = -0.442, p = 0.659) in
terms of their perceived mechanicalness. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank post hoc results
confirmed the results. To account for multiple comparisons, a Bonferroni correction was
applied, and the significance level was adjusted to α = 0.0083. Results showed that walking
(M = 6.96, SD = 2.916) was perceived to be more mechanical than hand waving (M = 6.380,
SD = 3.086) (T = 716828.5, p < 0.001); itching (M = 6.353, SD = 2.869) was perceived to be
more mechanical than kicking (M = 5.743, SD = 2.933) (T = 794335.5, p < 0.001). There was
no significant difference between hand waving and itching in terms of their mechanical
perception value (T = 833025.5, p = 0.9892). All of the other pairwise comparisons were
significant. Walking was not only perceived as more mechanical than hand waving but also
more mechanical than itching (T = 586036.5, p < 0.001) and kicking (T = 572167.0, p <
0.001). Therefore, participants perceived walking as the most mechanical among the four
action categories. In addition, hand waving was perceived as more mechanical than kicking
(T = 461800.0, p < 0.001).
handwave with orange; itching with purple; and kicking with pink.
Model7 took the 1015 motion (β = 6.521, z = 52.211, p < 0.001) as the intercept and the 1510
motion was found less mechanical than the 1015 motion (β = -0.172, z = -2.485, p = 0.013).
The coefficient of biological motion was also found less than 1015 motion (β = -2.657, z =
-38.318, p < 0.001). The differences between coefficients showed that biological motion was
also found less mechanical than 1510 motion. The coefficient of constant motion was the
highest and it was also found significantly more mechanical than 1015 (β = 1.062, z =
15.316, p < 0.001). The coefficient of both constant and sinusoidal motion was less than
constant motion but it was significantly more mechanical than 1015 motion (β = 0.733, z =
10.575, p < 0.001). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test with α = 0.005 confirmed these results.
The mechanical motion value of the constant function motion (M = 7.629, SD = 2.712) was
significantly higher than the constant+sinusoidal function (M = 7.299, SD = 2.709) (T =
204663, p < 0.005). The method of constant+sinusoidal functions was perceived to be more
mechanical than the 1015 method (M = 6.566, SD = 2.671) (T =221229 , p < 0.005). The
1510 method was perceived to be more mechanical than the original biological motion (M =

mechanical than 1015 (T = 33.56, p < 0.005), 1510 (T = 209440.0, p < 0.005), and biological
motion (T = 132975.0, p < 0.005). The 1015 method was significantly higher than the 1510
method (M = 6.394, SD = 2.525) (T = 311590.5, p < 0.005). Therefore, the constant motion
was perceived to be more mechanical than the other motion types.

orange; and 1015 motion with turquoise.
The best interaction model was the Model 11 in which the Agent*Action interaction and
Motion*Action interaction were included but the Agent*Motion interaction were not. The
Model 11 took handwave action of human agent as the intercept and compared the intercept
with the actions of robot agent. Since the aim in the present study is to compare each action
through different agents, the post hoc test brought more clear results. According to the
Wilcoxon Signed-Rank with α = 0.003, this interaction is driven by the significantly higher
mechanical perception value of the robot agent in kicking (T = 128324.5, p < 0.001) and
handwave (T = 108706.5, p < 0.001) actions compared to the human agent. There are no
statistically significant differences between robot and human agents in itching (T = 159682.5,
p = 0.07), and walking actions (T = 167447.0, p = 0.37).
in terms of the perceived mechanicalness. The human agent is represented with turquoise, while the
robot is represented by orange.
According to Model 11, the action*motion interaction was significantly contributing the
model.The Wilcoxon Signed-rank test with α = 0.00071 showed that the biological motion
was perceived to be significantly less mechanical than the constant (T = 8508.0, p < 0.0001),
constant+sinusoidal (T = 9010.5, p < 0.0001), 1015 (T = 11071.0, p < 0.0001), and 1510 (T =
10434.5, p < 0.0001) in handwave action. For kicking, again, biological motion was
perceived to be significantly less mechanical than the constant (T = 7107.5.0, p < 0.0001),
constant+sinusoidal (T = 7959.0, p < 0.0001), 1015 (T = 12388.0, p < 0.0001), and 1510
methods (T = 9887.0, Z = -15.92, p < 0.0001). Similar to the other two actions, for walking,
biological motion has significantly lower mechanical values than constant (T = 9237.0, p <
0.01), constant+sinusoidal (T = 9750.0, p < 0.0001), 1015 (T = 11982.5, p < 0.0001), and
1510 (T = 10843.0, p < 0.0001) methods. The same pattern holds with itching. Biological
motion has lower mechanical values than constant (T = 8371.5, p < 0.0001),
constant+sinusoidal (T = 8581.0, p = 0.0000), 1015 (T = 11030.0, p < 0.0001), and 1510
methods (T = 9859.5, p < 0.0001). In terms of the relationship between biological motion and
the other motion types, the same pattern holds for all actions.
The constant function method is found to be more mechanical than the constant+sinusoidal
function in kicking (T = 7870.0, p < 0.0001), and handwave (T =14552.5, p < 0.0001)
actions but not in walking (T =12353.0, p = 0.7), and itching (T = 16280.0, p = 0.01). This
result shows that the difference between the constant+sinusoidal method and the constant
method is driven by the kicking and handwave action. On the other hand, the 1015 method
was not found to be more mechanical than 1510 in any of the actions except for itching (T =
24373.0, p = 0.0002). The difference is not significant in walking (T = 16517.5, p = 0.01),
kicking (T =25480.5, p = 0.98), handwave (T = 13367.5, p = 0.001). The difference between
1015 and 1510 motion seems to be driven by the difference in itching action.

4. Discussion
In the present study, we introduced five distinct motion types involving both human and robot
agents. These techniques were applied to four various actions that involve the use of multiple
limbs. Our primary goal was to investigate which motion pattern was more likely to be
perceived as mechanical compared to others, and whether the involvement of different agents
and actions played a role in shaping this perception. Our findings indicate that the perceived
level of mechanicalness varies across agents, actions, and motion patterns.
Importance of Motion Flow in Perceived Mechanicalness
As expected, our results indicate that biological motion, which is the motion of a real human
captured with motion capture techniques was found to be the least mechanical among the
other motion types. On the other hand, there were differences in perceived mechanicalness
among the other motion types that were created by disrupting biological motion. They came
in two types: direction-dependent and frame-dependent. Among the direction-dependent
manipulations, the constant-motion method was found to be significantly more mechanical
than the both-sinusoidal-and-constant-motion method. The key distinction between these two
methods lies in the absence of a sinusoidal structure in the constant method. In this method,
the endpoints of the trajectories remain intact, and a constant function is applied between
these endpoints. As a result, the agents seemed to be stuck at a pose and make small jumps
from one trajectory to the nearest, when the direction of the motion changes. Therefore, it
moves accordingly with the direction changes and also has no sinusoidal structure. It means
that it carries the meaning of the action but what makes a motion biological is completely
erased from it. This lack of sinusoidal trajectory might be the reason why it has the highest
mechanical motion value. In the both-constant-and-sinusoidal-motion method which has the
second highest mechanical motion value, we applied the constant function to each direction
change of the limbs for ten frames and we left the rest as sinusoidal. In this motion type, the
trajectory does not lack sinusoidal curves; however, its manipulations are direction-dependent
as the constant-motion method. It is direction-dependent in the sense that trajectory
manipulations start each time the motion trajectory changes. This situation might imply a
necessary condition to constitute a meaningful motion. If the disruption starts randomly, as in
frame-dependent conditions in our study or jerky motions in Cook et al. (2009) and
Thompson et al. (2011), it might not be associated with mechanicalness. Jerky motion is a
sudden change in the trajectory and it does not change the flow of the motion but it changes
the meaning of it by adding a new endpoint to the trajectory. Therefore, instead of any
perception of mechanicalness, it might be associated with an error in the motion itself or the
perception of it. It appears crucial to disrupt motion while still preserving some of the
features. Overall, the findings in the present study demonstrate that the direction-dependent
disruptions in motion capture data were perceived to be the most mechanical.
On the other hand, frame-dependent manipulations of motion (1015 and 1510 motions) were
found to be less mechanical than direction-dependent manipulations. In these methods, the
direction changes in the motion trajectory were not taken into account, and the only
manipulation was in the number of frames removed. We hypothesized that a more sinusoidal
curve in the motion trajectory (removing less number of frames) would result in less
perceived mechanicalness. However, this hypothesis were rejected since 1510 motion is
found less mechanical. This might be due to the number of frame parameters being
non-optimal across the different methods. On the other hand, it is important to note that
removing so many frames may end up clearing off the meaning of the action, and it was
actually what we wanted to preserve during the manipulation. Future research can potentially
use action videos of longer duration and play with this parameter to investigate whether
perceived mechanicalness would change.
Why a lack of sinusoidal trajectories is perceived as more mechanical than the other motion
types might be related to the mechanism of the muscle contractions observed in natural
actions. If a human encountered an unexpected obstacle on the road they were walking, they
would suddenly stop by contracting the muscles in their legs and feet. However, although
they do it by using the lower parts of the body, the upper body swings. The movements of the
upper body in this context are called anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs). APAs occur as
increasing activity of muscles and they stabilize the body motion (Rosenbaum, 2009; Aruin et
al., 1998) APAs reflect expectations about postural needs and the brain controls postural
reflexes in an adaptive way (Latash, 2008). These reflexes are used in Pearson’s flexor burst
generator model for walking (1976) as a mechanism to periodically excite flexors and inhibit
extensors. For example, when humans are waving hands, a hand is periodically going left and
right. In this periodic action, if they move the hand towards the head, they are flexing the
bicep muscles and extending the tricep muscles; if they move the hand towards out, they are
extending the bicep and flexing the tricep muscles. Each direction change reflects muscle
movement. The constant velocity motion seems to violate the principles of the flexor-extensor
model in terms of the extensor’s existence. Flexing/contracting a muscle causes a sharp,
instant motion while extending a muscle causes a swing or a steady motion. This sharp
characteristic might be equivalent to the stance phase of Pearson’s model, swinging
characteristic with swing phase. In the constant motion, all direction changes are instant,
therefore, there is only motion resembling a flexing. The absence of a motion pattern
resembling extension might be what makes constant motion seem more mechanical from a
human standpoint. However, it's worth noting that both extending and flexing motions are
important components of an action. Not only the absence of APAs might lead to the
perception of mechanical motion, but their presence could add to the meaningfulness of the
motion. In the production and identification of the mechanical motion, it is important to avoid
jerkiness and hold the meaningfulness of the motion. Therefore, the relationship between
APA and non-biological motion demands further research.
APAs are also able to explain the results of Piwek et al. (2014) and Thompson et al.(2011) as
it does to our study. In their study, the shoulder joint is locked while the elbow is allowed to
move and the elbow joint is locked while the shoulder joint is allowed to move when the
agent is making a hand gesture. In the first part of a human hand waving, muscles related to
the elbow joint are flexed, and muscles related to the shoulder joint are extending, and
swinging. In the second part, it is vice versa. Locking the shoulder joint while allowing the
elbow to move also causes a shortage of swinging in half of the motion. The reason is that
although the first part seems like a reasonable trajectory for the human body, the second part
seems like a struggle. This situation might explain the lower acceptability ratings of the more
human-like agent (hi-man) and higher ratings of the less human-like agent (battle robot) in
the most distorted motion condition in Piwek et al.(2014). Although they are placed in
different intervals of the motion, their study has both stance and swing phases shaped by
direction changes in the trajectory, resembling the both-constant-and-sinusoidal motion in our
study. Conversely to these methods, the constant motion in our study has no swing phase and
higher perceived mechanicalness than the rest. Thus, it might support the idea that disrupting
APAs is a good strategy for investigating the difference between biological and
non-biological or mechanical motion.
Importance of Agent Appearance or Identity in Perceived Mechanicalness
In the present study, the perceived mechanicalness of the robot agent was found to be higher
than the human agent although they perform the actions with the same kinematics. The
difference between human and robot agents suggests that prior knowledge about robots and
humans might be an important parameter in perceived mechanicalness since we are
accustomed to seeing biological motion on humans and mechanical motion on non-human
objects. This familiarity might be triggering a prediction mechanism in which the appearance
of an agent acts as a prior to predicting the nature of movements (Saygin et al., 2012; Urgen
et al., 2018; Urgen and Saygin, 2020) in the predictive processing framework (Hohwy et al.,
2008; Clark, 2013; Friston et al., 2013). Although it may be a matter of debate whether the
motion or the appearance of an agent is prior to the other, this kind of hierarchical system of
priors (Kemp et al., 2007; Tenenbaum et al., 2011; Clark, 2013) seems plausible to explain
the agent difference found in the present study. These results can further guide research in
human-robot interaction and 3D animation to find out the optimal agents that can be accepted
by human end-users.
Importance of Action Type in Perceived Mechanicalness
Along with the agent differences, there are also action differences in perceived
mechanicalness. In the study, disruptions are applied to several actions that vary in terms of
the number of limbs that are utilized while performing the action. Walking is found to be
more mechanical than the other action categories while kicking is found to be the least
mechanical. The perceived mechanicalness of the hand waving and itching actions have
medium values, and their difference was not significant. These results imply a relation
between the perceived mechanicalness of an action and the number of limbs used in the
action. In walking action, a lot of limbs (both arms and legs) are dominantly used; in kicking
action, only one limb (leg) is dominantly used; in hand waving and itching, two limbs (arms
and hands) are dominantly used. This result supports the idea that biological and
non-biological motion have their own ‘styles’. The more one is exposed to the mechanical
motion style in the visual scene, the more one perceives it as mechanical. One interesting
thing to notice is that motions have different perceived mechanicalness values in different
actions. For example, 1015 motion is found to be more mechanical in hand waving action
than kicking action which shows that actions affect the perceived mechanicalness. However, a
similar interaction also exists for biological motion. For example, biological motion has the
highest mechanicalness value in walking action compared to the other actions. One possible
underlying reason might be the use of animation techniques and presenting the stimuli on a
2D computer screen. Several studies show that observing physically present agents benefits
the task performance as compared to observing virtual agents (Li, 2015; Thellman et al,
2016). Given the recent push in favor of doing more naturalistic studies in psychology and
neuroscience (Snow & Culham, 2021; Nastase et al.,2020; Matusz et al.,2019; Risko et
al.,2012) and recent methodological developments to present real agents and live actions
(Pekcetin et al, 2023), future work can test the perceived mechanicalness of agents in
real-world scenarios.
5. Limitation and further studies
There are several limitations that require attention in future research. One is the lack of
understanding regarding the relationship between APA (Anticipatory Postural Adjustments)
and biological motion. We hypothesize that the utilization of APA may significantly influence
motion perception. More specifically, the absence or abundance of APA might alter the
interpretation of motion—its absence could change the motion's significance, while its
presence could render the motion more biologically inclined.
In the creation of mechanical motions within the present study, various methodologies were
explored to generate motion trajectories that preserve intended meanings while potentially
losing their biological attributes. For instance, alongside the 1015 and 1510 motions, different
combinations were attempted. This involved producing a 10-20 motion, where 20 frames
retained a sinusoidal pattern instead of the extraction of 10 frames and retention of 15 frames,
as in the 10-15 motion. Additionally, motion variations like 20-10, 3-5, and 5-3 were
generated. Interestingly, while the 3-5 and 5-3 methods preserved the biological features of
motion, the 10-20 and 20-10 methods resulted in a substantial loss of trajectory information,
leading to a loss of their intended meanings. The reasoning behind selecting the 1015 and
1510 motions for the study was their apparent ability to convey action meanings while
simultaneously differing from biological motion. However, the higher perceived
mechanicalness value of 1015 motion rejects our hypothesis that more sinusoidal curve
means less mechanical motion. Therefore, the temporal constraints governing trajectory
disruptions remain unknown.
However, it remains crucial to delineate the boundary between meaninglessness and
biological aspects. This necessitates a precise definition of biological versus non-biological
motion characteristics and demands a clear distinction achieved through the utilization of
APAs. Defining these aspects and discerning between them by benefiting the potential of
APAs appears to be a fruitful direction for further research.
Another limitation of our study is the utilization of a limited range of action categories
compared to the broader spectrum suggested by Orban et al. (2021). This decision stemmed
from methodological considerations. For instance, activities like climbing necessitate
environmental stimuli in addition to the agent, posing challenges in controlling both the
action and its environmental context. Similar complexities arise in scenarios involving
interpersonal interactions. When the experimental scene involves two agents, factors beyond
the action itself come into play, such as personal space length, gaze direction, and relative
positions of the agents. These additional elements convey substantial information that could
influence the perception of biological motion. Thus, presenting two agents within the visual
scene for participants amplifies the difficulty in controlling stimuli that are inherently
challenging to manage even with a single agent. Future research could systematically
manipulate these factors while constructing mechanical motion, exploring their individual
impacts on perceived mechanicalness.
6. Conclusion
In summary, our research examined the concept of perceived mechanicalness within motion
patterns, exploring actions involving both human and robot agents utilizing multiple limbs.
The primary goal was to discern which motion types were more inclined to be perceived as
mechanical and how the involvement of different agents and actions impacted this perception.
Our findings revealed important relationships between perceived mechanicalness and motion
patterns, agents, and actions.
To begin, we observed that motion variations significantly influenced perceived
mechanicalness. Not surprisingly, biological motion derived from real human actions (from
motion-capture data) was perceived as the least mechanical. Additionally, the disruptions in
motion—especially direction-dependent (constant-and-sinusoidal motion, constant
motion)—played a substantial role in altering perceived mechanicalness. Disruptions
maintaining certain motion features, particularly in direction-dependent manipulations,
contributed to increased perceived mechanicalness, emphasizing the significance of
purposeful motion alterations. Importantly, the absence of a sinusoidal curve in the trajectory
increased the perception of mechanical motion, with the constant function method emerging
as the most associated with mechanicalness.
Secondly, distinctions between agents were notable, with participants generally perceiving
robot agents as more mechanical than their human counterparts. The appearance of agents
played a central role, indicating that familiarity with human-like versus non-human-like
agents influenced predictions of mechanicalness.
Additionally, differences in actions revealed a correlation between perceived mechanicalness
and the number of involved limbs. Actions engaging more limbs tended to be perceived as
more mechanical, hinting at the tendency for humans to recognize patterns of mechanical
motion linked with increased limb usage.
These findings emphasize the need for further exploration into the distinctions between
biological and non-biological motion and the cognitive processes influencing our perception
of mechanicalness, especially within the context of visual perception and human-robot
interaction.
