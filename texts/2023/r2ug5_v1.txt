Abstract
As a new, highly complex, and far-reaching technology, autonomous driving can be
associated with various fears and uncertainties. However, recent findings show that high trait
anxiety can positively contribute to the intention to use autonomous vehicles. An explanation
for this is that the possibility of handing over one's driving control to an AI is even more
relieving for more anxious people. Our study aimed to test whether this explanation can be
supported by investigating to what extent this relationship can be applied to buses in which
control is handed over per se – in the conventional bus to a driver, in the autonomous bus to
the AI. We also analyzed how the fear of giving up control mediates the relationship between
the trait anxiety and the intention to use. In a quasi-experimental study, 253 subjects were
surveyed while riding an autonomous or conventional electric bus. The results confirmed a
positive association between trait anxiety and intention to use in the overall sample but not in
the autonomous and conventional subsamples. Contrary to our assumptions, fear of giving up
control served as a slightly suppressive but not significant mediator. The results were
independent of whether control was handed over to a human driver in the conventional
electric bus or to AI in the autonomous bus. Our study thus provides fundamental new
insights into the acceptance of autonomous vehicles and buses in general and opens the door
for subsequent research based on these findings.

Introduction
Autonomous driving has gained increasing attention in recent years and is already
beginning to make its first steps into our daily road traffic [1; 2]. In pilot projects worldwide,
artificial intelligence (AI) replaces humans as drivers. In just a few years, autonomous
vehicles (AVs) are expected to account for 50 % of new vehicles [3]. In this wake, a huge
research field has opened around autonomous driving. In recent years, in addition to technical
feasibility, the focus has increasingly been on factors that contribute to humans' successful
adoption of AVs.
Literature Review and Research Framework
The person of the user with their individual perception, attitude, and personality is a
crucial adjusting screw for the successful establishment of AVs [4; 5]. In this context,
potential uncertainties and worries regarding new, largely unknown technologies such as AVs
also play an important role [6]. Autonomous driving in general seems to be associated with
various fears and anxieties [6]. Fear of machine movement and concerns about the
predictability and reliability of autonomous systems still prevent users from developing trust
in autonomous driving technology [7; 8]. In addition, there are fears regarding data security
and driving safety [6; 9]. Overall, AVs are still perceived as riskier compared to conventional
vehicles, although they even promise to improve road safety [10; 11].
The worries, fears, and perceived risks can unsettle users [9; 6]. While perceptions of
safety decrease with a higher level of automation, the perceived anxiety increases [12].
Access to AVs in public transportation is currently severely limited, so corrective experiences
are still rare [6]. Prior experience with AVs may favor the adoption [13]. In a simulation
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
study, Park et al. [14] showed that subjects experienced less anxiety the longer they drove an
autonomous vehicle. Regarding autonomous technologies, anxiety lowers the intention to use
(ITU) AVs, preventing positive experiences [15]. On the other hand, anxiety and concerns are
also compensated by positive expectations regarding driving safety and the risk of accidents,
which in turn can reduce the anxiety of potential users [6]. Although various fears burden the
acceptance of AVs, contrary study findings also demonstrate a positive effect of anxiety. Qu
et al. [16] found in a study among drivers of self-driving cars in China that individuals with
higher trait anxiety attributed higher reliability to autonomous driving systems and were more
willing to adopt AVs. The authors explained their unexpected positive effect by suggesting
that more anxious individuals may be less afraid of the errors of an autonomous driving
system than of their own human errors. According to their conjecture, the subjects' anxiety
was less about losing control and more about "taking back control from a self-driving car"
[16, p. 2674].
The issue of control has been addressed many times in the AV context. It is a key
issue for many decision-makers and interest groups in several respects regarding the
successful implementation of AVs [17–19]. While developers and manufacturers are
responsible for producing vehicles in a technical way that enables them to take over driving
control reliably and as comfortably as possible, legislators and policymakers focus on the
questions of who carries the responsibility when driving control is handed over and which
regulations are required to ensure the protection and safety of all parties involved [19].
Ensuring the willingness to give up control actively and thereby encouraging the broad public
use of AVs is a central concern of operators and providers [19]. Other road users (e.g.,
pedestrians) are indirectly affected by the delivery of control to AVs if they have to rely on
the technology to interact with them reliably and safely in an encounter. However, AV users
are probably the most central starting point for relinquishing control to AVs. In other words,
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
the successful use of AVs depends on the passengers’ active willingness to give up control.
Accordingly, a great focus of research in this context has been on this target group [20].
Previous findings show that people differ in terms of their need for control and that this
impacts AV acceptance [21]. A high need for control has a negative effect on the ITU of AVs
[21]. In contrast, an external locus of control, i.e., the belief that events are not self-caused
but are caused by external factors [22], leads to higher ITU [23]. It is possible that giving up
control is easier for individuals when they see the control in external influences rather than
having a higher internal locus of control [23]. Hegner et al. [24] specially examined the fear
of giving up control in the context of AV acceptance and found that a low fear of giving up
control, along with trust in AVs, positively affects the acceptance.
If the possibility of handing over control is indeed decisive for the direction of the
correlation between trait anxiety and the acceptance of autonomous cars, as hypothesized by
Qu et al. [16], the question arises as to what extent this effect can also be shown for buses. In
contrast to autonomous cars, the main question for autonomous buses is not whether one's
control is handed over, but to whom: the human driver or the autonomous technology.
Strauch et al. showed that subjects report lower confidence when they are driven in a
simulator by an autonomous system instead of a male or female driver [25]. Results like this
might suggest that people generally prefer riding a conventional bus to riding an autonomous
bus. Therefore, if anxious people generally prefer to use buses because they can hand over
driving control, we assume that they nevertheless choose to hand over control to a human
driver rather than to the AI in AVs. According to this reasoning, individuals with high
anxiety would prefer riding in conventional buses with human drivers to riding in
autonomous buses. We would like to point out that the term autonomous can currently only
be interpreted with restrictions. AVs cannot yet handle the complexity of every traffic
situation completely and at all times [26]. Rather, we are in an interim phase in which AVs
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
drive autonomously in standard traffic situations but rely on so-called teleoperation in
dangerous situations. In this case, human operators perform monitoring and driving in control
centers until the vehicle has left the dangerous situation [26]. Psychological research does not
yet differentiate between AVs with and without the use of teleoperation. We, therefore, also
use the term autonomous with the restriction that an operator takes over driving control in
critical situations.
Research Hypotheses
The studies demonstrate the relevance of the trait anxiety for the development of AV
acceptance. Understanding the impact of trait anxiety in this context can allow developers
and providers to design and promote AVs with a greater focus on people who have a high
level of anxiety, e.g., by specifically highlighting the control transfer option for this target
group. Nevertheless, the previous research findings in this context still show substantial gaps
and unexplained aspects. It currently remains to be answered how the somewhat
contradictory results can be explained. This study aims to understand the role of anxiety and,
in this context, the prerequisites for the acceptance and ITU of autonomous shuttle buses in
more detail to derive implications for the successful establishment of autonomous buses.
To this end, we examine the relationship between trait anxiety and ITU. Qu et al. [16]
suggested that more anxious individuals are more willing to hand over control. Accordingly,
this willingness in turn has a positive effect on the ITU of AVs in which driving control can
be surrendered to the AV technology. We, therefore, examine the extent to which the
relationship between trait anxiety and ITU is mediated by fear of giving up control, which, to
the best of our knowledge, has not been investigated so far.
Buses present a particular case in this context because the passenger on the bus
(unlike in a car) cedes control as standard, either to the AI in the AV or to a human driver on
the conventional bus. Therefore, we examine to what extent the relationship between fear of
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
giving up control and ITU, as well as the relationship between trait anxiety and ITU, depends
on the so-called bus modality (autonomous vs. conventional). This study is, to the best of our
knowledge, the first to compare the acceptance of autonomous and conventional buses in
terms of the influence of trait anxiety and fear of giving up control. This comparison helps us
to determine the role of autonomous technology in this context and to differentiate the effects
from the conventional bus modality. Based on the above considerations, we derive the
following hypotheses (Fig 1).

TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
Method
Design and procedure
We conducted a quasi-experimental questionnaire study with two between-subject
conditions (autonomous vs. conventional) to investigate the effect of trait anxiety on ITU
through fear of giving up control. In the autonomous condition, we collected data from
subjects on-site while driving an autonomous bus, in the conventional condition, we collected
data from subjects while driving a conventional (electric) bus. We attached importance to the
fact that the buses in the conventional condition drove with electric drive to grant better
comparability to the (anyway electrically driving) autonomous buses. The survey was carried
out in Regensburg between October 2022 and July 2023. In this period, autonomous buses
were piloted on a ring route in the industrial park. The subjects were surveyed exclusively
during their journey with the respective bus to ensure that the sample only included persons
who had used the bus. Data was collected via the online service SosciSurvey. Beforehand, the
subjects were informed about the purpose of the study, their rights, and data protection. All
participants gave their informed consent digitally by clicking a checkbox. They then
answered questions about their sociodemographics, personality, mobility behavior, and their
perception and experience with autonomous buses or conventional buses, depending on
which bus they were currently using at the time of the survey. The data were stored
anonymously and are available in the OSF repository
by the Regensburg Ethics Committee (# 22-3088-101).
Sample
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
A minimum sample size of N = 214 was determined a-priori using the software
G*Power, version 3.1.9.4 to ensure an overall power of .80 (f = .15, α = .05). The sample
(N = 253, of which 106 were male, 144 were female; age: M = 26.68, SD = 11.18 with a
range of 16 to 76 years) was recruited via personal approach in the buses and student subject
platforms. It comprises 127 subjects (50.20 %) surveyed while driving with an autonomous
bus and 126 subjects (49.80 %) surveyed while driving with a conventional bus. Three
subjects under 16 years of age were excluded from study participation beforehand.
Participation in the study was voluntary and was not financially remunerated. Psychology
students received credit for their participation as part of their coursework.
Instruments
In our study, we used a set of questionnaires to collect information on
sociodemographics, personality, mobility behavior, and perceptions and experiences with
autonomous or conventional buses. Permission was obtained in advance for all instruments
used in the study for which it was required. The sociodemographic variables included gender,
age, education level, occupation, and income. The mobility behavior scale included two
questions on frequently used means of transportation and two items on liking car or public
transportation use.
For the survey of trait anxiety, we used the German short form of the trait scale of the
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [29]. The eight-point Likert scale (1 = almost never to
8 = almost always) assessed ten statements about personal indicators (e.g., I get tired
quickly.) Cronbach's ɑ was high at ɑ = .85 [30]. For fear of giving up control, we developed
five items, rated on a five-point Likert scale (1 = do not agree at all to 5 = strongly agree)
following Hegner et al. [24] (e.g., I am concerned that I have no control over the
[autonomous] bus.). Cronbach's ɑ reached ɑ = .86, indicating high reliability [30]. We also
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
surveyed the ITU with four items according to Korkmaz et al. [31] on a five-point Likert
scale ranging from do not agree at all (1) to strongly agree (5, e.g., I plan to use
[autonomous]-electric public buses frequently in the future.). The reliability of this scale was
high (Cronbach's ɑ = .85) [30].
All bus-related items were adapted in their wording to the respective bus modality
(autonomous vs. conventional). The study was conducted as part of a large research project
on autonomous driving. Therefore, in addition to the scales relevant to our study, the
following were also collected: Technology Readiness Index 2 [32]; perceived safety adapted
from Xu et al. [33]; environmental concerns [34]; perceived sustainability, self-developed;
environmental self-efficacy [35]; knowledge about AVs, self-developed; previous experience
with AVs, self-developed, General Self-Efficacy Short Scale (German: Allgemeine
Selbstwirksamkeit Kurzskala) [36]. These variables are not considered in our study. An
overview of all items and scales used is available as a codebook at
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using R statistical software (version 2023.12.0) with the lavaan
and semtools package [37; 38]. As the examination of the outliers through boxplots showed,
all of the conspicuous data values were within the plausible range, so we did not exclude
them [39; 40]. We then reviewed the requirements for the mediation analysis [41]. Our data
were collected independently. Therefore, we assume independence of the error terms (no
autocorrelation). We confirmed the linearity of the correlations graphically using a scatter
plot with a fitting curve. To check for possible multicollinearity, we considered the Pearson
correlation coefficient of the predictors, which was not significant and unremarkable at
r = .05. Furthermore, the normal distribution and homoscedasticity requirements were not
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
met in our data. We, therefore, additionally calculated the mediation analyses using
bootstrapping with 1000 iterations. This procedure is considered robust to violations of the
normal distribution and homoscedasticity [42; 43]. We first examined the relationship
between trait anxiety and ITU in terms of mediation by fear of giving up control. We
performed a mediation analysis for the total sample, the autonomous condition, and the
conventional condition (H1, H2). We then compared the mediation models of the two
conditions using a multigroup analysis (H3). This procedure is used to uncover possible
differences in the mediation models between the autonomous and conventional conditions
[44]. A significant result indicates significant differences between the groups [44]. The used
data set and analysis code are available in the OSF repository
Results
Descriptive statistical analysis
skewed in both the autonomous and conventional conditions, suggesting that the sample
generally showed an open attitude toward bus use. Overall, ITU was lower for AVs than for
conventional vehicles. The mean value of trait anxiety was similar to the results of Qu et al.
[16]. On a four-point scale, they found a mean trait anxiety value of M = 1.94. This is similar
to our value of M = 3.74 on the eight-point scale. Noticeably, the autonomous and the
conventional sample differed significantly in trait anxiety and fear of giving up control, with
lower trait anxiety and higher fear of giving up control in the autonomous condition. To
further explore this result pattern, we decided to plot the fear of giving up control as a
function of trait anxiety and bus modality using a scatterplot (Fig 2). The graph shows a
relatively low fear of giving up control for conventional buses across all trait anxiety values.
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
For autonomous buses, the fear of giving up control varied more, with higher values as trait
anxiety increased.

Inferential statistical analysis
We examined the association between trait anxiety and ITU for mediation by fear of
giving up control each for the total sample, the autonomous, and the conventional condition.
276 The sample size (N = 253) ensured an overall power of .99 (f2 = .15, α = .05) . The results are
This positive relationship was evident in both conditions, being stronger for conventional
buses than for autonomous buses. However, the association in both conditions did not reach
significance (H1 a and b rejected). These results of the total effect were also found using
bootstrapping, total sample: b = 0.09, p = .018; autonomous sample: b = 0.01, p = .890;
conventional sample: b = 0.10, p = .082.Trait anxiety overall contributed to the variance
resolution with a small effect of ΔR² = .02 [45]. When the mediator was included, this direct
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
effect slightly increased for the total sample as well as for both subsamples, with significant
direct effects for the total sample and the conventional subsample. A similar pattern was
evident with the use of bootstrapping, total sample: b = 0.09, p = .008; autonomous sample:
b = 0.03, p = .620; conventional sample: b = 0.10, p= .050.This phenomenon is known as
suppression and indicates that the mediator damps down, rather than strengthens, the positive
association between trait anxiety and ITU [41]. This was confirmed when analyzing each
mediation pathway in more detail. Contrary to our prior hypotheses, trait anxiety positively
predicted fear of giving up control in the total sample, but also in both subsamples. However,
the relationship only reached significance in the autonomous condition. Fear of giving up
control had a negative effect on ITU, which was significant for the total sample and the
conventional subsample but not for the autonomous subsample. Overall, the indirect effect on
ITU was negative. Nevertheless, the indirect effect of fear of giving up control did not reach
significance, neither for the total sample nor for autonomous buses and conventional buses.
This result for the indirect effect was also found using bootstrapping, total sample: ab = -
0.01, p = .506; autonomous sample: ab = -0.02, p = .130; conventional sample: ab = -0.00,
p = .859. Therefore, we reject H2 a and b.
The multigroup analysis revealed no significant difference in the models between the
autonomous and the conventional conditions. This implies that the proposed mediation model
was independent of bus modality, t(3) = 4.96, p = .175. Therefore, H3 is not confirmed.

Discussion
Summary and practical implications
Our study aimed to investigate whether trait anxiety is associated with the ITU of
autonomous buses and to what extent this relationship is mediated by fear of giving up
control and dependent on the bus modality. Before discussing the results, we would like to
emphasize again that the term autonomous in this context means that the vehicle drives
autonomously in standard situations. In critical situations, operators take over the monitoring
and driving via teleoperation (see introduction section). In total, three main findings emerge
from our study:
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
First, we found a positive influence of trait anxiety on the ITU across both conditions.
This result was also evident for the subsamples, although not significantly, but on a
descriptive level. These findings are of special interest. They show that although autonomous
driving may be associated with various fears according to some studies, e.g., [46; 47], this
does not mean that more anxious individuals are generally more skeptical about AVs. The
contrary is observed here. We can conclude from the above results that autonomous and
conventional buses seem particularly attractive to more anxious individuals. Our study thus
extends the results of Qu et al. [16] first, by the perspective of real AV users, and second, by
the context of autonomous and conventional buses. This shows that the positive association is
not only evident in autonomous cars but also in autonomous buses and conventional buses. In
practical terms, this means that anxious people are not the more critical target group at all
when it comes to AVs. Rather, this target group seems to see an advantage in AVs. The
results also suggest that more anxious individuals may even see an advantage in both
autonomous cars, autonomous buses, and conventional buses [16]. In terms of successful
practical implementation, this means that this target group does not necessarily require
extraordinary attention, e.g., in terms of design or a particular familiarization with AVs.
Rather, it is now an important next step to identify why people with higher trait anxiety are
more open to AVs. By understanding the underlying mechanisms, conclusions can be drawn
to further address more anxious users and possibly even win them as promoters or initiators,
e.g. in AV marketing. With regard to policy regulations, the results of this study might
suggest that this target group does not initially need to be specifically considered or
protected. At this point, however, we would like to emphasize that the current state of
research shows that fears and insecurities, which are highly associated with trait anxiety,
nevertheless have an impairing effect on AV acceptance [17; 6; 48; 46]. Therefore, we advise
being careful in inferring that trait anxiety or anxiety in general does not need any
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
consideration in policy regulations. Further research is needed to test and replicate the results
of this study to allow for practical derivations for policymakers. Although the correlation
between trait anxiety and AV acceptance was significant for the overall sample, this effect
did not reach significance for the subsamples (autonomous and conventional, H1 not
supported). Our results are, therefore, not fully consistent with the findings of Qu et al. [16]
One reason could be the reduced sample size and thus reduced power in the subsamples [49].
Qu et al. [16] collected their data among the general population, regardless of their previous
AV use. The authors thus achieved a sample size of N = 527. However, no experience with
autonomous driving technology can currently be expected. To ensure the validity of the
results, we therefore decided to conduct an on-site survey among users of autonomous and
conventional buses. Within the research project, we only had access to autonomous buses for
a defined period in which the data could be collected. A further increase in the sample size
was therefore not possible in this time span, particularly for the autonomous bus. It is
possible that (unlike in the study by [16]) existing smaller effects were therefore not revealed.
Another reason for the non-significant effect could be that Qu et al. [16] focused on
autonomous cars, not autonomous buses. It is possible that using a car is more attractive to
anxious people than using a bus, e.g., because the person is not sitting in a car with strangers,
unlike on a bus. This might increase the influence of trait anxiety on the ITU of private
vehicles and thus make it more evident. The relationship may also be influenced by other
variables, such as unconsidered moderators, due to which the effect of trait anxiety on ITU is
not fully revealed. A variable that may have influenced the mode of action of trait anxiety is
dispositional trust. Previous research shows that trust is an important determinant of ITU [50;
20; 51]. Thus, it is possible that trait anxiety has a lower effect on ITU when confidence is
high because the autonomous technology may be perceived as less threatening. Conversely, a
low level of trust could lead to the trait anxiety having a stronger effect on the ITU. An
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
interaction of trait anxiety with another variable (e.g., trust) cannot be ruled out and could
(possibly in combination with the smaller sample size) explain why the effect on ITU was
limited in our study. We recommend further investigating possible previously not considered
moderators, particularly trust, in future studies to clarify this. However, the positive, although
not significant, relationship between trait anxiety and ITU AVs in our study already indicates
that trait anxiety may also have an affirmative role in the use of autonomous buses.
Second, we found that the opportunity to hand over driving control is not the crucial
factor/aspect that promotes the ITU of anxious people. We investigated the relevance of fear
of giving up control as a potential underlying mechanism of this relationship. Here, we were
able to show that, contrary to our assumptions, fear of giving up control does not account for
the positive relationship between trait anxiety and ITU (H2 not supported). Based on the
assumption made by Qu et al. [16] discussing their results, we supposed that more anxious
individuals would prefer to hand over control to other entities (in our study, the AI vs. the
human driver) rather than taking driving control themselves. Accordingly, a high fear of
giving up control would in turn have a negative effect on the ITU of autonomous and
conventional buses. However, our results do not support this assumption. In our study, there
was no significant mediation by fear of giving up control.
In this context, it is noteworthy that trait anxiety and fear of giving up control showed
significant differences between the subsamples. In particular, the fear of giving up control
showed little variance in the conventional condition, with lower values (see Fig 2). This is
surprising because we expected the two variables and their association to be independent of
bus modality. It is possible that the fear of giving up control is particularly stimulated when
control is handed over to an abstract autonomous technology. Previous research has already
shown that people have greater trust in a human driver than an autonomous driving
technology [25]. The fear of giving up control would therefore also be dependent on bus
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
modality. Nevertheless, our results also show that trait anxiety has a significant influence on
the fear of giving up control, however, only among users of autonomous buses. Some studies
suggest that anxiety is particularly strong in situations that are associated with uncertainty or
threat [52; 53]. Possibly, the use of autonomous driving technology represents a comparable
situation because the technology is still difficult to grasp and hardly accessible [6; 10; 54].
This could explain why the influence of trait anxiety on fear of giving up control is only
evident in the autonomous condition. To validate this assumption with our data, we
subsequently examined how the bus modality affects the relationship between trait anxiety
and fear of giving up control. For transparency of the calculation and results of this
subsequent analysis, the corresponding R code is available in the OSF repository:
the moderation analysis confirmed the previously revealed significant positive influence of
trait anxiety, but not of bus modality, b = 0.07, p = .808, on fear of giving up control. The
moderation by the bus modality missed significance, ab = 0.052, p = .083, possibly due to the
previously discussed sample size. Future studies can take this finding as a starting point to
investigate these relationships in more detail and in larger samples. This may help to
understand whether trait anxiety exerts a greater influence on fear of giving up control in
autonomous buses than in conventional buses. However, it remains open why the trait anxiety
in the autonomous condition does not also have a more substantial effect on the ITU.
Furthermore, contrary to our expectations, more anxious individuals descriptively also
showed a higher fear of giving up control to buses, which had a negative effect on ITU. Thus,
our model includes a positive direct effect and a (non-significant) negative indirect effect in
both conditions (autonomous vs. conventional). Accordingly, although trait anxiety has a
positive direct effect on ITU in the total sample, it has a non-significant negative indirect
effect on ITU via the mediator. This seemingly contradictory phenomenon is known in the
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
mediation analysis literature as the "suppression effect" [41]. The actual effect of trait anxiety
on ITU is thus underestimated because it is dampened by fear of giving up control [41]. In
our study, however, the effect of this suppression is negligible because it only has a slight
effect on the relationships. The opportunity to give up control by Qu et al. [16] is thus not an
explanation for the positive association between trait anxiety and ITU, neither for
autonomous nor for conventional buses.
Nevertheless, it remains open why more anxious individuals reported a higher ITU for
buses. A possible explanation for this is that concerns about the autonomous driving
technology have meanwhile been reduced by the higher availability, e.g., of autonomous
assistance systems, and autonomous as well as conventional buses may even be perceived as
safer than, e.g., driving a vehicle oneself. Cunningham et al. [48] showed that autonomous
driving is associated with higher road safety by more than one-third of people. It may be that
anxious people in particular value the new technology, e.g., because of the higher safety. It
might also be possible that the positive association is due to another common feature of the
buses that has nothing to do with either autonomous technology or control delivery. The
buses in which we surveyed ran on electric propulsion in both conditions. We consciously
decided to have electric buses in the conventional comparison group to ensure comparability
with electric-driving autonomous buses. Some studies provide evidence that higher trait
anxiety is associated with higher concern about climate change [55]. It is possible that,
therefore, more anxious individuals are more likely to prefer public transit, which is
inherently more environmentally friendly than private driving [56]. The electric drive of our
buses may also be perceived more positively in this regard, conditioning the positive
relationship between trait anxiety and ITU. Future work can address our findings and further
examine these and other possible explanations for the positive association between trait
anxiety and ITU. According to our results, the fear of giving up control does not explain the
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
positive association. However, it decreased ITU for conventional buses in a direct way.
Manufacturers and providers of buses can use this as an opportunity to specifically strengthen
the perceived control while riding the bus, e.g., by installing emergency buttons that are
highly visible and that passengers can use to intervene if necessary [57]. In the buses, posters
could provide information about the training path to becoming a bus driver or about the
functioning of the AI to strengthen the trust in its reliability and take away users' fear of
giving up driving control. The challenge of giving up control in AVs could also be explicitly
addressed in the marketing of AVs. Commercials showing people who are quickly convinced
of the benefits of AVs (e.g., driving safety) despite their initial fear of giving up control after
their first experiences could be a promising avenue. Initial fears or uncertainties about giving
up control could thus be normalized, while potential users are encouraged to use AVs at the
same time [58]. Another approach may be to give people the feeling that they have control
over the bus route, e.g., by requesting a bus via an app. These on-demand services are
currently being simulated and tested for several cities, e.g., Hamburg, Germany [59], or
Fuyang, China, [60], and might have a positive impact on the perceived control. Providers
should also emphasize the benefits of buses and inform passengers specifically, e.g.,
opportunities related to driving safety or optimizing traffic flow [61; 11]. It may be the task
of future work to determine which measures are best suited to counteract the fear of giving up
control in buses.
Third, according to the multigroup analysis results, the effects of our mediation model
appeared to be independent of whether control was handed over to the AI (with the assistance
of human operators in critical situations through teleoperation) or a human driver (H3 not
supported). Contrary to earlier assumptions, AV technology did not further increase the
impact of fear of giving up control significantly. This bodes well for the widespread adoption
of autonomous buses, as in our study it seemed irrelevant for ITU whether control was
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
handed over to the AI or a human bus driver. Overall, however, the willingness to use
autonomous buses was still lower than for conventional buses. This result may be due to
disadvantages of autonomous buses that were not considered in this study but have a negative
impact on ITU, e.g., the unfamiliar driving situation or possibly higher infrastructure costs
[62; 3]. For the implementation of AVs, this implies that work still needs to be done to ensure
that autonomous buses are accepted as an alternative or even a substitute for conventional
buses. We need to point out again for the interpretability of this finding that the term
autonomous in our study means that in critical situations, driving control is taken over by an
operator via teleoperation. Fully autonomous vehicles cannot be investigated in real road
traffic at the current state of technological development. There is evidence that fully
autonomous buses, which will be able to drive without teleoperation in the indefinite future,
will be seen even more skeptically because control will be handed over fully to the AI [54].
Assuming this, the focus should be even more on making AVs more attractive to users.
Autonomous buses could, for example, be designed similarly to conventional buses, for
which acceptance is higher, to minimize the first apparent difference. In the marketing of
autonomous buses, more attention should be drawn to the advantages of autonomous buses
over conventional buses. Feedback from potential users should be obtained to find out why
they still show a lower ITU towards autonomous buses, e.g., through surveys among bus
users. This would help to take appropriate precautions and adjustments with regard to
regulations, guidelines, the implementation process, and the provision of autonomous buses.
Limitations and future work
To evaluate the results of our study in a well-founded manner, we would like to point
out some limitations. First, the limited generalizability of our study results based on the
selected sample should be noted. Due to the limited availability of autonomous buses, we
could only collect test subjects for the autonomous bus condition on one autonomous bus
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
route in the city of Regensburg. However, we would not have been able to meet our pre-
specified sample size if we had recruited only natural users of the autonomous bus in
Regensburg because the driving schedule and passenger numbers of the this bus were very
limited. Therefore, the sample of the autonomous condition consisted mainly of students from
the University of Regensburg, who were specifically recruited through a university platform.
This made the sample less variant and limited representativeness in terms of age and
education level, but it also achieved a larger size. In addition, the sample was not balanced
with respect to gender, resulting in a higher proportion of women in our study. There were
significant differences in trait anxiety and fear of giving up control that could possibly be
related to gender or age effects [63–65]. This made it difficult for us to compare the two
conditions with regard to the influence of trait anxiety. Furthermore, sociodemographic
factors, e.g., gender, age, education, or socioeconomic status, may directly influence the ITU
of AVs [66; 67; 57]. In our study, ITU was largely independent of gender and age.
Nevertheless, we recommend that the sociodemographic generalizability of our findings be
tested at a later point in time when autonomous buses are widely available and that the study
also be replicated with a focus on other (e.g., older) populations. Under these conditions, the
results should also be examined within a larger sample. Within the project period, it was not
possible to expand the sample due to the limited availability of autonomous buses. Future
studies may address our findings and replicate them in larger samples once autonomous buses
are widely implemented. This could reveal effects that may not have been evident in our
study due to the limited sample size [49].
Furthermore, we need to consider the limitations of our survey situation. The
autonomous buses in which the study data of the autonomous condition were collected are
currently driving in the industrial park of Regensburg on a ring-shaped route. The
autonomous bus reaches a maximum speed of 18 km/h and is thus slower than the
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
conventional buses in the comparison condition. This could potentially lead to a perception of
the trip being less time efficient, which could negatively affect ITU. Furthermore,
autonomous buses are not yet technically capable of driving fully autonomously on public
roads. For critical situations, so-called operators are needed via teleoperation who take over
driving monitoring systematically. One limitation of our study is that we do not know
whether the participants thought they were handing over driving control completely to the AI
or whether they were aware that an operator could take over driving control in a critical
situation. This might have influenced their attitude towards giving up control. The possibility
of the control transfer to the operator in an emergency may be one reason why the mediation
model in the autonomous condition did not differ from that in the conventional condition. In
case future studies cannot be conducted in fully autonomous buses, it should at least be
monitored whether the users were aware of the human operator taking over control in an
emergency or perceived the vehicle as fully autonomous. Another limitation is the
inconsistent reference framework of different anxiety questionnaires. For better
comparability, we surveyed trait anxiety with the same inventory already used by Qu et al.
[16]: the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [68]. The inventory is established worldwide, and its
psychometric quality and validity were confirmed many times, e.g., [69; 70]. However, as
noted by Qu et al., [16] the results depend on what the anxiety refers to in the wording of the
items. Qu et al. [16] cite as an example a study by Hohenberger et al. [15], in which anxiety
negatively affected the ITU of AVs. In this study, the anxiety items primarily related to
anxiety about making mistakes when interacting with AVs (e.g., I would be afraid that I
could cause (e.g., by pushing a button) a malfunction (e.g., emergency brake) by using an
[semi-] automated car., [15, p. 10]). In contrast, the items of the State-Trait Anxiety
Inventory used by Qu et al. [16] refer more to general inadequacies of oneself in the context
of trait anxiety (e.g., I don't have self-confidence., translated from German, [29, p. 2]). Thus,
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
while the items of Hohenberger et al. [15] directed the focus to anxiety in dealing with AVs,
we possibly addressed general self-related anxiety in our study [16]. According to Qu et al.
[16], this may be one reason why anxiety (focusing on AVs) negatively affected ITU in the
study of Hohenberger et al. [15]. In contrast, in the study of Qu et al. [16] as well as in our
study, individuals with high (self-focused) anxiety were more open to AVs. Among other
reasons, this may be because potential risks and dangers related to AVs (unlike in the study
of Hohenberger et al. [15]) were not explicitly addressed and thus less anxiety was raised
among the subjects.
Furthermore, the general characteristics of mediation analysis must be considered. We
found in our study that the effect of trait anxiety on ITU was slightly partially suppressed by
fear of giving up control. The actual magnitude of the influence was revealed only when the
mediator variable was included. However, it is unlikely that the fear of giving up control is
the only mediator of this relationship. Thus, other mediators may exist that mediate the
association between trait anxiety and ITU, both reinforcing and suppressing [41]. For
example, as discussed in the section above, higher trait anxiety could lead to higher climate
change anxiety, thereby increasing the propensity to use public, electric, and efficient
vehicles. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the actual association is even stronger than we
currently found [41]. This is a well-known general limitation of mediation analysis [41]. We
can only progressively confirm the true role of our mediator by further understanding the
relationship between trait anxiety and ITU, thereby ruling out the influence of possible
confounding mediators. This may be the task of future research in this field.
Conclusion
The present study on the acceptance of AVs aimed to understand the influence of trait
anxiety on ITU in greater detail by focusing on the fear of giving up control. Trait anxiety
TRAIT ANXIETY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES
positively affected ITU in general, but the association only reached significance when the
total sample was considered. The mediation by fear of giving up control was in our study not
the positive direction of the relationship. Surprisingly, these results appeared independent of
whether control was given to an AI in the autonomous bus or a human driver in the
conventional bus in a direct statistical model comparison. The finding that AVs and public
transport, are attractive transport concepts, particularly for anxious people, suggests that there
may already be widespread awareness in the population of the benefits of autonomous,
sustainable, and efficient transport concepts. It may be the task of future research to further
investigate the underlying mechanisms of action that condition the relationship between trait
anxiety and ITU.
