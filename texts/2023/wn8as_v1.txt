NARRATIVE COMPREHENSION
Abstract
Background: Understanding narratives is essential for societal participation. However, insufficient
literacy or age-related cognitive changes can limit narrative comprehension and create participation
barriers.
Aims: This study investigates the potential of pictorial narratives to convey information beyond text and
break down barriers to comprehension.
Sample: A representative adult sample (N = 1487).
Methods: The experimental study assessed the influences of age and education on the comprehension of
textual and pictorial narratives. Participants were tested on the generation of bridging inferences, a
central aspect of narrative comprehension. The narratives used were based on the "Multilingual
Assessment Instrument for Narratives" (MAIN), and comprehension was measured through a task where
participants identified correct and false inference statements related to missing parts of the narratives.
Results: Narrative comprehension was higher within higher educated groups and stable across the
measured adult age span. Comprehension was generally better for pictorial narratives than textual ones
across all education and age groups. Frequentist and Bayesian analyses supported these findings,
showing significant effects of education and narrative codality on comprehension but no interaction
between these factors.
Conclusions: The findings lay the groundwork for more effectively addressing minoritized groups and
refining theories on narrative comprehension. The results suggest that pictorial narratives could be a
valuable approach to enhance comprehension and participation for individuals with literacy challenges
or cognitive changes due to aging. This study also emphasizes the role of education in narrative
comprehension and suggests stable comprehension abilities across the adult age span.

NARRATIVE COMPREHENSION
Education, Not Age, Linked to Narrative Comprehension
Comprehending narratives is a crucial life skill. It is needed to follow simple entertainment such
as films, to follow described safety procedures, or go vote, to name some. This skill is thus essential to
partake in society, acquire education, and master daily life challenges as it grants access to all forms of
information. Because text is still a prevalent way of providing information, this access often requires
proficient literacy and language skills, and it can also be subject to change throughout one's life.
In 2022, 13% of the world population above 15 years was still considered illiterate (World Bank
Open Data, 2024), and even in highly industrialized countries such as Germany, 12.1% of the adult
population in 2018 belonged to the group of low literates (Grotlüschen et al., 2019). This makes low
literacy and aging associated with changes in cognitive abilities (Salthouse, 1996; Salthouse & Babcock,
1991; Salthouse & Ferrer-Caja, 2003) significant societal challenges. Especially lower education and
higher age groups are prevalent among low literates, who are characterized by difficulties in
comprehending textual narratives of higher complexity than single sentences (Grotlüschen et al., 2019;
Vágvölgyi et al., 2016) and are thus at risk of being left out. Further barriers to societal participation are
created by increasingly multicultural and multilingual societies with high variability in the specific
language skills needed for comprehending textual narratives in the official language. Acquiring those
skills is also tied to having access to education (Grotlüschen et al., 2019; Schröter & Bar-Kochva, 2019).
Aging societies also demand answers to the question of how age changes narrative understanding and
comprehension processes, as previous research reports declining of some comprehension processes (Noh
& Stine-Morrow, 2009) as well as some aspects of narrative understanding being preserved (Magliano et
al., 2012; Radvansky & Dijkstra, 2007a) with increasing age. To increase the opportunities for
participation, access to information could also be made possible in other codalities than text, such as
pictograms or comics, conveying information pictorially without or only minimally relying on language.
Note that in the present project, we adopt the term codality based on the distinction between modality
and codality of information (Clark & Salomon, 1986). Codality refers to information coding as pictorial,
verbal, or symbolic (Huff et al., 2020) while modality pertains to the sensory channel through which
information is perceived (e.g., visual, auditory). Whether discrepancies and changes in narrative
comprehension associated with aging and education impact narratives of all codalities equally is one
NARRATIVE COMPREHENSION
core question relevant to this approach. So far, narrative comprehension processes, like event model
construction or inference generation, have been researched in text (Graesser et al., 1994; Radvansky &
Copeland, 2010), dynamic (audio-)visual media like films (Huff et al., 2014; Magliano & Zacks, 2011),
or auditive narratives (Huff et al., 2018). This research finds many similarities in narrative
comprehension processes across various mediums and codalities (Gernsbacher et al., 1990; Magliano et
al., 2012; Meitz et al., 2020). However, despite being increasingly common and harboring great
potential to convey information, research on pictorial narratives (e.g., comics) is still emerging (Cohn &
Magliano, 2020). In psychological research, there is still no satisfactory answer to whether there is an
alignment between the comprehension processes for pictorial narratives and other forms of narratives.
Recently, however, linguistic research developed the multidimensional model of narrative organization,
a framework for analyzing narrative structures, to delve into the understanding of storytelling through
pictures in over several dozen languages (Bohnacker & Gagarina, 2020). The results demonstrate the
universal structure of a narrative and its transfer between bilinguals' two languages. They also show that
comprehension of picture-based narratives develops extensively in children from age 4 to age 6‒7 and
with a plateau afterward.
To effectively utilize pictorial narratives, it is essential to study their comprehension processes
and influencing factors. There is a notable gap in research regarding how narrative understanding varies
across different ages, educational backgrounds, and codalities. We aim to fill this gap and broaden our
understanding of comprehension processes for pictorial narratives for different age and education groups
in a large representative German sample.
Comprehending narrated content engages a multitude of cognitive processes working to build a
coherent mental representation. This involves building a mental model and constantly updating it with
the unfolding plot as well as bridging the gaps between explicitly depicted parts of the narrative
(Bohnacker & Gagarina, 2020; Brich et al., 2024; Gernsbacher, 1997; Graesser et al., 1994; Loschky et
al., 2020; Zacks, 2020). This mental or event model is stored and accessed in working memory (Zacks,
2020). The structure building framework (Gernsbacher, 1997; Gernsbacher et al., 1990) postulates three
processes for building mental models of a narrative: laying a foundation containing the information
within a scene, continually mapping new information onto the preexisting model, and, if new
information is largely inconsistent with the current model, shifting to a new foundation. The mapping
NARRATIVE COMPREHENSION
process makes use of inference generation processes that bridge the gaps between explicitly depicted
narrative scenes to maintain the coherence of the mental model (Graesser et al., 1994; Hutson et al.,
2018; Loschky et al., 2020; Magliano et al., 2016).
These three processes reflect a general comprehension skill applicable to both written and
pictorial narratives (Gernsbacher et al., 1990), suggesting that individuals who are good comprehenders
should excel with both text and wordless comics, whereas those with comprehension deficits would
struggle with all narrative forms. Education may enhance this general comprehension skill by providing
extensive practice with complex texts and visual materials, fostering inference-making and mental
model construction abilities (Cunningham & Stanovich, 1998; Ericsson & Kintsch, 1995). Additionally,
interindividual differences in cognitive ability, such as general intelligence, may contribute to the link
between education and comprehension, as individuals with higher education typically have stronger
cognitive skills that aid in narrative understanding (Ackerman & Rolfhus, 1999). Studies like Magliano
et al. (2012) found similar comprehension results for textual and pictorial narratives, indicating
consistent event segmentation skills. However, recent findings (Cohn, 2020; Huff et al., 2020) suggest
that narrative codality does affect comprehension. For instance, generating bridging events in comics
was more challenging when text replaced images (Huff et al., 2020), highlighting that comprehension
efforts vary with the format. This aligns with Cohn’s view that visual language, like verbal language,
requires practice and exposure, for instance, participants from rural areas, who had little exposure to
visual narratives (i.e., comics or picture books), frequently struggled to understand referential continuity
in sequential narratives. This suggests that educational experiences may support not only textual literacy
but also the comprehension of pictorial narratives, as it involves exposure and practice with a graphic
system. Thus, just as textual literacy is linked to educational level (Grotlüschen et al., 2019; Schröter &
Bar-Kochva, 2019), pictorial narrative comprehension may similarly benefit from educational exposure.
The reviewed theoretical and empirical evidence does not provide a clear picture of the effects
of codality on narrative comprehension. Thus far, a large body of the reviewed literature points to
comprehension similarities rather than differences between narrative codalities (Gernsbacher et al.,
1990; Magliano et al., 2012; Meitz et al., 2020). However, empirical studies directly comparing the
comprehension of different codalities and exploring the educational ties of pictorial narratives (in
representative samples) are still lacking.
NARRATIVE COMPREHENSION
The trajectory of narrative comprehension processes across the lifespan suggests an age-related
decline, especially as working memory plays a central role in constructing a mental model of a narrative
(Zacks, 2020). Research indicates that working memory resources are essential for bridging inference
generation during comprehension, a process necessary to connect narrative parts (Magliano et al., 2016).
However, many working memory-related cognitive abilities are known to decrease with age (Salthouse
& Babcock, 1991; Salthouse & Ferrer-Caja, 2003), suggesting that narrative comprehension processes
dependent on these resources are likely to decline as well. Although some studies report stability in the
situation model level of comprehension, such stability appears limited to text-based narratives and may
not extend to all forms of narratives (Radvansky & Dijkstra, 2007b). Indeed, challenges in narrative
comprehension become more apparent in older adults, particularly in tasks requiring the tracking of
multiple characters or complex events, highlighting potential working memory limitations (Noh &
Stine-Morrow, 2009). Furthermore, declines in the hierarchical organization of ongoing activity
observations with age (Kurby & Zacks, 2011) suggest that narrative comprehension, especially in
complex or dynamic scenarios, is likely impacted as individuals grow older.
Present Study
We derived three hypotheses to study how narrative comprehension is influenced by education
and age, and, most importantly, whether the notion of a general comprehension skill holds true across
representative age and education groups or if there is a difference in the comprehension of narrative
codalities (pictorial or textual) that might vary with education or age. More specifically, we expected
narrative comprehension to increase with higher education (H1) (Grotlüschen et al., 2019; Schröter &
Bar-Kochva, 2019) and to decrease with higher age (H2) (Noh & Stine-Morrow, 2009). Additionally,
considering the concept of the general comprehension skill (Gernsbacher et al., 1990) and the body of
evidence pointing to similarities in the comprehension processes between narrative codalitites, we
expected no difference in the comprehension of different narrative codalities (i.e. textual, pictorial) and
consequently no interaction of the narrative’s codality and the participants’ education level or age (H3).
We developed a task suitable to measure narrative comprehension in a large online setting by
assessing bridging inference generation in short textual and pictorial stories (see Appendix A for a
description of a material test). The bridging event of the stories was missing and had to be inferred for
comprehension (Huff et al., 2020; Magliano et al., 2016). To assess the generation of bridging
NARRATIVE COMPREHENSION
inferences, participants were shown a statement after reading a story and asked to determine whether it
accurately reflected the story.
Methods
experiment was approved by the ethics committee of the ANONYMIZED.
Participants
A sample of N = 1563 German-speaking participants (who gave consent and did not withdraw
their data) was recruited through the online-panel provider respondi. This sample was a representative
quota sample for the German population above 18 years regarding age, education (based on the highest
German school degree), and gender. As preregistered, we excluded all participants with a completion
time below 3 and above 26 minutes (73 exclusions). Additionally, we excluded 3 participants due to
stating an age below 18. The final sample consisted of N = 1487 participants (2 non-binary, 757 male,
and 728 female participants). Mean age was M = 47.00 years (SD = 16.16) ranging from 18 to 87 years.
Design
The study followed a 3 education (low, middle, high; between-subjects) x age (continuous;
between-subjects) x 2 codality (text, picture; within-subjects) design.
Apparatus and Material
Narratives. We use the four stories from the "Multilingual Assessment Instrument for Narratives
– Revised" (MAIN) (Gagarina et al., 2012, 2019) as stimulus material. MAIN is based on the theoretical
model of multidimensional story organization, a framework for analyzing narrative skills across several
dimensions to understand how individuals structure and convey stories. While theory-based pictorial
stimuli were originally created for children, the instrument has been used with adults (Gagarina et al.,
2019; Özsoy et al., 2023). The stories contained narratives about children and animals interacting with
each other or their environment (Gagarina, 2021). Each story contains six pictures representing three
different episodes, which could unfold partially in parallel, and exists as a pictorial and textual version.
We thus extracted one clip for each episode (a total of 12) from both the textual and pictorial story
versions, resulting in 24 narrative story clips (12 pictorial and 12 textual). Each pictorial clip consisted
of three panels, while the textual versions were split up into passages/sentences corresponding to each
NARRATIVE COMPREHENSION
panel in the picture story. To research bridging inference generation, each clip's middle panel/segment
panels/segments simultaneously arranged from left to right during the stimulus presentation. Due to the
overlap of some of the episodes, only 8 of the 12 episode clips could be presented to one participant;
half of them were presented as pictures, half as text. All pictorial clips were presented for 9 seconds,
based on the panel viewing times in (see Appendix A for a material test). We calculated the presentation
time for each textual clip individually based on its number of words. Calculations were based on an
average silent reading rate of 260 words per minute in German (Brysbaert, 2019). Textual clip viewing
time thus resulted from the respective number of words read in an average reading time and an
additional 3 seconds for the empty frame. Presentation times for textual clips ranged from 13 to 21
seconds.
For the assessment of bridging inference generation, each clip was paired with either a true or a
false inference statement regarding the blank frame. The inference statements were always one textual
sentence stating what happened in the empty frame (e.g., "The boy gave sausages to the dog."). Each
participant received 2 false and 2 true inferences for each of the 4 textual and pictorial story clips. The
selection of the 8 clips, their codality (text/picture), and the combination with true/false inferences was
counterbalanced across participants (one of the 256 possible combinations was randomly selected for
each participant).
NARRATIVE COMPREHENSION
Experimental procedure and example of the used pictorial and textual story clips generated from the
MAIN (Gagarina et al., 2019). Each clip had three panels of which the middle bridging event was
omitted during presentation and had to be inferred for comprehension. On the following screen the
corresponding correct or false inference statement was presented. The presentation duration of the clip
depicted here refers to the main experiment (in black) or to the material test (in orange).
Narrative comprehension - Bridging inference task. We measured the main dependent
variable, narrative comprehension in the bridging inference task as the correct identification of correct
(describing the narratively correct inference for the missing bridging event) and false (describing the
narratively false inference for the missing bridging event) inference statements (incorrect answer = 0,
correct answer = 1). Each true or false textual inference statement participants were presented with was
preceded by the following sentence "the following happened in the empty frame:" and was followed
with "Is this correct or false?". Participants answered "correct" or "false" and had to rate their confidence
in this answer ("How confident are you in your answer?") on a 6-point scale from 1 = "very unsure" to 6
= "very sure". The confidence measures were not considered in the current manuscript.
Age. We preregistered age to be treated as a continuous variable, which we centered prior to
analysis.
Educational background. We assessed the educational background with two questions
generated to cover educational classifications by the ISCED 1997 (Organisation for Economic Co-
NARRATIVE COMPREHENSION
operation and Development (OECD), 1999; Simonson & Hameister, 2017) for the German education
system. We grouped education into the three categories: low (n = 489), middle (n = 475), and high (n =
523), based on the question about highest school education. The low classification contained answer
options 1-3, the middle category entailed the option "Realschulabschluss […]", and the high level
encompassed the remaining options (see Appendix A for details). Professional education was not
considered in the current manuscript.
Programming. The experiment was programmed and hosted with SoSciSurvey as an online
study.
Procedure
Participants started the study by giving informed consent and providing demographic
information (the also assessed comic and reading experience and self-reported reading ability were not
considered in the current manuscript). Subsequently, they were instructed that they would see short
snippets of picture or text stories presented in three panels and that a part of the story was missing
missing story parts afterward. Instructions stated that participants would be automatically forwarded
after 9 seconds in the picture condition and a varying presentation duration in the text condition.
Participants started with four practice trials (two text and two picture clips, with one false and true
inference each) during which they first saw a story clip, then had to rate a corresponding inference
statement as correct or false and rate their confidence in the bridging inference task on the following
page. They received feedback about the correct answers during the trial phase but not in the
experimental trials. Before the eight experimental trials started, the instructions were repeated. Each trial
followed the same pattern: participants saw a short story clip on the first page. On the second page,
participants were presented with the bridging inference task for the respective story without any time
limit. With “next”, they could proceed to the next clip after answering both questions. At the end of the
experiment, participants could retract their data and afterward were redirected to a website to receive
compensation. The duration of the experiment was 10 to 15 minutes (see Appendix A for the questions
used).
Results
NARRATIVE COMPREHENSION
Our analysis strategy was two-fold. (1) For the preregistered frequentist analysis, we fitted for
the binomial narrative comprehension variable generalized linear mixed-effects models (glmer) of the
logit-family (lme4-package) (Bates et al., 2015) for logistic regression, with random intercepts for
participants and clips. (2) Bayesian statistics enables explicit testing of the null hypothesis,
complementing the frequentist approach effectively. We followed Jeffreys’ (1961) heuristic: Bayes
Factors (BF) between 1-3 are anecdotal, 3-10 substantial, 10-30 strong, 30-100 very strong, and BFs
>100 extreme evidence for the alternative hypothesis. Fractions (1/3, 1/10, etc.) represent evidence
strength for the null hypothesis (see Appendix B for an extended version of the Bayesian analysis
including posterior predictive checks).
Narrative comprehension and education
Frequentist analysis
Starting from an intercept model, the fixed effects of education, codality, and their interaction
were sequentially added and compared. Confirming H1, narrative comprehension increased from low to
high education, χ (2) = 57.89, p < .001. Contrary to H3, narrative comprehension was higher in the
picture than in the text codality, χ (1) = 5.97, p = .015. But as expected, the interaction of both factors
was not significant, χ (2) = 3.12, p = .210, thus providing tentative partial evidence for H3. Taken
together, narrative comprehension increased from low to high education independent of codality, while
Bayesian analysis
We used Bayesian analysis securing the results of the frequentist analysis. We fitted the same
models (including education and codality as fixed effects and participant and item as random intercepts)
using the brms-package for R (Bürkner, 2017). As prior distributions, we chose normal(0,1) for the
parameter classes b, Intercept, and exponential(10) for SD. The selected prior distributions are weakly
informative and constrain the parameter space by giving a low probability to extreme values. In the first
step, we compare the main effects model (including the main effects only) to the full model (including
the interaction) using BF, thus explicitly testing for the interaction term. Running 20 unseeded
5 2 6
computations of both models, the mean BF is 1.97 x 10 (range = 3.66 x 10 - 3.32 x 10 ). This can be
considered extreme evidence in favor of the main effect model and H3, consequently, assuming no

confirms the results of the frequentist analysis. Performance increased with education (conforming H1)
and is lower in the text than the picture condition (non-conforming H3).

including codality as a main effect. The mean BF of this codality-only model over the main effects

Exploratory analyses: Influence of reading experience on narrative comprehension
We assessed reading experience using the variables youth text reading experience, current text
reading experience, youth comic reading experience, and current comic reading experience. We
calculated separate correlations between each of these variables and narrative comprehension. We,
therefore, aggregated the data on the participant level. While the quantile-quantile plot analyses of youth
and current text reading experience as well as youth comic reading experience showed that its
distribution. Only a few participants reported having moderate or high current comic reading experience,
thus leading to a highly skewed distribution. We, therefore, refrained from analyzing the current comic
reading experience variable.
Spearman correlation analyses showed that youth text reading experience positively and
significantly correlated with narrative comprehension (ρ = .10, p < .001). Both correlations of current
text reading experience and narrative comprehension (ρ = .05, p = .068) and of youth comic reading
experience and narrative comprehension (ρ = -0.02, p = .512) were not significant.

Discussion
Our findings reveal three key insights: First, higher education levels correlate with higher
narrative comprehension for both text and images. Second, narrative comprehension remains consistent
across the measured ages. Third, pictorial narratives are generally better understood than textual ones
across all demographics. These results, largely unexpected except for the educational impact, highlight
the potential of pictorial narratives to enhance comprehension and accessibility in diverse populations.
Our data confirms that, similar to textual literacy (Grotlüschen et al., 2019; Schröter & Bar-
Kochva, 2019), pictorial narrative comprehension is associated with education levels. Higher education
correlates with better comprehension of both textual and pictorial narratives, emphasizing the role of
quality education in developing diverse life skills. The absence of the interaction of education and
narrative codality suggests that targeting less educated groups with pictorial narratives may not be
particularly effective. However, since pictorial stories enhance comprehension across all education
levels, they could still be a viable method to engage these groups more effectively.
Contrary to expectations, the ability to identify bridging inferences for story comprehension did
not decline with age, aligning with mixed findings on age-related comprehension effects, with some
studies noting declines (Noh & Stine-Morrow, 2009) and others showing preserved abilities (Magliano
NARRATIVE COMPREHENSION
et al., 2012; Radvansky & Dijkstra, 2007a). This suggests that bridging inferences may be a narrative
comprehension process that remains stable with age (Varkentin et al., 2024), possibly due to cognitive
independence or compensatory mechanisms (Radvansky & Dijkstra, 2007a). Given the stability in
adulthood and the developmental importance of narrative comprehension skills in childhood and youth
(Bohnacker & Gagarina, 2020; Collins et al., 1978; Lynch et al., 2008), future studies should include
younger individuals to explore the effects of narrative codality on developing comprehension skills.
Hypothesis 3, based on the idea of a general comprehension skill (Gernsbacher et al., 1990), was
only partially supported. Age and education did not affect the impact of narrative codality on
comprehension, supporting the notion of codality-independent comprehension processes. However,
comprehension was higher for pictorial than textual narratives, challenging this idea. This discrepancy
suggests that differences in comprehension might stem from varying difficulty levels in material or
execution rather than different cognitive processes. According to the structure building framework
(Gernsbacher, 1997; Gernsbacher et al., 1990), processes such as laying a foundation, mapping, and
switching may require less effort for pictorial narratives, thus enhancing comprehension across all
demographics. Moreover, the design of the MAIN narratives used, which are tailored for clarity and
universal appeal, may particularly facilitate the understanding of pictorial narratives (Gagarina et al.,
2019). Considering these findings, future research should also examine cognitive and executive factors
or measure cognitive load to further clarify narrative comprehension dynamics.
Our exploratory analyses on the role of reading experience in narrative comprehension suggest
that early exposure to text reading may play a modest yet significant role in supporting narrative
comprehension skills. Specifically, we found a positive correlation between youth text reading
experience and comprehension performance, indicating that early engagement with text-based narratives
could contribute to the development of inference-making skills that are beneficial for understanding
narratives across formats. In contrast, both current text reading experience and youth comic reading
experience showed no significant correlation with comprehension scores. This suggests that text reading
during formative years may be more influential for building foundational comprehension abilities than
reading habits in later years or early comic exposure. Importantly, current comic reading experience was
excluded from the analysis due to a highly skewed distribution, as most participants reported little to no
engagement with comics in adulthood. This skew limited our ability to examine its potential effects,
NARRATIVE COMPREHENSION
highlighting a broader trend in reading preferences that may warrant further investigation. While these
results are correlational and do not imply causation, they underscore the potential value of sustained,
early exposure to text narratives in developing comprehension skills that extend across different
narrative modalities. Future studies should further investigate how specific types of reading experiences,
especially in early life, might shape narrative comprehension and whether similar effects can be found
with other forms of visual narratives.
We attempted to mitigate differences in difficulty between pictorial and textual versions of the
same narrative by using well-researched material from the MAIN project (Gagarina et al., 2019), which
aligns pictures and texts based on cognitive complexity and episodic structure. Despite these efforts,
creating equivalent text and picture versions remains challenging. The cross-sectional nature of our
study limits interpretations of causality and may overlook cohort effects, suggesting the need for
longitudinal research to confirm our findings.
Our study carefully calibrated the complexity of the narrative materials to ensure they would
challenge comprehension processes without introducing ceiling effects. A pilot study, detailed in the
Appendix, guided these adjustments, and using the MAIN ensured the materials remained valid and
appropriate for adult populations (Sekerina et al., 2025). While our findings show stable comprehension
across age groups, future research should further explore how working memory capacity interacts with
narrative complexity, particularly in older adults. Prior work (e.g., Magliano et al., 2016) highlights the
role of bridging inference generation in narrative comprehension, emphasizing the need for studies that
systematically vary narrative complexity to assess its impact on working memory capacity and
comprehension across the lifespan.
Our study provides a nuanced look at how age, educational level, and narrative codality
influence narrative comprehension. By examining these factors in a large, representative sample and
using a preregistered framework, we highlight that educational level, not age, is the primary factor
associated with comprehension across both textual and pictorial narratives. This finding emphasizes
education’s unique role in supporting comprehension across formats. Through both frequentist and
Bayesian analyses, we offer robust evidence for these insights, enriching our understanding of how
demographic factors shape narrative comprehension. Importantly, our results demonstrate a remarkable
stability in comprehension across age groups, suggesting that narrative comprehension skills remain

resilient over time. Pictorial narratives, we found, enhance comprehension across all age and education
levels while maintaining the same dependency on educational background as textual narratives. This
stability across age groups holds significant implications for supporting disadvantaged populations and
advancing equity in comprehension. Expanding the primary task of our research—bridging inference
generation—into a psychological test could provide a valuable tool for assessing multimodal inference
abilities across diverse demographics. Such an expansion could inform future theories on narrative
organization and refine models of narrative skills, particularly in older adults. While narrative
comprehension reflects a general comprehension skill (Gernsbacher, 1997), our findings underscore the
importance of considering both age and educational influences to fully understand comprehension across
codalities.
