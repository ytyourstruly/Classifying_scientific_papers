Safeguarding Cognitive Well-being in an AI-Augmented World: A Socio-Technical
Systems Perspective on Neuroethics, Technostress, and Risk Management
Benjamin Kereopa-Yorke, MCybSec
Abstract: This paper undertakes a comprehensive examination of artificial intelligence (AI)
integration in the workplace, adopting a multidisciplinary perspective spanning technology,
commerce, psychology and ethics. It grapples with the opportunities AI presents for
augmenting productivity as well as emergent risks like erosion of creativity, blind obedience
to algorithms and widening disparities.
The study is structured around key themes that underscore AI's multifaceted impact: (1) The
transformative effect of AI on workplace dynamics, workflows and decision-making
processes; (2) The critical role of cognitive ergonomics in designing AI tools that align with
rather than overburden human cognitive capabilities; (3) Insights from neuroscience revealing
how human cognition adapts to AI collaboration; (4) Potential biases and transparency issues
with enterprise AI systems that necessitate ethical oversight.
Additionally, the research delves into the altered cyber risk landscape with AI integration,
highlighting new attack vectors targeting employee behaviour and AI itself. It emphasises
cybersecurity strategies focused on resilience.
The paper advocates for a balanced approach when embedding AI in workplaces, one that
harnesses technological capabilities but also actively fosters human skills, psychological
wellness and ethical assurance. This requires evolving supportive organisational cultures and
leadership approaches that consciously guide AI adoption to augment rather than displace
human potential. The research aims to provide multidimensional, multidisciplinary
perspectives guiding policymakers and executives towards responsible AI assimilation
improving productivity without compromising ethics or human welfare.
