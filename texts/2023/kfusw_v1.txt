Abstract
Everyday life often requires us to switch between states of cognitive flexibility and stability.
However, little is yet known about what drives their regulation at the meta-control level.
Based on current theories on cognitive control, we tested whether the regulation of cognitive
flexibility and stability is guided by reinforcement learning. Using a task switching paradigm
with double registration procedure – where people need to choose which task to perform
before seeing the target, we systematically reinforced cued task switches or repetitions to test
whether this led to more voluntary task switching (flexibility) or repeating (stability) on
interspersed unrewarded free choice trials, respectively. While we did not find the
hypothesized effect in an uninstructed version of the experiment (n=97), informing
participants (n=58) on the reinforcement schedule on cued trials induced more switching or
repeating on unrewarded free choice trials. We speculate that people adapt their control
strategies if they are aware of the respective benefits, even when they cease to be rewarded.
Interestingly, choices were predominantly driven by task preference in both experiments and
strongly correlated with task performance costs. This finding suggests that, when using an
interspersed design with double registration procedure, people mostly choose tasks based on
task difficulty rather than switch avoidance. Together, these experiments help determine
whether and when people can learn about the value of task selection strategies beyond the
scope of a single task, and provide a self-regulating system to understand putative higher-
order control processes.

Introduction
In our daily lives, we often need to switch between different tasks such as checking
our e-mails and reading a document, thus requiring a certain level of cognitive flexibility.
However, sometimes it is more beneficial to focus on a single task, and we should apply a
less flexible, but more stable cognitive strategy, e.g., to better shield from interfering
information. This regulation of the trade-off between cognitive flexibility and cognitive
stability is important, as both control modes guide adaptive behaviour depending on the
context (Braem & Egner, 2018; Brosowsky & Egner, 2021; Cohen et al., 2007; Diamond,
2013; Dreisbach & Fröber, 2019; Egner, 2023; Goschke & Bolte, 2014; Xu et al., 2023). In
this study, we aimed to test if people learn to be more flexible (stable) when cognitive
flexibility (stability) is selectively reinforced.
Research has shown that different types of prospective or immediate reward affect
how cognitively flexible we are on a given or subsequent trial (Fröber et al., 2019; Fröber &
Dreisbach, 2014, 2016; Jurczyk et al., 2019; Notebaert & Braem, 2015; Padmala & Pessoa,
2011), or that reward anticipation affects control processes more generally (Botvinick &
Braver, 2015; Kostandyan et al., 2019; Krebs et al., 2010; Locke & Braver, 2008). Yet, the
question of reinforcement of cognitive flexibility is rooted in an emerging learning
perspective on cognitive control which focusses on the learning from reward history over a
longer time (retrospectively). This overarching framework postulates that abstract cognitive
functions are guided by similar learning principles as presumably lower level stimulus
response mappings, replacing the homunculus problem with an empirical alternative
(Abrahamse et al., 2016; Braem & Egner, 2018; Chiu & Egner, 2019; Doebel, 2020; Lieder et
al., 2018; Logan, 1988; Verbruggen et al., 2014).
In a previous study, Braem (2017) showed that selective reinforcement of task
switching in blocks of cued trials led to significantly more voluntary task switching in blocks
of (unrewarded) free choice trials - which is an indicator of learned cognitive flexibility.
Moreover, the group rewarded more on task switches showed smaller task rule congruency
effects, potentially reflecting more task shielding (Musslick & Cohen, 2021). Task rule
congruency effects arise when a stimulus elicits different (incongruent) versus similar
(congruent) responses across tasks and is measured as respective differences in accuracy or
reaction times.
In this study, we aimed to investigate whether these findings could be extended to a
design with a number of motivated modifications. Specifically, the original study allowed
participants to plan longer sequences of tasks by making use of a blocked design, where
blocks of forty cued trials were alternated with blocks of forty voluntary trials. This might be
less indicative of a true and spontaneous voluntary task switch rate (VSR). Moreover, the
original design has “coin flip instructions” (Arrington & Logan, 2004), where people are
instructed to choose the next trial as if determined by a coin toss. Arguably, this voluntary
switch rate can be interpretated as a measure of how much one tends to deviate from (the coin
toss) instructions rather than cognitive flexibility. Therefore, we aimed to use a design where
the free choice trials are interspersed between cued trials which can provide a measure of
cognitive flexibility without additional instructions to “act randomly” (see also Fröber &
Dreisbach, 2017), while discouraging the planning of extended task sequences.
Another limitation of Braem (2017) was that task choice needed to be inferred based
on two separate pairs of response keys for either task which did not allow the separation of
choice related processes from task execution. Therefore, we replaced the task cue screen of
Braem (2017) with a task activation screen, where participants “activate” a given task
through a button press (Fröber et al., 2019) and subsequently use shared response keys for
both tasks. This potentially strengthens congruency effects because of the additional overlap
between task sets. In line with Braem’s results (2017), we predicted that rewarding
participants more often with high reward on task alternations would lead to larger VSR on
interspersed free choice trials and larger congruency effects, i.e., larger relative differences in
reaction time (RT) and accuracy between stimuli requiring the same or other response
(relative to participants rewarded more often with high reward on task repetitions).
Experiment 1
Methods
Participants
This study was approved by the Ghent University Psychology and Educational Sciences
Ethical Committee and participants gave informed consent prior to participation. Sample size
was determined based on a power analysis using simr (Green & MacLeod, 2016; and lme4 for
compatibility with simr) and fitting the model to Braem’s data (2017). Using the original
sample size (19 per group), we achieved good power (around 80 %) for the effect size of the
main effect group on the voluntary switch rate (odds ratio of 1.3). Due to the major
modifications to the design and as a more conservative default criterion, we aimed for a final
sample size of 50 participants per group. To this end, 107 participants were recruited from the
University’s recruitment platform and compensated for their participation with course credit.
The two highest scoring participants (one per group) were additionally rewarded with a 50
Euro gift card. Of the participants, most (82%) were between 18-35 years old, 87% right handed
and 97% female1. Based on our preregistered inclusion criteria, seven participants had to be
1 Due to a mistake, demographic data was not registered in the first experiment which is why demographics had
to be inferred retrospectively via the recruitment system. This allowed us to group them into different age ranges
but does not allow to specify their exact age.
excluded based on too low accuracy and three due to a too low baseline VSR (see pre-
processing), resulting in a final sample of 97 participants (49 in the switch group).
Materials
The experiment was programmed in JsPsych (de Leeuw, 2015). Stimuli consisted of
400 unique Dutch words that can be categorized both according to their size and animacy,
presented in white (30px Verdana) on a black background. They were adapted from Schneider
(2015) and Braem (2017), and extended by 80 novel items, selected from a Dutch database
(Keuleers et al., 2010) to match them in frequency and length per word category (e.g., small
and animate, large and animate (see also Held et al., 2023). We included the same number of
words per category in the experiment and each of the five experimental blocks consisted of a
similar amount of task switches and task repetitions. Task cues consisted of either vowels (“A”,
“E”, “I”, “O”, or “U”) or the consonants “V”, “F”, “L”, “Q”, or “C” and they never reoccurred
in two or three subsequent trials to avoid a salient association of specific cue sequences with
rewards (as in Braem, 2017). Task cues were randomly presented above or below a central
fixation cross with an offset of 1% of the inner window height and a hashtag was presented at
the other location. They had to be activated by pressing the task activation keys “E” (above)
versus “D” (below), or “I” (above) versus “K” (below), depending on whether the left or right
hand was the participant’s task hand, randomized across participants. Stimuli had to be
categorized with the “S” (left) or “D” (right) key or the “K” (left) or “L” (right) key
respectively, i.e., task set choice was on a vertical axis, while the decision was made on a
horizontal axis. The left key always corresponded to the “smaller” response and the right key
to the “larger” response, as this is a more natural response mapping. For the other task, the left
versus right key were randomly assigned to the animate versus inanimate condition to ensure
counter-balancing across participants of task rule congruency per item. In the practice trials,
we included three different feedback messages: “VERKEERDE TOETS!” (Dutch for “wrong
key”) for pressing the wrong activation key, “CORRECT!” or “FOUT!” (Dutch for “error”)
after responding to the target, and “TE TRAAG!” (Dutch for “too slow”) if they responded too
slowly. In the reward phase, we presented high rewards (“+10”) and low rewards (“+1”) in the
centre of the screen (as in Braem, 2017).
Task procedure
The experiment was conducted online. The total duration was about 30-35 minutes. As
in Braem (2017), participants were informed that they had to perform two different tasks,
categorize the subsequent target stimulus into being smaller or larger than a basketball, when
seeing a vowel, they had to categorize it according to their animacy, with animate referring to
all organisms (plants, animals, fruits and vegetables). Participants were encouraged to respond
as fast and accurately as possible. Moreover, participants had to “activate” each task cue by
pressing either the upper or lower key depending on the location of the cue (above or below
the fixation cross). After receiving instructions on this trial sequence, participants practiced
twelve cued trials of each task separately. If they activated the task with the wrong activation
key, they saw a warning and had to repeat until they pressed the correct key. They received
performance feedback after correct and incorrect responding to the target and a warning if they
responded too slowly (response deadline of 5s). These practice trials were followed by a full
practice block (baseline block) of 80 trials, in which they further encountered sixteen free
choice trials (20%; randomly interspersed with at least 1 cued trial in between). In these free
choice trials of main interest, they saw both letter types (above and below the fixation cross)
and were told to choose freely which task they wanted to perform by activating the
corresponding letter. In this baseline block, they only received feedback after correctly
responding and were presented with a black screen of similar duration after incorrect
responding. In addition to training participants on the two tasks, this block was also
implemented to help rule out potential group differences in VSR independent of the main
manipulation. However, in retrospect, we did not have sufficient trials per baseline block to
compute a reliable VSR (max 16 trials after preprocessing).
Following the baseline block, participants performed the four main experimental blocks
(again consisting of 80 trials each), in which performance feedback on correct trials was
replaced by reward feedback according to the participant’s reward group. Group assignment
was random and participants were blind to the manipulation. If they were in the switch group,
they received the high reward in 80% after correct responding to a switch trial (and the low
reward in the remaining 20%) and the low reward in 80% after correct responding to a
repetition trial (and the high reward in the remaining 20%). This coding was reversed for the
other reward group which was selectively reinforced on task repetitions. In between blocks,
participants were able to take self-paced breaks. At the end of the experiment they filled in one
open ended and one multiple choice question on contingency awareness. First, they were
simply asked if they felt like some rounds were more often highly rewarded than others, or if
this was completely arbitrary. Second, we described that participants were either rewarded
more if two subsequent tasks were the same, different, or that reward magnitude was truly
arbitrarily, and asked to indicate which of those three options was consistent with their
experience.
Task procedure
Note. Trial procedure based on a participant in the group rewarded more on switches.
Participants underwent five blocks with 80 trials each, out of which 80% where cued.
Depending on the reward group, participants either received a high or low reward following a
task switch in 80 (20)% of the time. Free choice trials were not rewarded but provided
performance feedback upon correct responding. On cued trials, participants had to activate a
predetermined cue, on free choice trials, they could freely select which task they want to
perform.
Pre-processing
All exclusion and preprocessing pipelines were preregistered. At the participant level,
we removed data from all participants performing below 60% accuracy per task and with a too
low VSR in the baseline block. Although we preregistered to exclude participants with a VSR
less than 10% in the baseline block, we also analysed two other exclusion criteria (no exclusion
and 20%), as there are currently no gold standards in this literature (Arrington & Logan, 2005;
Braem, 2017). In what follows, we will present the results according to the most conservative
exclusion criterion (i.e., 20%), but note that the statistical conclusions were identical across all
three exclusion criteria. At the trial level, we removed all trials following an error for the
accuracy analyses. For the VSR and RT analyses, we additionally excluded all error trials . In
both VSR and RT models, we further removed all trials where the RT was within the slowest
1% (within-subject) as well as RT faster than 200ms. We additionally excluded first trials from
all analyses. Factors were set to zero sum coding and continuous variables were standardized.
Data analysis
The main statistical analyses were conducted with Bayesian mixed-effects models
using brms (Bürkner, 2017) and RStudio. All analyses were performed on the four rewarded
main experimental blocks. Our planned main model predicted transition choice (switch or
repetition) in free choice trials (modelled with Bernoulli distributions (logit link)) based on
group (between-subjects factor) and using random participant intercepts. This model was fit
with 8000 iterations (of which 4000 warmup iterations across four chains). We also ran a
planned follow-up model including block number to investigate potential changes over time.
Additionally, we preregistered analyses on task performance for cued and free choice trials
separately, predicting RT and accuracy based on group, congruency, transition and their
interactions, using random participant intercepts and random slopes for congruency,
transition and their interaction. RT was modelled using a shifted lognormal distribution
(using 20000 iterations and 10000 warmup iterations across four chains) and accuracy using a
Bernoulli distribution (using 4000 iterations and 2000 warmup iterations across four chains),
using the logit link and link function. As we noted important differences between tasks, we
decided to add task choice to the model. To account for differences between stimuli and
2 These preprocessing criteria were adopted from Braem (2017) and other similar studies. However, it is worth
noting that the exclusion of fast and slow RT as well as of error and post-error trials in the task sequence
analyses is less important in our case where task choice can be inferred independently of task execution.
Running our main VSR model of interest including all trials did not change the patterns of our results in
Experiment 1 (but see Footnote 4 on Experiment 2). Using the same pre-processing criteria but applying the RT
exclusion to the choice instead of the task RT also did not affect the results.
enable generalization outside our stimulus set, we added random intercepts for stimuli
(leading to a crossed-random effect structure). Due to an insufficient number of observations
per cell, task could not be modelled as a random slope.
𝑅𝑇/𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 = 𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝 ∗ 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 ∗ (𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑔𝑟𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 + 𝑇𝑎𝑠𝑘) + (𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 ∗
𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑔𝑟𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 | 𝑆𝑢𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡) + (1| 𝑆𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑢𝑠).
Significance of effects was inferred based on whether the 95% credible intervals (CI)
of the regression weights include zero (two-sided test). We additionally report the probability
of direction [pd], indicating the proportion of the posterior distribution that is of the median's
sign.
Results
All analyses below are performed on the free choice data. Results tables for
performance analyses on the cued trials can be found in Appendix A. Additional exploratory
analyses on activation RT are reported in Appendix B. An initial t-test on the 16 free choice
trials of the baseline block prior to preprocessing did not reveal any difference in VSR
between the switch group (M= 49.49, SD= 12.81) and repeat group (M = 50.13, SD = 14.90)
prior to the experimental blocks with the reward manipulation (t(95) = -0.227, p = 0.820),
suggesting that any potential group differences in the main analyses cannot be explained by
group characteristics.
Voluntary Switch Rate
Our main model revealed no significant effect of reward group on the switch
probability (Est. = 0.007, 95% CI [-0.070, 0.084], pd= 57.13%), i.e., the group rewarded
more on switches did not switch significantly more often (M=45.61, SD=9.28) than the group
modulation over time as the model including block as a predictor indicated the absence of a
main effect of block (Est. = -0.035, 95% CI [-0.093, 0.023], pd= 88.31%) or interaction
between group and block (Est.= 0.032, 95% CI [-0.025, 0.090], pd= 86.38%).
Voluntary switch rate per group

Accuracy model
In the accuracy model we found a main effect of task choice (Est. = 0.267, 95% CI
[0.140, 0.394], pd = 100%) with participants being overall more accurate on the animacy as
compared to the size task. We did not see any main effect or interaction effect of reward
group, transition or congruency (see Appendix A). However, we observed an unexpected
group by task choice interaction (Est. = 0.213, 95% CI [0.087, 0.339], pd= 99.96%), with the
group rewarded more on switches showing a smaller difference in accuracy between the tasks
Task cost difference between the two reward groups
Note. The group rewarded more on switches showed a smaller difference in accuracy
between the size task and the animacy task. Thin lines represent the mean plus and minus the
standard error.
Reaction time model
In the RT model, we found main effects of transition (Est. = -0.032, 95% CI [-0.050, -
0.014], pd= 99.98%), congruency (Est. = -0.012, 95% CI [-0.024, -0.001], pd= 97.98%), and
task choice (Est. = -0.072, 95% CI [-0.089, -0.054], pd= 100%), with participants being
significantly faster on repetition, congruent and animacy trials. However, we did not observe
any main effect or interaction effect with reward group.
Relationship of (cued) task and switch cost with choice behaviour
Importantly, we noticed a strong preference for the animacy task in participants’
choices (chosen in 79%, averaged across participant’s choice rates with no significant
difference between groups), which also seemed to be the objectively easier task as indicated
by the faster RTs (M= 942.13, SD= 267.66) and higher accuracy (M= 0.91, SD= 0.10)
compared to the size task (RT: M= 1078.87, SD= 290.74; accuracy: M= 0.81, SD=0.22, see
model results). This suggests that task choice during the free choice trials was more driven by
task difficulty, rather than task switching difficulty. To test if task difficulty and task choice
4). First, we tested if the task cost, i.e., the difference in RT and accuracy between the size vs.
animacy on cued trials was associated with task choice on free choice trials. Note, that this
task cost was also significant in both the RT and accuracy model fitted to those cued trials,
though not modulated by group (see Appendix A). Second, we also tested whether the switch
cost on cued trials, i.e., the difference in RT and accuracy on switch vs. repeat trials was
associated with the probability of switching tasks between trials. Our analyses showed that
the choice of the size task was indeed negatively associated with RT (r(95)=-0.487, p <0.001;
costs on cued trials were less likely to choose the more difficult task on free choice trials and
vice versa. Interesting, this was not true for the relationship between the probability to switch
on free choice trials and the switch cost on cued trials in both RT (r(95)= 0.107, p=0.296) and
accuracy (r(95)= 0.023, p=0.822), i.e., people with higher switch costs were not less likely to
switch on free choice trials.
Relationship between task (sequence) difficulty and task (sequence) preference
Note. Participants with larger task costs on cued trials were less likely to choose the size task
on free choice trials (upper). The switch cost on cued trials did not affect the voluntary switch
rate (lower).
Additional exploratory analyses
Contingency awareness. In general, 50% of the participants indicated that rewards
were arbitrary, 28% guessed their reward condition correctly, and 22% guessed their reward
condition incorrectly. We ran an additional model on the probability to switch, adding
contingency awareness (correct or incorrect guess of the reward condition) as a variable.
Theses analyses revealed no main effect of awareness (Est. = 0.016, 95% CI [-0.072, 0.106],
pd= 64.38%) and no interaction effect between awareness and reward group (Est. = 0.019,
95% CI [-0.070, 0.107], pd= 66.71%).
Interim discussion
We did not replicate Braem’s (2017) findings in our adapted design where free choice
trials were interspersed and a task selection screen was used. Instead, we found that, rather
than guided by a reinforcement of task switching/repeating, participants’ task choice
behaviour was mostly driven by a strong preference for the (relatively easy) animacy task. It
might be that our manipulation, introducing the additional layer of having to activate a task,
was too complex for participants to detect the subtle reward contingencies. If anything, it
might have been the case that reward learning remained at the task level (rather than task
sequence level), manifesting as task cost differences between both groups, i.e., the reward
switch group showed smaller “task costs” in accuracy. While this is speculation, it may have
been the case that participants in the group rewarded more on switches attributed the rewards
to an overall higher task difficulty (i.e., because task switches are more difficult), relative to
the group rewarded more on repetitions. In turn, this perceived reinforcement of higher
difficulty may have led to more engagement and better accuracy on the noticeably more
Regardless of whether, or at which level, learning occurred, it seems that the task cost
(i.e., difference in task difficulty) generally dominated the switch cost in predicting choice
behaviour, possibly resulting from some cost-benefit trade-off of control (Kool & Botvinick,
2013; Shenhav et al., 2013). This is also in line with recent studies showing that avoidance of
task difficulty can dominate the repetition bias (Brosowsky & Egner, 2021; Fröber &
Dreisbach, 2023). In contrast, the coin flip instructions in previous task switching designs
(e.g., as in Braem, 2017) might have been more effective in nudging or causing participants
to consider task switching sequences, as opposed to the current design where no such
instructions were given. To evaluate whether our results were due to a lack of picking up the
contingency, in other words, to test whether VSR would be influenced when creating
awareness about task switching processes, we ran a second experiment in which we explicitly
informed all participants on their respective reward condition on cued trials. Moreover, we
added liking ratings before and after the experiment to test if the reward groups differ in
terms of their subjective switch preference following reinforcement.
Experiment 2
Methods
All methods were similar to Experiment 1 with one crucial difference in the
instructions. After the baseline block, i.e., before the start of the main experiment blocks, we
informed the participants that they were assigned to the switch or repetition group, meaning
that they had a higher chance to earn more reward on switch or repetition trials respectively.
We also explicitly informed them that this was only true for cued trials, but not true for the
free choice trials, which remained unrewarded. In addition, we assessed participants’
subjective preference to switch or repeat tasks once after the baseline block without rewards,
and again at the end of the experiment. Specifically, they could indicate with a slider from 0-
100 (starting point 0), what their preference was with “prefer to repeat” or “prefer to switch”
as the end points. We did not assess participants’ contingency ratings, assuming they trusted
their instructed group assignment and according reward contingency. Moreover, we looked at
accuracies for each word stimulus from Experiment 1 separately, and replaced items (n=18)
with low accuracies (e.g., “kitten” or “melon”) in the size task, in an attempt to further
balance (perceived) difficulty differences between the tasks. However, overall accuracy
across all trials (combining all free and cued trials prior to preprocessing) stayed the same,
i.e., 90% (Experiment 1) and 91% (Experiment 2) for the animacy task and 85% (both
experiments) for the size task. The overall RTs were 1066.35ms for the animacy task and
1244.44ms for the size task in Experiment 1 and 1073.85ms for the animacy task and
1277.96ms for the size task in Experiment 2. This suggests that our attempt to make both
tasks more equal in terms of task difficulty had little effect.
Participants
68 participants were recruited for the second experiment. After exclusion of accuracy
outliers, the sample consisted of 60 participants with a mean age of 19.82 (SD=4.70) out of
which 16 were male (44 female) and 10 left-handed. Considering VSR outliers from the
baseline block led to exclusion of two additional participants. Power analyses of the previous
study suggested a sample of 60 participants is sufficient (see above).
Results
Again, results below relate to the free choice trials. Results tables for performance
analyses on the cued trials can be found in Appendix C. Exploratory analyses on the choice
RT and the liking ratings are reported in Appendix D and E respectively. An initial t-test on
the baseline block prior to preprocessing did not reveal any difference in VSR between the
switch group (M= 50.45, SD=12.83) and repeat group (M=49.79, SD= 14.26) prior to the
experimental blocks with the reward manipulation (t(56)= 0.183, p= 0.855).
Voluntary Switch Rate
When informing participants on the reinforcement schedule, the main effect of reward
group reaches significance with a one-sided test (Est. = -0.097, 95% CI [-0.196, 0.002], pd =
97.24%). Specifically, participants that were rewarded more on switches did switch
significantly more often (M=48.81, SD=11.39) than participants rewarded more on
3 For a comprehensive view of the data, we also fitted the main model to all free choice trials without the
original preprocessing criteria, i.e., including fast and slow RT as well as error and post error trials (see Footnote
including the VSR outliers, and we also found no main effect of block (Est. = -0.007, 95% CI
[-0.085, 0.069], pd= 56.75%) and no interaction between block and reward group (Est. = -
0.008, 95% CI [-0.084, 0.068], pd= 57.56%).
Voluntary Switch Rate per group
Note. In Experiment 2, the group rewarded more on switches, switches more often than the
group rewarded more on repetitions, reaching significance in the expected direction with a
one-sided test. Dots present the mean per group, bars represent the mean plus and minus the
standard deviation.
Accuracy model
3). In this analysis, the main effect of group did not hold (Est. = -0.054, 95% CI [-0.144, 0.035], pd=88.50%).
However, we cannot rule out that error trials in this analysis were the result of erroneously having selected the
unintended task which might blunt the results. When applying the RT preprocessing criteria to the choice RT
rather than task RT, the effect was stronger (Est. = -0.104, 95% CI [-0.204, -0.002], pd= 97.74%).
Similar to the first experiment, we found an effect of task choice (Est. = 0.285, 95%
CI [0.118, 0.451], pd= 99.86%), with participants being more accurate on the animacy as
compared to the size task. However, we no longer observed an interaction of reward group
and task (Est. = -0.045, 95% CI [-0.212, 0.121], pd=69.75%). The model did reveal a
significant group by transition interaction (Est. = 0.180, 95% CI [0.020, 0.343], pd= 98.62%),
with the group rewarded more on switches showing reversed switch costs compared to the
group rewarded more on repetitions, i.e., they were on average more accurate on switches
than on repetitions. This result is arguably confounded with the switch group switching
slightly more on these free choice trials overall (see VSR results above), thus being slightly
more trained on alternations. Indeed, the effect disappeared when including participants’
mean VSR as an additional predictor in the model (Est. = -0.456, 95% CI [-1.392, 0.478],
pd= 83.41%). Notably, we found the same pattern in the cued trials, i.e., a significant group
by transition interaction where the switch group was more accurate on switch trials (Est. =
0.180, 95% CI [0.020, 0.343], see Appendix C).
RT model
As in Experiment 1, we found main effects for transition (Est. = -0.024, 95% CI -
0.043, -0.006], pd= 99.55%) and choice (Est. = -0.087, 95% CI [-0.106, -0.068], pd= 100%),
with participants being slower on switches and the size task. See Appendix C for all other
effects. Interestingly, we now observed an interaction between group and task choice in the
rewarded more on switches showing a smaller difference in RT between the size and animacy
task than the group rewarded more on repetitions.
Task cost difference between the two reward groups
Note. The group rewarded more on switches showed a smaller difference in reaction time
between the size task and the animacy task. Thin lines represent the mean plus and minus the
standard error.
Relationship of (cued) task and switch cost with choice behaviour
Given that we now made participants more aware of task switching processes (by
informing them on their reinforcement group), and tried to decrease the difference in task
difficulty by replacing some of the items (see Method), we were interested in seeing whether
we would still observe the same relationships between task costs and switch costs on task
choice and VSR. We still observed a clear preference for the animacy task, which participants
chose in 80% of the trials as well as better task performance in RT (M= 980.40, SD= 295.88)
and accuracy (M= 0.92, SD= 0.09) in the animacy as compared to the size task (RT:
M=1191.46, SD=409.10; accuracy: M= 0.86, SD=0.21, see model results). Again,
participants showing a larger task RT cost also showed a decreased choice rate of the size
task (r(56)= -0.422, p <0.001). However, we no longer observed the same effect in task
accuracy costs (r(56)= -0.129, p = 0.336). No relationship was found between the switch cost
in RT (r(56)= -0.058, p=0.666) or accuracy (r(56)= -0.133, p= 0.318) and switch probability
(see Appendix F for plots). However, excluding the two outliers with VSRs below 20% in the
experiment blocks, revealed a significant correlation between accuracy switch costs and VSR
(r(56)=-0.330, p=0.013) in the expected direction, with participants with a larger switch cost
switching less than participants with a lower switch cost.
Interim Discussion
The results of Experiment 2 suggest that making participants aware of the reward
manipulation leads to more task switching in the group rewarded more on task switches, even
with free choice trials not being rewarded. Thus, the lack of a reinforcement effect in
Experiment 1 was possibly due to a lack of manipulation awareness. Moreover, we again
observed smaller task costs in the group rewarded more on task switches, albeit now in RT
instead of accuracy as found in Experiment 1.
General Discussion
Across two experiments, we tested whether we can selectively reinforce voluntary
task switching when interspersing free choice trials in between cued trials where participants
first had to indicate their task choice on each trial. Answering this research question is crucial
to obtain a better understanding on how we learn to regulate different control strategies and
adaptively change between cognitive flexibility and stability (Braem & Egner, 2018;
Dreisbach & Fröber, 2019; Goschke & Bolte, 2014; Jurczyk et al., 2019; Musslick & Cohen,
2021; Qiao et al., 2023). Our study is a conceptual replication of an earlier study by Braem
(2017) who found this effect on voluntary task switching in a blocked design without task
activation screens, i.e., in contrast to our study, participants did not have to register the task
(on cued choice trials) or indicate their choice (on free choice trials). We did not observe an
effect of reinforcement in the first experiment in which participants were not explicitly aware
of the reinforcement schedule at the start of the experiment, but did observe the effect in a
second experiment where they were explicitly informed about it. This suggests that
participants were not able to learn the reinforcement schedule in the first experiment, and
because of this did not show transfer from the rewarded cued trials to unrewarded free choice
trials. Perhaps this is due to our design being more complex than Braem’s (2017).
Participants not only had to keep track of the sequence of two subsequent trials, but they also
had to pay attention to where task cues appear and activate them. This possibly left little
resources for picking up on the more subtle reward manipulation consistent with the notion of
an attentional bottleneck.
Instead, across both experiments, participants’ choices were mainly driven by a
preference for the animacy task. This finding fits with a line of recent studies showing that
(task) goal perseverance can be a driving factor of task choice even when this implies
flexibility at a lower level of the action control hierarchy (Fröber & Dreisbach, 2023).
Similarly, although this is speculative at this point, reward learning may have occurred at the
task level through a perceived differential contingency with overall difficulty, wrongfully
attributed to the more difficult tasks rather than more difficult task sequences. That is, being
rewarded on more difficult (switch) trials, may have increased caution on the more difficult
size task, as reflected in smaller differences in task performance in accuracy (Experiment 1)
or reaction time (Experiment 2). One potential take-away from the strong task preference
observed in our experiment could be that the coin flip instructions in previous voluntary task
switching experiments (e.g., Arrington & Logan, 2005; Braem, 2017) are helpful after all in
nudging participants to consider more abstract control strategies, rather than only considering
the task level, when performing free choice paradigms.
The preference for the animacy task was mainly driven by a difference in difficulty
between the two tasks as reflected in slower RT and lower accuracy on the size as compared
to the animacy task. The observation that this cost dominated the switch cost is further
consistent with recent work showing that increased difficulty of a task can induce flexibility
(Brosowsky & Egner, 2021; see also Mittelstädt et al., 2022 for comparable findings on
perceptual difficulty). Thus, to obtain a purer measure of switch costs, we would need to use
two tasks that are similar in difficulty.
In contrast to Braem (2017), we did not find a group by congruency interaction in
either experiment. This lack of finding group differences in congruency effects might be
explained by the dissociation of task activation (or choice) and execution in our study where
participants had time to prepare for the specific task at hand. However, this might not solely
explain the result as there is a body of research suggesting that congruency effects do not
benefit from preparation time as much (see Kiesel et al., 2010 for a review).
In sum, our findings suggest that selective reinforcement of task switching may be
possible, but that it requires more simplistic or parsimonious designs allowing the detection
of such a subtle manipulation. Without being nudged towards considering more abstract
control strategies, participants may resort to regulating responses at a less abstract (task)
level. However, once participants are made aware of the reinforcement schedule, they seem
to successfully generalize learned control strategies to unrewarded trials in line with current
theories on cognitive control.
