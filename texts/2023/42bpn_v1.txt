Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 2
Abstract
In a typical probabilistic cuing experiment, participants are asked to find a visual
target among a series of distractors. Although participants are not informed about this,
the target appears more frequently in one region of the display, resulting in faster search
times for targets located in this region. This bias is thought to depend on a habit-like
attentional control mechanism, unconstrained by the availability of working memory
(WM) resources. However, the only study that has explored this feature in the past
suffers from methodological shortcomings that leave the results open to alternative
explanations. In three experiments we aimed to confirm whether probabilistic cuing is
unaffected by visual, spatial, and spatiotemporal WM load. For each experiment, one
group of participants performed the visual search task during the retention interval of a
WM task (high-load group), whereas other group of participants (no-load group) carried
out the visual search task after the WM task. We hypothesized that the probabilistic
cuing effect would be larger for the no-load group compared to the high-load group.
This hypothesis was confirmed in one experiment, but exploratory analyses suggest that
the results can be highly dependent on the analytic approach, casting doubts on its
robustness. Overall, our results provide partial support for the hypothesis that
probabilistic cuing is not affected by a secondary task. However, given that some
analyses reveal an effect of WM load, we conclude that it might be premature to rule
out the possibility that the expression of this attentional bias requires WM resources.

Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 3
Visual statistical learning can improve attentional selection, allowing us to look
for the object we want to find in a more efficient way (Chun & Turk-Browne, 2008;
Goujon et al., 2015). For example, when we want to close a program in our Windows
laptop, we will look for the cross on the upper right side of the program, given that this
is its more probable location. One of the tasks that has been used to study this process is
location probability learning or probabilistic cuing (Jiang & Sisk, 2019). In the typical
task used to explore this effect (e.g., Jiang et al., 2013, 2014), participants search for a
visual target among several distractors and respond to its orientation. The target appears
more often in one region of the display (i.e., the rich quadrant) than in the others (i.e.,
the sparse quadrants). Participants are not informed about the probability distribution of
the target position. However, response times (RT) eventually become faster for trials in
which the target appears in the rich quadrant compared to the sparse quadrants.
Jiang and Sisk (2019) have proposed that the attentional bias produced by
probabilistic cuing is not goal-driven or stimulus-driven. Instead, it could be
characterized as an attentional habit. As such, it shares certain characteristics with motor
habits (Dickinson, 1985; Luque et al., 2020): It is gradual (i.e., it develops after
extensive experience), implicit (i.e., participants are not aware about the spatial
distribution of the target), persistent (once acquired, it is difficult to unlearn, even when
the bias is no longer advantageous), viewer-centered (i.e., the rich region is coded
relative to the participants perspective), transferable only to other serial search tasks,
and insensitive to working memory load (i.e., taxing cognitive resources with a
secondary task does not impede the learning of the bias). In contrast to this view,
previous studies from our laboratory have concluded that probabilistic cuing might not
possess some of these features (Giménez-Fernández et al., 2020; Vadillo et al., 2020).
In particular, we found no support for the hypotheses that probabilistic cuing is gradual,
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 4
implicit or persistent. The aim of the present series of experiments is to address whether
probabilistic cuing is independent of working memory (WM) load.
So far, this question has only been explored by Won and Jiang (2015). These
authors asked participants to perform a probabilistic cuing task during the retention
interval of a WM task, manipulating the amount of cognitive load demanded by this
secondary task. For half of the trials, the encoding and the probe displays of the WM
task had to be ignored (no-load condition). For the other half (high-load condition),
participants had to decide which stimulus had varied between the encoding and the
probe display (Experiment 1) or whether the encoding display and the probe display
were identical (Experiments 2 and 3). In three experiments, they found that the
magnitude of the probabilistic cuing effect did not diminish under high WM load.
Hence, Won and Jiang (2015) concluded that the bias producing the probabilistic cuing
effect was not dependent on WM resources—consistent with the conclusion that it is the
result of an automatic attentional habit.
As we will show, there are reasons to remain skeptical about Won and Jiang
(2015) main conclusions. Firstly, the (in)dependence of WM resources has been also
explored in a similar implicit learning paradigm known as contextual cuing, with less
than conclusive results. In a typical contextual cuing experiment, participants carry out a
visual search task that is superficially identical to the probabilistic cuing task, except
that in this case some of the displays are repeated throughout the task and other displays
are completely new. Eventually, reaction times become faster for repeated compared to
new displays. Several studies found that contextual cuing was not observed if
participants were asked to concurrently perform a WM task (Chen et al., 2019;
Manginelli et al., 2012). However, not all the studies have replicated these results
(Annac et al., 2013, Experiment 2D; Manginelli et al., 2013, Experiment 1) and there
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 5
are several attempts to explain why WM load sometimes does and sometimes does not
impair contextual cuing. For instance, it has been argued that WM load might impair the
expression of contextual cuing but not learning itself (Goujon et al., 2015; Pollmann,
2019). It has also been claimed that contextual cuing might be impaired or not
depending on the type of WM task. There is some consensus that WM tasks with a
strong spatial component impair the expression of contextual cuing more effectively
than other WM tasks (Manginelli et al., 2013; Travis et al., 2013). Given that both,
contextual cuing and probabilistic cuing are thought to share similar mechanisms (Jiang
& Sisk, 2019), the results observed in contextual cuing suggest that probabilistic cuing
may be dependent on WM resources, at least under some conditions.
Furthermore, there are theoretical reasons to cast doubts on the independence of
probabilistic cuing of working memory resources. Working memory allows us to
temporary store and manipulate information and is fundamental to accomplish complex
cognitive tasks such as language comprehension, reasoning, and learning (Baddeley,
1992). Also, numerous studies have found that working memory is intimately related to
selective attention (e.g., Awh et al., 1998; Hollingworth & Luck, 2009; Olivers et al.,
2006). Importantly, Won and Jiang (2015) hypothesized that the probabilistic cuing
effect might be independent of working memory resources because this effect is
considered the outcome of an implicit learning mechanism. However, in a recent study,
we found that, overall, participants seem to be aware of the regularities involved in this
task. Specifically, more than 60% of participants were able to identify the rich quadrant
when asked right after finishing the task, suggesting that the probabilistic cuing effect
may not be entirely unconscious (Giménez-Fernández et al., 2020). Therefore, during a
probabilistic cuing task, participants may need working memory resources to update the
information about the spatial distribution of the target on a trial-by-trial basis, increasing
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 6
search efficiency. If this hypothesis is correct, the amount of visual, spatial, or
spatiotemporal load imposed by the WM task might determine the extent to which
probabilistic cuing is impaired. In summary, we think that probabilistic cuing may be a
goal-driven attentional bias produced by explicit learning of the spatial distribution of
the target and, as such, it may be dependent of working memory resources.
There are also methodological reasons for taking Won and Jiang’s (2015) results
with caution. First, each experiment was carried out with a sample of 18 participants.
This sample size is sufficiently large to detect the basic probabilistic cuing effect but
may be inadequate to explore potential differences between WM load conditions. Won
and Jiang (2015) interpreted that WM load does not influence probabilistic cuing
because the interaction between quadrant (rich vs. sparse) and the WM load in
Experiments 2 and 3 did not achieve statistical significance. In Experiment 1, they
found a significant interaction that indicated larger probabilistic cuing under a high WM
load. However, considering such small sample sizes, we think that there are good
reasons to consider this evidence inconclusive. A simple means to illustrate this point is
to quantify how much support these data lend to the hypothesis that probabilistic cuing
was unaffected by WM load. This can be easily done with Bayesian analysis. With the
information reported by Won and Jiang we can estimate that the negative interaction
between quadrant and WM load detected in Experiment 1, F(1, 17) = 5.27, corresponds
to a BF of 1.92 in favor of the alternative hypothesis that cuing is modulated by WM
load (modelled as a Cauchy distribution scaled at .707) over the null hypothesis. This
evidence is insufficient to discriminate between the null and the alternative hypotheses.
For Experiment 2, Won and Jiang did not report sufficient information to conduct a
similar analysis, but for Experiment 3, they reported that the cuing effect was not
significantly different in the high-load and no-load conditions, t(17) = 0.53, which
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 7
corresponds to a BF = 0.27. This can be considered moderate evidence in favor of the
null hypothesis (Lee & Wagenmakers, 2013), but in any case, far from conclusive.
These complementary Bayesian analyses suggest that it would be desirable to put these
hypotheses to the test with larger samples.
Setting statistical considerations aside, we think that the procedure employed by
Won and Jiang (2005) can be improved. In Experiment 1, the rich quadrant was the
same for both the high-load and the no-load conditions. Even under the assumption that
a high WM load can interfere with probabilistic cuing, one would expect that any
learning taking place in the no-load condition could generalize to performance in the
high-load trials. This possibility makes the result hard to interpret, given that the
probabilistic cuing effect observed in the high-load condition could be due to the
information learnt during the no-load condition. In Experiments 2 and 3, there were two
different rich quadrants for each participant, one for each WM load condition. However,
this might not suffice to eliminate carry-over effects between both WM load conditions.
If the two rich quadrants happened to be adjacent to each other, for instance, then search
times in the rich quadrant of the high-load condition could easily benefit from any
learning about the rich quadrant in the no-load condition. Ideally, this hypothesis should
be tested with a procedure that prevents any carry-over effect between both WM load
conditions.
As a secondary aim, the present series of experiments explored whether WM
reduces the expression of probabilistic cuing or affects learning itself. As noted above,
research conducted with contextual cuing tasks suggests that working memory load
might not affect learning itself, but the processes involved in translating this learning to
an observable response (Goujon et al., 2015; Pollmann, 2019). This conclusion is based
on evidence that although WM load sometimes seems to abolish contextual cuing,
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 8
significant levels of cuing are nevertheless found as soon as WM load is removed from
the task. An ideal experiment pursuing this idea in the probabilistic cuing paradigm
should complement the original design used by Won and Jiang (2015) with a final
testing stage free of working memory load that could potentially reveal evidence of
latent learning. If working memory load affects only the expression of learning, robust
evidence of probabilistic cuing should be observed in a testing stage without WM load,
even if the effect seems to be absent during the training under WM load. That is,
participants who conduct the task under high WM load may be learning the bias but not
expressing it until the WM load is removed. On the contrary, if WM load affects
learning itself, then removing the secondary WM task should not reveal any evidence of
probabilistic cuing. Given that Won and Jiang (2015) did not include a testing stage,
this is the first study to explore this question.
In sum, our aim in the present series of experiments was to explore whether
probabilistic cuing is unaffected by WM load once the above-mentioned problems are
addressed. Additionally, we explored for the first time if WM load affects learning
and/or performance in a probabilistic cuing task. We carried out three experiments in
which participants had to perform a probabilistic cuing task, but with some important
changes with respect to Won and Jiang’s (2015) work. First, we obtained data from a
sample of participants that allows us to obtain stronger evidence for the influence of
WM on probabilistic cuing. Second, to avoid carry-over effects between the rich
quadrant in the high-load condition and the no-load condition, working memory load
was manipulated between-subjects. Third, to ensure that both groups were differently
loaded and following Annac et al. (2013), half of the participants (high-load group)
carried out the visual search task between the encoding and the probe display of a WM
task, whereas the other half of the participants (no-load group) carried out the visual
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 9
search task after the probe display of the WM task (i.e., the search task was executed
without a concurrent WM load). Fourth, in order to explore whether WM load affects
learning or the expression of learning we added, at the end of the learning stage, a
testing stage without the concurrent WM task, where the target was evenly distributed
across quadrants.
As in Won and Jiang (2015), the nature of the secondary WM task was visual in
Experiment 1, spatial in Experiment 2, and spatiotemporal in Experiment 3 to explore
whether different modalities could differentially affect probabilistic cuing. Even though
Won and Jiang did not find any interference of WM load on probabilistic cuing, our
main prediction was that both the learning and the expression of probabilistic cuing
would be impaired by the secondary task in all the experiments. We speculated that
during the probabilistic cuing task participants need to rehearse information about the
location of the targets. The encoding display of the WM task also needs to be rehearsed,
therefore, these two tasks will compete for WM resources and will interfere with each
other. Note that this does not necessarily mean that all three tasks would have the same
impact on probabilistic cuing. Given that the probabilistic cuing effect is driven by
regularities in the spatial distribution of targets, we hypothesized that WM tasks that
require participants to store and retrieve spatial information would have a greater impact
on probabilistic cuing than other WM tasks. This led us to think that the secondary tasks
of Experiments 2 and 3 would interfere more strongly with probabilistic cuing.
Method
Experiment 1
Participants
As we will explain in the Planned Analyses section, we analyzed data using
frequentist and Bayesian approaches. This allowed us to set our sample size following
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 10
an open-ended sequential Bayes factor design, as explained in Schönbrodt and
Wagenmakers (2018). The crucial analysis for this experiment is the comparison of the
size of the probabilistic cuing effect in the high-load group and the no-load group in the
learning stage. This difference was analyzed with a frequentist and a Bayesian t-test for
independent samples. As no prior information regarding previous results is available,
we used the JZS default Bayes factor for an independent samples t-test, assuming a
zero-centered Cauchy distribution of effect sizes with the default scale parameter of
√2/2. We planned to gather data from at least 30 participants per group and then
continue testing participants until the Bayes factor reached to 6 in favor of either the
null or the alternative hypothesis or we reached 60 participants per group. The
maximum sample size of 60 participants per group would grant a statistical power of .80
to detect an effect size of d = 0.46.
Participants were Psychology students from our university, who were rewarded
with course credit for their contribution. None had taken part in any previous
probabilistic cuing experiment, and all of them conducted the experiment in small
groups in a laboratory equipped with 12 individual cubicles. The study was approved by
the university ethics committee (ref. CEI-80-1473) and all participants provided
informed consent.
Stimuli
Each trial began with a WM encoding display, consisting of four squares
presented in four different colors randomly chosen amongst red, green, blue, yellow,
magenta and cyan. The four squares were arranged in the same spatial configuration as
the arrow keys of a standard keyboard. Each side of the square was 3 cm and the
separation between squares was 1 cm. In the probe display, a randomly chosen square
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 11
had a different color than in the encoding display in half of the trials. For the other half
of the trials, the probe display was identical as the encoding display.
Visual search displays consisted of 15 L-shaped distractors (which could be
rotated 0º, 90º, 180º, and 270º) and one T-shaped target (which could be rotated 90º or
270º). Distractors and targets were positioned in a 11 × 11 grid, invisible to participants.
This grid was placed inside a 20.7 cm × 20.7 cm white frame. Each quadrant contained
four stimuli (either four distractors or three distractors and the target). All stimuli were
presented in white against a black background. The horizontal and vertical lines of all
stimuli were 9 mm in length. This visual display is based on a previous experiment
carried out in our laboratory that showed a robust probabilistic cuing effect (Giménez-
Fernández et al., 2020).
Procedure and Design
At the beginning of the experiment, participants were informed that they would
have to carry out two tasks concurrently. When a visual search display was presented,
participants had to search for the target (i.e., the only T in the display) as quickly as
possible and press the <left arrow> key if the stem of the T pointed to the left (rotated
90º) or <right arrow> key if it pointed to the right (rotated 270º). When four squares
were presented (i.e., encoding display of the WM task) participants had to memorize the
colors of the squares and when the probe display was presented participants had to
indicate if the encoding and the probe display were identical, pressing the <A> key, or
to indicate both displays were different, pressing the <Z>. For half of the participants
(high-load group) the visual search task was presented during the interval between the
encoding and the probe display of the WM task. The other half of the participants (no-
load group) the visual search task was presented after the probe display was responded.
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 12
For both groups, each trial began with a fixation cross presented for 2000 ms at
the center of the screen, followed by 500 ms presentation of the encoding display. In the
high-load group, after 350 ms of black screen, the search display appeared and remained
onscreen for a maximum of 3000 ms. The left or right orientation of the target was
determined randomly in each trial. If the response was incorrect, a sad face icon “:(”
was presented on the screen for 300 ms. If the response was correct, a smiley face icon
“:)” appeared for 300 ms. If no response was given a message “No response” appeared
on the screen for 300 ms. To achieve a retention interval of 4000 ms between the
encoding and the probe display, after the feedback a blank screen was presented for a
variable time from a minimum of 350 ms to a maximum of the amount of time needed
to achieve 4000 ms between the encoding and the probe display depending on the
participant’s response time for the visual search task. The probe display appeared
immediately afterwards and remained on the screen for a maximum of 3000 ms.
Participants’ responses to the probe display were followed by feedback using the same
procedure as for the visual search task, that is, if participants made a mistake, a sad face
icon appeared on the screen for 300 ms followed by 500 ms of blank screen. If
participants answered correctly, a smiley icon appeared for 300 ms. If participants made
no response the message “No response” appeared on the screen for 300 ms and was
followed by 500 ms of blank screen. A final blank screen was presented for 500 ms
before the next trial started. In the no-load group, the encoding display was followed by
a 4000 ms blank screen. The probe display then appeared on the screen until
participants’ response or for a maximum of 3000 ms. Feedback to the response was
followed by 500 ms of blank screen. After 300 ms of blank screen, the search display
was presented. This display remained on the screen until participants’ response or for a
maximum of 3000 ms. After response feedback, a final blank screen was be presented
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 13
procedure that we used in the three experiments. To avoid fatigue, the task stopped after
trials 72, 144, and 216 and participants were able to resume it by pressing any button.
The task began with 4 practice trials in which the target location was evenly
distributed across the four quadrants. During the learning stage, nine blocks of 24 trials
were presented to participants. Within each block, 12 trials (50%) contained the target
in one of the quadrants of the search display (rich quadrant) and the other half of the
trials the target appeared 4 times in each of the remaining quadrants (sparse quadrants).
At the beginning of the experiment, each participant was assigned one rich quadrant that
remained the same throughout the experiment. After this learning stage finished, all
participants carried out a testing stage without the concurrent WM task. Participants
received the instruction that from now on they only had to respond to the orientation of
the T. In this stage, the target appeared evenly distributed across the four quadrants.
This testing stage comprised 3 blocks of 24 trials each. Each trial began with a 2000 ms
fixation cross, followed by a visual search task that remained on the screen for a
maximum of 3000 ms. The next trial began 500 ms after response feedback.
After the task was completed, participants answered a brief awareness test
comprising two questions. First, we showed participants a square divided in four

Note. Schematic illustration of the procedure. Participants had to memorize the colors of
four squares (Experiment 1), the spatial distribution of 10 points (Experiment 2), and
the sequence of appearance of four dots (Experiment 3). In Experiment 3, each dot was
presented for 100 ms followed by 400 ms of black screen. When the visual search
display appeared onscreen, participants had to indicate if the T was pointing to the left
or to the right. When the probe display appeared, participants had to press a key to
indicate if the probe display or sequence was equal or different from the encoding
display or sequence. Participants in the high-load group performed the visual search
task after the coding display had disappeared. The procedure ensured that the total
amount of time between the coding display and the probe display was 4000 ms in both
groups. After participant’s response, a visual feedback appeared for 300 ms. In the WM
task, a wrong response or a no response was followed by 500 ms of black screen after
the feedback. The numbers below each display represent time in milliseconds.
quadrants representing the search display and we asked them: “Has the T appeared with
higher probability in a particular quadrant?”. They answered through a rating scale
ranging from 1 to 6, with options labelled “definitely not”, “probably not”, “possibly
not”, “possibly yes”, “probably yes”, and “definitely yes”, respectively. Immediately
afterwards, we asked participants to estimate how frequently the target had appeared in
each quadrant. To this aim, we showed them the same square representing the search
display divided into four quadrants, together with the following instructions: “Please
estimate the percentage of times that the T has appeared in each quadrant”. If the sum of
percentages was different from 100, participants were asked to revise their estimates.
This test has been shown to be a sensitive measure of participants awareness of the
spatial distribution of the target (Giménez-Fernández et al., 2020).
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 16
Planned Analyses
Search Times. Data from participants not able to conclude the task due to
equipment failure or experiment abandon were not considered. Additionally,
participants with overall accuracies below 95% in the visual search task or 3 standard
deviations below the mean accuracy of the whole sample in the WM task were removed
from the analyses. Practice trials, trials immediately following a rest break, and trials
with incorrect responses in the visual search task or in the WM task were removed from
the analyses. Then, for each participant we estimated the mean and standard deviation
(SD) of the valid RTs and removed any RT departing 3 or more SDs from each
participant’s mean.
To analyze participants’ performance during the learning stage, we used a
nonlinear mixed-effects approach (Brooks et al., 2010; Chun & Jiang, 2003).
Specifically, we fitted a power function to data from each condition from each
participant (RT = ix ) where i denotes the intercept of the function, x denotes the search
block and s denotes the slope of the function. That is, s represents the rate at which
reaction times decline progressively over blocks in each condition. If probabilistic cuing
benefits visual search, this decline should be steeper for the rich than for the sparse
condition. Consequently, the difference between the parameter s in conditions rich and
sparse can be taken as a measure of probabilistic cuing. For each subject we calculated
the difference between the s parameter for the sparse condition minus the s parameter
for the rich condition during the learning stage. We tested whether the basic
probabilistic cuing effect was found in each group comparing this difference score
against zero with a one-sample t-test and a Bayesian t-test for repeated measures,
separately for both groups. Then, we compared these difference scores in both groups
with a frequentist and Bayesian t-test for independent samples. Note that this is the
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 17
crucial test that was used to decide whether data collection can be finished before
reaching the maximum sample size. As explained above, for the Bayesian tests we
computed a Bayes factor comparing the relative evidence in favor of the alternative
hypothesis (modelled as a two-sided Cauchy distribution with the scaling factor set to
.707).
To analyze participants’ performance during the testing stage, we calculated the
difference between the mean RT in the rich quadrant condition and the mean RT in the
sparse quadrant condition, collapsing data from all blocks. We tested the probabilistic
cuing effect for both groups comparing the difference score against zero with a one-
sample t-test and a Bayesian t-test for repeated measures. We also compared this
difference in RT between both groups through a frequentist and a Bayesian independent
samples t-test.
Accuracy. To ensure that the reduction of RTs in the visual search task or in the
trials in which the target appears in the rich quadrant were not driven by a speed-
accuracy trade off, we analyzed error rates on each quadrant condition separately for
each group through a 2 (group: high-load vs no-load) × 2 (quadrant: rich vs sparse) × 2
(stage: learning vs testing) Bayesian and frequentist ANOVA. Error rates were defined
as the number of errors in the visual search task in each condition divided by the
number of trials within that condition.
WM Task Accuracy. To explore whether the visual search task influences
performance on the WM task, we compared the percentage of accurate responses in the
WM task in the high-load and the no-load groups through a frequentist and a Bayesian
t-test for independent samples.
Awareness Test. To analyze if participants notice the probability distribution of
target locations, for each group we calculated the median, the mean and its 95%
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 18
confidence interval of responses to the first question of the awareness test (i.e., “Has the
T appeared with higher probability in a particular quadrant?” ranging for 1 to 6, as
explained above). Additionally, we explored if the percentage estimation of the rich
quadrant for each group was different from 25% (chance level) through a frequentist
and a Bayesian one sample t-test. We also compared the percentage estimation of the
rich quadrant between groups through a frequentist and a Bayesian independent samples
t-test.
Experiment 2
Unless noted otherwise, Participants, Procedure and Design, and Planned
Analyses for Experiments 2 and 3 were identical to Experiment 1. For the spatial WM
task, the encoding display presented 10 white dots of 0.6 cm of diameter randomly
located in a 17 17 invisible grid. Half of the probe displays presented at the end of the
trial were identical to the encoding display and the other half showed one of the dots in
a different location. Participants had to press the <A> key to indicate that the encoding
and the probe displays were identical, and the <Z> key to indicate that both displays
the three experiments.
Experiment 3
For the spatiotemporal WM task, the encoding display consisted of a four-dot
sequence. These dots were 0.6 cm of diameter and could only appear in 16 locations of
a 4 4 invisible grid. The distance from the center of the screen of the 16 positions were
counterbalanced, so that eight of them were 4.9 cm from the center, other four were 6.2
cm from the center, other four were 3 cm from the center. Each dot appeared on the
screen for 100 ms followed for a blank screen for 400 ms. Half of the probe displays
presented the same sequence as the encoding display and the other half presented the
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 19
same four dots but two of them switched their temporal order. Participants had to
indicate whether the same sequence (<A> key) or a different sequence (<Z> key) had
both groups carried out.
Secondary analyses
Influence of WM Load on Probabilistic Cuing Across Experiments 1-3
To maximize statistical power, we collapsed data from the three experiments and
repeated the crucial analyses adding Experiment as an additional factor. That is, we
contrasted the difference in the s parameter between both quadrant conditions for the
high-load and the no-load through a two 3 (Experiment: 1-3) 2 (Group: high-load, no-
load) between-subjects ANOVA and its Bayesian equivalent. We also compared the
size of the probabilistic cuing effect (in milliseconds) during the testing stage through a
3 (Experiment: 1-3) 2 (Group: high-load, no-load) ANOVA and its Bayesian
equivalent. When the interaction between Experiment and Group was significant in any
of these analyses, we explored the source of the difference between experiments
through three 2 (Experiment: 1 vs. 2, 1 vs. 3, and 2 vs. 3) 2 (Group: high-load, no-
load) ANOVAs.
WM Task Accuracy
We assessed the difficulty of the different WM tasks in Experiments 1-3 (visual,
spatial, and spatiotemporal WM tasks). For this, we compared the percentage of
accurate responses in each of these tasks through a 3 (Experiment: 1-3) × 2 (Group:
high-load, no-load) between-subjects ANOVA and its Bayesian equivalent.
Relationship Between Probabilistic Cuing and Awareness
Additionally, we explored whether there is a relationship between the level of
awareness and the difference in performance in the probabilistic cuing task. This
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 20
analysis had only an exploratory purpose since, given the unreliability of these
dependent measures (Vadillo et al., 2020), we do not believe that a non-significant
correlation will necessarily mean that performance is not guided by explicit information.
However, given that in a previous study (Giménez-Fernández et al., 2020) we found a
correlation between performance and an awareness measure, we think that this result
deserves further exploration. To compute this correlation, we collapsed data from the
participants of the three experiments to maximize statistical power. We performed a
Pearson correlation coefficient between the probability estimation for the rich quadrant
and the difference between the RT in the sparse quadrant and the RT in the rich
quadrant during the test phase, using frequentist and Bayesian methods.
Power analysis of Won and Jiang
Since we found a significant effect of WM load on probabilistic cuing in the
preregistered analyses of Experiment 3, we explored whether the differences between
our results and those of Won and Jiang (2015) could be due to the higher statistical
power of the present experiments. For this purpose, we calculated the effect size (in
Cohen’s d units) for the crucial independent samples t-test comparing probabilistic
cuing in the learning stage in the high-load and no-load conditions. Then we
transformed this between-subjects effect size into its repeated-measures equivalent (i.e.,
Cohen’s d ) using the equations provided by Morris and DeShon (2002). This method
requires an estimate of the within-participants correlation between experimental
conditions, which cannot be computed with the statistical information reported by Won
and Jiang (2015). Vadillo et al. (2020) found that the split-half reliability of the
probabilistic cuing effect was .49. Therefore, in these analyses we assumed a correlation
of .50. But to confirm that the following results did not depend heavily on this
assumption, we conducted sensitivity analyses assuming correlations of .40 and .60.
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 21
Then, we calculated the statistical power to detect an effect of this size with the original
sample of 18 participants tested by Won and Jiang.
Results of the Preregistered Analyses
For the three experiments, we report Bayes factors comparing the evidence in
favor of the alternative hypothesis (BF ) or in favor of the null hypothesis (BF )
10 01
depending on which one receives greater support in the Bayesian t tests. For Bayesian
analyses of variance, we report which model showed the best fit to the data compared to
the next best-fitting models until the comparison reaches a Bayes factor of at least 3. In
all cases, BFs between 0.33 and 3 are considered weak evidence, BFs between 3 and 10
are considered moderate evidence, and BFs larger than 10 are considered strong
evidence (Dienes, 2014; Lee & Wagenmakers, 2013).
Experiment 1: Visual WM
Data Preprocessing
Sixty participants completed the experiment in each group. Five of them were
excluded from the analyses because they failed to achieve 95% accuracy in the visual
search task. Another participant was removed because their accuracy in the WM task
was more than 3 standard deviations (SDs) below the group mean, leaving 56
participants in the no-load group and 58 participants in the high-load group.

each block. For the high-load group, we found that the size of the cuing effect, i.e., the
difference in the s parameter between conditions, was M = 0.09, 95% Confidence
Interval (CI) [0.06, 0.11]. This effect is significantly different from zero in the
frequentist t test, t(57) = 6.49, p < .001, and provides strong support for the alternative
hypothesis in the Bayesian t test, BF = 5.80 × 10 . For the no-load group, the size of
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 22
cuing effect was M = 0.08, 95% CI [0.06, 0.11], which is also significantly different
from zero, t(55) = 6.03, p < .001, BF = 10 These results imply that both groups

developed a search bias towards the rich quadrant that made response times decrease
more rapidly when the target appeared in the rich quadrant than when the target
appeared in any of the sparse quadrants. Contrary to our main hypothesis, we found no
significant differences between the two groups in the size of cuing, t(111.5) = 0.11, p =
.914, BF = 5. This result implies that we do not have evidence that adding a visual
WM task to a probabilistic cuing search task hinders the development of the
probabilistic cuing bias and, in fact, the Bayes factor provides moderate evidence for the
hypothesis that both groups are identical.
For the testing stage, the probabilistic cuing effect was defined as the difference
between the mean RT in the rich condition and the mean RT in the sparse condition,
collapsing data from all blocks. We found that for the high-load group the cuing effect
was M = 80.97 ms, 95% CI [35.61, 126.33], and significantly different from zero, t(57)
= 3.57, p < .001, BF = 36.28. For the no-load group the cuing effect was M = 70.51
ms, 95% CI [25.94, 115.08], and this result was also significantly different from zero,
t(55) = 3.17, p = .002, BF = 12.15. We did not find significant evidence that size of
probabilistic cuing differed across groups, t(112), p = .742, and the Bayes factor
provides moderate evidence for the hypothesis that both groups have equivalent
probabilistic cuing, BF = 4.79.

Visual Search Accuracy
The 2 (group: high-load vs. no-load) × 2 (quadrant: rich vs. sparse) × 2 (stage:
learning vs. testing) ANOVA on error rates yielded a Group × Quadrant significant
interaction, F(1,112) = 7.82, p = .006, 𝜂 = 0.07. The best-fitting model in the Bayesian
ANOVA included the main effects of group and quadrant, and the Group × Quadrant
interaction, with a BF of 1.77 over the next model, which only included quadrant, a BF
of 2.11 over the third best-fitting model, which only included group, and a BF of 5.10
over the fourth best-fitting model, which included the main effects of group and
group in the three experiments. In Experiment 1 participants in the no-load group (who
were faster in the visual search task than the high-load group) were not more prone to
errors than the high-load group. Similarly, participants did not perform the task less
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 24
accurately when the target appeared in the rich quadrant (even though they were faster
in that condition) compared to when the target appeared in the sparse quadrant. Thus,
faster responses were not achieved at the expense of accuracy. In general, error rates
show that participants performed the visual search task very well, even in the learning
stage under high WM load.

When asked whether the target had appeared more frequently in a particular

with a mean of 3.86, 95% CI [3.63, 4.09]. The mean probability estimate that the high-
load group assigned to the rich quadrant was M = 25.97%, 95% CI [23.38, 28.55],
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 25
which was not significantly different from 25%, t(57) = 0.75, p = .458, BF = 5.35. The

= .546, BF = 5.75. Finally, we did not find any evidence that both groups differed in
their probability estimates for the rich quadrant, t(111.5) = 0.08, p = .938, and the Bayes
factor revealed moderate evidence for the null hypothesis, BF = 5.02.

Sixty participants completed the experiment in each group. Three participants

Additionally, one participant was removed for having an accuracy more than 3 SDs

stages. For the high-load group, the mean cuing effect, defined as the difference in the s
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 26
parameter, was M = 0.07, 95% CI [0.04, 0.10], which was significantly different from
zero, t(58) = 5.02, p < .001, BF = 3350. For the no-load group the mean cuing effect
was M = 0.06, 95% CI [0.03, 0.08], and also different from zero, t(56) = 4.58, p < .001,
BF = 754. Again, and contrary to our hypothesis, we found no significant difference in
the size of cuing between both groups, t(113.64) = 0.56, p = .577, and the BF indicated
moderate evidence for the null hypothesis, BF = 4.40. These results imply that both
groups acquired an attentional bias towards the rich quadrant that made RT for the rich
quadrant condition decrease more rapidly. Again, there is no evidence that performing
the visual search task during the retention interval of a spatial WM task hindered the
probabilistic cuing effect compared to performing it after the WM task. These analyses
must be interpreted with caution, though. The fact that probabilistic cuing was already
strong by the first block of training in the no-load group obscures the interpretation of
any analysis based on the slope parameter s. Specifically, because both conditions
differed from the very beginning of the learning stage, the discrepancy between their
decline rates underestimates the size of cuing in the no-load group. We return to this
issue later on.
In the testing stage, we found that for the high-load group the mean size of the
cuing effect was M = 66.75 ms, 95% CI [35.61, 97.89], which was significantly
different from zero, t(58) = 4.29, p < .001, BF = 310. The no-load group had a mean
cuing effect of M = 72.99 ms, 95% CI [38.24, 107.64], which was also significantly
different from zero, t(56) = 4.22, p < .001, BF = 242. We did not find a significant
difference between both groups, t(112.3), p < .789, and the Bayes factor indicates
moderate evidence for the null hypothesis, BF = 4.90.

Participants in the high-load group responded correctly in 62.14% of the trials,

In response to the first question, both groups showed a median response of 4
(‘possibly yes’), with a mean of 3.59, 95% CI [3.35, 3.84], for high-load participants
and 3.56, 95% CI [3.33, 3.79], for no-load participants. The mean probability estimate
that the high-load group assigned to the rich quadrant was M = 25.51%, 95% CI [22.72,
28.29], which was not significantly higher than 25%, t(58) = 0.37, p = .716, with
moderate evidence in favor of the null hypothesis, BF = 5.14. The mean probability
estimate for the rich quadrant in the no-load group was M = 26.10%, 95% CI [23.30,
28.91], which was also not different from 25%, t(56)= 0.79, p = .434, BF = 6.59, and,
again, provides moderate support for the null. Finally, we did not find evidence that
both groups differed in their probability estimates for the rich quadrant, t(113.93) = -
0.30, p = .763 , and the Bayes factor revealed moderate evidence for the null hypothesis
of no difference, BF = 4.86.
Experiment 3: Spatiotemporal WM
Data Preprocessing
Forty-four participants in the no-load group and 43 participants in the high-load
group took part in this experiment because, in this case, we reached a Bayes factor
higher than 6 in the crucial test before reaching 60 participants per group. Four
participants failed to respond correctly in 95% of the visual search trials and, thus, were
removed from the analyses. One additional participant was removed because their
accuracy in the WM task was more than three SDs below the mean. The final sample
comprised 39 participants in the high-load group and 43 in the no-load group.

Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 29
Unlike in Experiments 1 and 2, the cuing effect in the high-load group was
numerically small, M = 0.03, 95% CI [-0.00, 0.05], and not significantly different from
zero, t(38) = 1.92, p = .062, although the Bayes factor only provided weak evidence in
null result is possibly an artifact arising from our analysis’ focus on the decay parameter
s. The reason why this parameter is equal in both conditions is not that probabilistic
cuing was absent, but rather that the difference between the rich and sparse conditions
was already present in the first block and the subsequent decline in RTs was similar in
both conditions. Additional, non-registered analysis on RTs reported below confirm this
interpretation. Therefore, the result of this preregistered analysis should not be taken as
evidence that probabilistic cuing did not take place in the high-load group, but rather
that the size of the effect did not grow over the course of the learning stage. In any case,
in the no-load group the mean cuing effect was comparable to the previous experiments,
M = 0.09, 95% CI [0.06, 0.12], and was significantly different from zero, t(42) = 5.65, p

In response to the first question of the awareness test, participants in the high-
load group showed a median of 3 (‘possibly not’), with a mean of 3.33, 95% CI [3.07,
3.59], whereas the no-load showed a median of 4 (‘possibly yes’), with a mean of 3.56,
95% CI [3.21, 3.90]. The mean probability estimates for the rich quadrant in the high-
load group was M = 25.21%, 95% CI [22.89, 27.52], which was not significantly
different from 25%, t(38) = 0.18, p = .858, and provided moderate evidence for the null,
BF = 5.71. The mean probability estimate that the no-load group assigned to the rich
quadrant was M = 27.33%, 95% CI [23.98, 30.67], which was also no significantly
different from 25%, t(42) = 1.40, p = .168, although the Bayes factor suggests that the
evidence for the null is only weak in this case, BF = 2.44. Finally, as in the previous
experiments, we did not find evidence that both groups differed in their probability
estimates for the rich quadrant, t(73.102) = -1.05, p = .296. Once again, the evidence for
the null was weak, though, BF = 2.73.
Secondary Analyses
Influence of WM load on probabilistic cuing across Experiments 1-3
Learning Stage. To further analyze the difference between the high-load and
no-load groups, we collated data from all three experiments in a 3 (experiment: 1-3) × 2
(group: high-load, no-load) between-subjects ANOVA (and its Bayesian equivalent) on
the size of cuing. Only the Group × Experiment interaction was significant, F(2, 306) =
3.84, p = .022, 𝜂 2 = 0.02. The best-fitting model in the Bayesian ANOVA included only
the main effect of experiment, with BF = 1.11 over the next model, which included only
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 32
the main effect of group, BF = 2.84 over the model including both main effects and
their interaction, and BF = 4.74 over the model that included the main effects of
each group and experiment. Therefore, although the Group × Experiment interaction
was significant in the frequentist analysis, the Bayesian ANOVA revealed only weak
evidence against it. In any case, to explore the interaction, we performed three 2
(experiment: 1 vs. 2, 1 vs. 3, and 2 vs. 3) × 2 (group: high-load, no-load) separate
ANOVAs. The Group × Experiment interaction reached significance only in the

evidence, BF = 3.06, for the model including only the main effect of group compared to

the Bayesian ANOVA provides moderate evidence that WM load affected probabilistic

high-load groups achieved lower accuracy in the WM task than those in the no-load
groups, and accuracy in the WM task also tended to be lower in Experiment 2 than in
Relationship between Probabilistic Cuing and Awareness
To maximize statistical power, we explored the relationship between performance
in the probabilistic cuing task and awareness (i.e., probability estimates for the rich
quadrant) collapsing data from the three experiments. The Pearson correlation
coefficient was not significantly different from zero, r = .02, p = .657, and the Bayes
factor analysis revealed moderate evidence for the null hypothesis of no correlation,
BF = 6.87.
Power analysis of Won and Jiang
Only Experiment 3 detected a significant impact of WM load on probabilistic
cuing in the preregistered analyses. The standardized effect size of the crucial effect was
a Cohen’s d = 0.69. Following Equation 8 in Morris and DeShon (2002), we were able
to estimate that if this effect had been tested in a within-participants experiment, the
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 34
standardized size of the difference between the load and no-load conditions would be
between a Cohen’s d = 0.62 and 0.77, assuming correlations from .40 to .60 between
the size of probabilistic cuing in both conditions. The power to detect effects in this
range in a two tailed t-test with α = .05 and N = 18 is between .71 and .87. This means
that the original experiments by Won and Jiang (2015) were reasonably well powered to
detect an effect of WM load on probabilistic cuing like the one observed in our
Experiment 3, at least when assuming correlations from .40 to .60 between the size of
probabilistic cuing in both conditions.
Results of Non-registered Analyses
In the preregistered analyses of the learning stage, WM load seemed to impair
the expression of probabilistic cuing just in Experiment 3, where participants carried out
a spatiotemporal WM task. However, there are reasons to take these analyses with
caution. Firstly, analyses based on learning rates (e.g., the slope parameter s in the
power function) assume that reaction times are similar during the first blocks of trials
and then decrease over training at different rates. Visual inspection of search times
that participants in the high-load group of Experiment 3 showed a robust probabilistic
cuing effect by block 1. A similar effect may be present in the no-load group of
sparse condition in the no-load group is almost flat—what was not expected.
Retrospectively, given these unexpected oddities in our data, we thought that a more
traditional analysis, based on raw RTs, might be more adequate for these data. To that
end, we analyzed RT difference scores (i.e., mean RT in the sparse quadrants minus
mean RT in the rich quadrant) through 2 (group: high-load vs no-load) × 2 (quadrant:
rich vs sparse) Bayesian and frequentist ANOVAs, separately for each experiment. In
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 35
all cases, the crucial effect to detect an impairment in the probabilistic cuing effect due
to WM load is a significant Group × Quadrant interaction.
Experiment 1: Visual WM. For Experiment 1, only group, F(1,112) = 11.09, p
= .001, 𝜂 2 = 0.09, and quadrant, F(1,112) = 181.67, p < .001, 𝜂 2 = 0.62, were
𝑝 𝑝
significant. The Group × Quadrant interaction was not significant, F(1,112) = 0.12, p =
.733, 𝜂 2 = 0.00. Consistent with this, the best-fitting model in the Bayesian ANOVA
was the one that included the main effects of group and quadrant with a BF of 4.96 over
the model that included both factors and the interaction and a BF of 26.46 over the
model that included the quadrant main effect. The size of the probabilistic cuing effect
was 221.07 ms (SD = 158.75) for the high-load group and 210.14 ms (SD = 182.38) for
three experiments.
Experiment 2: Spatial WM. In Experiment 2, the main effect of group was
significant, F(1,114) = 18.83, p < .001, 𝜂 2 = 0.14, and the main effect of quadrant was
significant as well, F(1,114) = 194.53, p < .001, 𝜂 2 = 0.63. In this case, the Group ×
Quadrant interaction was also significant, F(1,114) = 4.59, p = .034, 𝜂 2 = 0.04. The
Bayesian ANOVA indicated that the best-fitting model included both factors and their
interaction, with a BF of 1.45 over the next best-fitting model, which only included the
quadrant and the group factors and a BF of 1,000 over the next best-fitting model that

Discussion
The main aim of this study was to test whether the probabilistic cuing effect is
independent of WM resources. Importantly, in an effort to contribute to the transparency
of science and the replicability of psychological research, this study was conducted as a
Registered Report. This implies that the rationale, hypotheses, methods, and analyses

plan of the three experiments were put forward before data collection began. The
experimental protocol (i.e., the Introduction and Methods of the present article) was
approved by the journal editor and reviewers before any results were available. The
main advantage of this publication format is that the reader can rest assured that the
results reported in the present article are completely free from publication bias, selective
reporting, HARKing, and questionable research practices (e.g., Nosek et al., 2018).
Goal-driven selective attention and WM are assumed to be intimately related
(Awh et al., 2006; Gazzaley & Nobre, 2012). Thus, the question of whether
probabilistic cuing is independent from working memory resources is crucial for any
attempt to find out if the effect relies on goal-driven or habitual processes. In the current
experiments, one group of participants performed a visual search task during the
retention interval of a concurrent WM task (i.e., the high-load group), whereas another
group of participants performed the same visual search task after the WM task (i.e., the
no-load group). The WM task involved the storage and retrieval of visual information in
Experiment 1, spatial information in Experiment 2, and spatiotemporal information in
Experiment 3. We hypothesized that probabilistic cuing would be stronger for the no-
load group compared to the high-load group in all cases. Contrary to our predictions, the
preregistered analyses showed that WM load did not hinder the expression or the
acquisition of the probabilistic cuing effect in Experiments 1 and 2. In Experiment 3, we
detected a significant difference between both groups. However, these results were
found in an analysis based on learning rates which, for reasons explained above, may be
ill-suited to our data. A series of (non-registered) analyses with raw response times
showed no effect of WM load on cuing in Experiment 3. Yet, those analyses revealed a
weak but significant group × quadrant interaction in Experiment 2, showing that spatial
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 38
WM diminished (but did not abolish) the probabilistic cuing bias during the learning
stage. Taken collectively, the evidence available so far, including not only the present
three experiments but also the results from Won and Jiang (2015), suggests that
probabilistic cuing is indeed highly resilient to WM load. At the same time, in
Experiments 2 and 3 we found (admittedly weak) evidence that secondary tasks taxing
spatial and spatiotemporal WM may have a small effect on the size of the attentional
bias, calling into question the hypothesis that the effect is entirely driven by an
automatic attentional habit (Jiang & Sisk, 2018; Jiang, 2019).
In the preregistered protocol, we anticipated that any effect of WM load would
probably be smaller in the first experiment. Our results provide partial support for this
hypothesis, as we found weak signs of dual-task interference in Experiments 2 and 3,
but clearly not in Experiment 1. The difficulty of the task may have been responsible for
this result since in Experiment 2 we found the lowest accuracy in the WM task
compared to the other two experiments, along with most reliable impact of WM load on
the expression of probabilistic cuing.
It is also possible that only a particular component of WM is relevant for the
successful development and expression of probabilistic cuing and that not all the WM
tasks used in this series of experiments are equally effective at taxing that component.
The secondary task used in Experiment 2 might have been particularly effective at
draining any cognitive resource required for the processing of spatial representations.
Note, in any case, that the conclusion that only certain types of secondary tasks interfere
with probabilistic cuing is based on a cross-experimental comparison. Future research
should compare the impact of different types of WM load within a single experiment.
In the preregistered protocol, we hypothesized that one of the reasons why Won
and Jiang (2015) may have failed to detect differences between WM load conditions
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 39
could be that their sample sizes were perhaps not sufficiently large to reach acceptable
power levels. However, in retrospect, we found little support for this assumption. We
estimate that the statistical power of Won and Jiang to detect and effect like the one
found in our Experiment 3 would be somewhere between .71 and .87, which is a very
reasonable power level. Thus, we can only speculate that other factors, possibly related
to the experimental design, must be responsible for the discrepancy between our results
and theirs.
In the three experiments, the high-load group showed systematically lower
performance in the WM task compared to the no-load group. That is, the visual search
task interfered with the WM task when performed during the retention interval. This
result was expected, since it is a well-established result that performing a secondary task
during the retention interval impairs WM performance (Smyth, 1996; Awh et al., 1998;
Makovski et al., 2006; Mercer, 2018).
Unlike Won and Jiang (2015), our experiments included a testing stage without
any secondary task at the end of the experiment. This allowed us to test the (yet
unexplored) possibility that the attentional bias that underlies the probabilistic cuing
effect could be latently learned under WM load, even if its expression is completely or
partially compromised by the secondary task. Our results did not show a clear effect of
group (that is, WM load) on reaction times during the test stage, suggesting that by the
time they began that stage, both groups had already reached the same learning of the
biased distribution of targets. The safest conclusion that can be drawn from our results
is that WM load does not prevent the acquisition of probabilistic cuing and, if anything,
it might hinder the expression of the learned bias. This result dovetails with previous
research on contextual cuing of visual search, a related visual statistical learning effect
(Goujon et al., 2015; Pollmann, 2019; but see Vicente-Conesa et al., 2022).
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 40
Regardless of the role played by WM resources, another argument for claiming
that probabilistic cuing is an automatic attentional habit is that participants seem to
show little or no awareness of the experimental manipulation that drives their
performance in the task (Jiang, 2018; Jiang et al., 2015; Jiang & Sisk, 2019). Although
our experiments were not primarily aimed at addressing this question, they did include a
brief awareness test at the end of the task for exploratory purposes. We did not find
convincing evidence of awareness about the biased distribution of the target and the
correlation between the performance of participants during the test stage and their
estimates of the frequency for the rich quadrant was nonsignificant either. The poor
evidence of awareness in our experiments was not completely unexpected, though, since
participants performed the awareness test right after the testing stage, once the bias in
the spatial distribution of targets had already disappeared. Ideally, awareness about the
experimental manipulation should be evaluated as close as possible to the moment
where the manipulation is taking place (Shanks & St. John, 1994). In a previous
experiment using the same paradigm we showed that participants performed better in
the awareness test if it was conducted right after the training stage as compared to a
condition in which, as in the present experiments, it was conducted after the test stage
(Giménez-Fernández et al., 2020; Vadillo et al., 2020). The absence of correlation
between probabilistic cuing and awareness was not unexpected either, because these
dependent measures are notoriously unreliable (Vadillo et al., 2020, 2021).
To sum up, probabilistic cuing has been proposed to represent an attentional
habit because it is gradual, implicit, persistent, viewer-centered, transferable only to
other serial search tasks, and insensitive to working memory load. Previous studies
carried out by some of us showed no evidence that probabilistic cuing is implicit,
persistent or gradual (Giménez-Fernández et al., 2020, 2021, Vadillo et al., 2020). In
Probabilistic Cuing and Working Memory 41
contrast, in the present study we confirmed that probabilistic cuing is not easily
hindered by a WM task, although we found some evidence that the expression of this
attentional bias might depend on spatial WM resources. Thus, these results suggest that
it might be premature to rule out that probabilistic cuing is completely independent of
WM.
