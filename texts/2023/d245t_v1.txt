Abstract
Group decision-making and group affiliation are typically addressed as separate research
topics. Our research combines these two areas to comprehend how group membership
impacts the processing and updating of information during collective decisions. We used
a minimal group paradigm to establish three levels of group affiliation (first-level in-group,
second-level in-group, and out-group). Participants in two pre-registered online studies
made majority vote group decisions within these three groups, as well as solo decisions.
In the first study, participants (N = 380) performed a learning task, selecting between two
gambles. In the second study, participants (N = 300) completed a perceptual task where
they judged the direction of moving dots twice. We were thus able to assess how initial
group decisions influenced information updating in response to new information. We
observed general effects of group decisions, irrespective of group affiliation: Recent
events had a lesser impact on information processing (Experiment 1) and updating
(Experiment 2) in group decisions than in solo decisions. Regarding the effects of group
affiliation, participants tended to rely more on in-group judgments than on out-group
judgments only under conditions of uncertainty. These findings further the understanding
of the mechanisms by which groups influence information and misinformation processing.

Introduction
People learn and update their knowledge about the world through the decisions they
make and the feedback they receive. These decisions are often influenced by or made
with other people. Studies addressing how decisions are influenced by other people’s
decisions1–6 underscore the importance of observational learning: Individuals learn to
maximize rewards by observing others2, although how much they benefit depends on
their beliefs about the others’ competence6 and the level of trust placed in them4. There
has, however, been less exploration of how people process and update information when
making decisions with others—that is, in collective decision-making.
Collective decisions can take several forms, including consensual decisions, deliberative
discussions, or voting decisions that follow initial decisions made either independently or
in interaction with the group; individuals may or may not know about the other group
members. In all cases, group decisions are associated with reduced control and
responsibility7, which may be reflected in the cognitive mechanisms underlying decision-
making8,9. Indeed, research has demonstrated that reduced control and responsibility
influence learning8 by diminishing reward prediction errors10. Furthermore, participants
sharing responsibility in a group decision give less consideration to outcomes9. As a
result, they may tend to adhere to initial group choices, which may in turn promote
confirmation bias11,12 through a shift in information updating that favors the group decision
over new evidence.
In this article, we examine how making decisions with others influences the processing
and updating of information. We focus on majority vote group decisions, an important
form of collective decisions that do not involve discussions. In this controlled setting, we
were able to isolate the effects of group affiliation—specifically, individuals’ sense of
belonging to the groups in which they collectively make decisions. People have a
tendency to favor and affiliate with their group members, even when group formation
follows arbitrary criteria13,14: In-group members are generally perceived as more
trustworthy than out-group members15. This tendency may heighten individuals’ reliance
on their groups when learning and updating their knowledge about the world, leading to
increased alignment with in-group members as well as greater commitment to initial
choices and confirmation bias. Given that individuals typically feel little affiliation with the
out-group and can, by extension, be expected to maintain a higher sense of responsibility
for their decisions in this context, learning with out-group members may protect against
the effects of reduced responsibility, and the subsequent decrease in consideration of
outcomes8,9. Consequently, group decision-making with out-group members might elicit
behaviors similar to those observed in solo decision-making.
We conducted two pre-registered studies to address our two primary questions: (1) how
group decisions influence information processing and updating, and (2) the role of group
affiliation in this influence. In the first study, we used a reinforcement learning task to
compare decisions made alone vs in groups (Experiment 1). The second study employed
a two-step perceptual task to measure confirmation bias in decisions made alone vs in
groups (Experiment 2). In both experiments, group members operated independently of
one another. In the group decision conditions, rewards were based on a majority vote of
decisions made asynchronously.
We hypothesized that, relative to participants making decisions alone, participants
making majority vote decisions in a group would give less consideration to decision
outcomes, resulting in poorer performance in the learning task (Hypothesis 1a,
Experiment 1). We further expected that commitment to group decisions would increase
confirmation bias in the updating of information (Hypothesis 2a, Experiment 2). Regarding
group affiliation, we predicted that higher affiliation (from close in-group to more distant
in-group to out-group) would increase alignment with the group decision (Hypothesis 1b,
Experiment 1) and confirmation bias (Hypothesis 2b, Experiment 2). Additionally, we
hypothesized that learning with the out-group may resemble learning alone due to lack of
affiliation with the group (Hypothesis 1c, Experiment 1). Since experiments 1 and 2 were
Results
How group vs solo decisions influence information processing and updating.
We started by examining changes in information processing and updating when decisions
were made in a group—irrespective of affiliation—as compared to alone (Hypotheses 1a
and 2a).
Experiment 1: Influence of group decision-making on learning
Performance increased from the first to second part of the experiment (i.e., first two
experimental blocks vs last two experimental blocks) in all four conditions, demonstrating
96 that participants learned the associations between gambles and outcomes (all t > 5.65,
(341)
individual performance was higher when they decided alone than when they were part of
99 a group (Part 1 t = 4.98, p < 0.001, μ = 0.06 ± 0.22, ci = [0.037, 0.085], dz = 0.26; Part 2
(341)
100 t = 4.06, p < 0.001, μ = 0.05 ± 0.23, ci = [0.026, 0.075], dz = 0.21). However, although the
(341)
individual choices contributing to group decisions were still worse than solo decisions in
Part 2, the group’s performance was higher in this part (Group vs Alone in Part 2
(341)
this was not due to higher individual performance of the selected group members, as
there were no differences in individual performance between participants and the two
other members of the group (all p > 0.39, all t < 0.84).
To examine switching behavior, we calculated the percentage of times participants
switched gambles after negative or positive outcomes. We observed the classical lose–
switch, win–stay effect, with higher percentage of switching after negative vs positive
111 outcomes both when participants decided on their own (t = 18.2, p < 0.001,
(341)
112 μ = 0.20 ± 0.20, ci = [0.18, 0.22], dz = 1) and when they were in the majority of their group
113 (t = 18.7, p < 0.001, μ = 0.1587 ± 0.1566, ci = [0.14, 0.17], dz = 1). As expected, when the
(341)
114 participant was in the minority, the effect was reversed (t = −4.65, p < 0.001,
(326)
115 μ = −0.11 ± 0.44, ci = [−0.16,−0.0656], dz = −0.25); here, negative outcomes from the group
decision would suggest to the participant to repeat their choice, while positive outcomes
in switching behavior between negative and positive outcomes was larger for solo than
119 for majority group decisions (t = 3.82, p < 0.001, μ = 0.0449 ± 0.2172, ci = [0.02, 0.068],
(341)
120 dz = 0.20), suggesting that—consistent with Hypothesis 1a—being in a group leads to
participants giving less consideration to outcomes.
In line with the behavioral findings, computational results indicated that participants took
less account of outcomes when deciding in groups than deciding solo. Indeed, using a
reinforcement learning model with two learning rates, one for solo decisions (𝛼 ) and
𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑜
one for group decisions (𝛼 ), we found that the former was significantly higher than the
𝑔𝑟
(341)
panel).
Importantly, when we accounted for model complexity, a model including two inverse-
temperature parameters (𝛽) for solo and group decisions separately did not explain the
data better. Using a Bayesian model selection approach (see Methods) to compare the
two models, we found that the average posterior probability (PP; i.e., the average
probability of a participant belonging to each model) was higher for the model with one 𝛽
(PP = 0.99 ± 0.10) than for the model with two 𝛽 (PP = 0.01 ± 0.10). Note that in all
models introduced below, the one-𝛽 versions explained the data better than the multiple-
𝛽 versions (see Methods).
We also found that participants updated their expectations less when they were in the
a model distinguishing majority and minority decisions, the learning rate for solo decisions
was, as expected, higher than the learning rates for either majority (t = 5.04,
(341)
p < 0.001, μ = 0.10 ± 0.37, ci = [0.06, 0.14], dz = 0.27) or minority decisions
(𝛼 = 0.16 ± 0.02, t = 7.01, p < 0.001, μ = 0.16 ± 0.42, ci = [0.11, 0.20], dz = 0.38).

ci = [0.02, 0.09], dz = 0.18).
Experiment 2: Influence of group decision-making on confirmation bias
We first tested participants’ basic comprehension of the perceptual task. Results
confirmed that they took both stimuli into account when performing the continuous
estimation: The ratings were most shifted toward the right end of the scale when both
stimuli contained dots moving to the right (RR), then when the second stimulus had dots
moving to the right (while the first had dots moving to the left LR, difference from RR
150 t = 12.76, p < 0.001, μ = 0.353 ± 0.466, ci = [0.29, 0.40], dz = 0.76), then when the second
(283)
stimulus had dots moving to the left (while the first had dots moving to the right RL,
152 difference from LR t = 15.28, p < 0.001, μ = 0.63 ± 0.69, ci = [0.55, 0.71], dz = 0.91).
(283)
Finally, the ratings were most shifted toward the left end of the scale when both stimuli
154 contained dots moving to the left (t = 13.08, p < 0.001, μ = 0.36 ± 0.46, ci = [0.30, 0.41],
(283)
with the second stimulus having more weight in the final estimation.
We now turn to our variable of interest: confirmation bias. Did the ratings for the same
stimuli combinations differ depending on whether or not the participant had made a choice
after observing Stimulus 1? We calculated this bias as the shift in rating after a group or
solo choice vs no choice. Concerning the group’s choices, we isolated trials where the
participant’s choice matched the group’s choice, i.e., when they were in the majority, as
we are interested in the confirmation of choice. A confirmation bias was observed for both
164 solo (t = 10.48, p < 0.001, μ = 0.22 ± 0.36, ci = [0.18,0.26], d = 0.61) and group decisions
(283)
165 (t = 13.65, p < 0.001, μ = 0.28 ± 0.34, ci = [0.24, 0.32], d = 0.82). It was, as predicted
(283)
(Hypothesis 2a), stronger for choices confirmed by the group than for solo choices
(283)
were also confirmed when computing confirmation bias based on stimulus congruency
with choice (see methods). Indeed, a confirmation bias would imply that participants
would shift their ratings toward the direction of the second stimulus when it is congruent
171 with their previous choice. This was the case for both the solo (t = 11.86, p < 0.001,
(257)
172 μ = 0.59 ± 0.80, ci = [0.49,0.69], d = 0.73) and group decisions(t = 16.31, p < 0.001,
(273)
173 μ = 0.75 ± 0.84, ci = [0.69,0.88], d = 0.89). Moreover, this confirmation bias was stronger for
174 choices confirmed by the group than for solo choice (t = 4.59, p < 0.001, μ = 0.19 ± 0.69,
(255)
175 ci = [0.11,0.28], d = 0.27), further supporting Hypothesis 2a.
Interim summary
Participants were less sensitive to recent outcomes when they made decisions in groups
than alone (Hypothesis 1a, Experiment1) and they showed stronger confirmation bias for
group choices than for individual choices (Hypothesis 2a, Experiment 2).
How group affiliation influences information processing and updating.
We now turn to the specific effects of group affiliation. Group affiliation was manipulated
by creating three types of groups: (1) In-Group 1 consisting of people from the same
country as the participant who also shared a painting preference, (2) In-Group 2
consisting of people from the same country as the participant who did not share a painting
preference, and (3) Out-Group consisting of people from a different country. We verified
that participants were sensitive to this manipulation by assessing their fusion and
identification with each group. In both experiments, we found significant linear effects on
both measures. Participants felt most fusion with In-group 1, then In-group 2 (difference

Experiments 1 and 2?
Experiment 1: Influence of group decision-making on performance in a learning task
Conformity to the group decision (Hypothesis 1b):
To assess whether participants were more likely to “copy” the decisions of groups they
identified more strongly with (alignment to group decision), we looked at the percentage
repetitions of the previous group choice, independently of outcomes and whether they
agreed or disagreed with the group decision. In the first part of the experiment,
participants indeed aligned most with In-Group 1, then In-Group 2 (difference between
208 IG1 and IG2 t = 2.03, p = 0.04, μ = 0.025 ± 0.23, ci = [0.0009,0.05], dz = 0.10), then the

choices of the people in their in-group while they were still exploring and learning about
the environment.
Win–stay, lose–shift effects based on group affiliation (Hypothesis 2b)
To test whether switching behavior changed as a function of group affiliation, we
calculated the difference between switching after negative vs positive outcomes for each
group condition. Again, we isolated trials where participants were in the group majority.
This analysis revealed that the difference in switching behavior between negative and
positive outcomes was larger in the Out-Group than in either In-Group, but only in the
223 second part of the experiment (t = 3.39, p < 0.001, μ = 0.0673 ± 0.35, ci = [0.02,0.10],
(330)

We derived two new reinforcement learning models to assess how learning mechanisms
were impacted by group affiliation: Model 3 has four learning rates 𝛼 , 𝛼 , 𝛼 , and
𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑜 𝑖𝑔1 𝑖𝑔2
𝛼 , whereas Model 4 considers the two in-groups together, using a single learning rate

When the learning rates for the two in-groups and the out-group were considered
separately (Model 3), we found no statistical difference between the three groups (𝛼

task
Contrary to our prediction (Hypothesis 2b), we did not observe any difference in

was stronger for choices confirmed by the in-group than for choices confirmed by the out-
250 group, but only when coherence of the stimuli was low (difficult condition) (t = 2.11,
(283)
251 p = 0.03, μ = 0.05 ± 0.41, ci = [0.003,0.099], dz = 0.12; interaction t = 2.4, p = 0.01,
(283)
played a role only when there was uncertainty about the information update.
No differences were observed between groups with the confirmation bias calculation
based on congruency (all p > 0.17, all t < 1.35). There were also no differences between
the in-group and out-group in both the easy and difficult condition (p>0.42, t>0.8).
Interim summary
Group affiliation influenced decisions when the information to be processed was more
uncertain. Under uncertainty, the decision of the in-group was weighted more heavily than
that of the out-group in both experiments, as seen in the increased alignment with in-
group decisions during the exploration phase in Experiment 1 (Hypothesis 1b was
confirmed only under uncertainty) and the stronger confirmation bias when the task was
more difficult in Experiment 2 (Hypothesis 2b confirmed only when the information to be
integrated was more uncertain, although this result was not replicated with the
confirmation bias calculation based on congruency). Independent of uncertainty, in
Experiment 1, learning with the out-group was more akin to learning alone than was
learning with an in-group (Hypothesis 1c).
Discussion
We conducted two pre-registered experiments to investigate how group decisions
influence information processing and updating. First, we observed that participants who
made decisions in a group were less sensitive to recent events than were those who
made decisions alone. Specifically, (1) making a decision in a group reduced the
consideration of new decision outcomes in a learning task, and (2) commitment to a
validated group decision resulted in reduced consideration of new information that
provided evidence to the contrary. Secondly, although subjective feelings of belonging
and affiliation differed across the groups, group membership did not have the anticipated
unconditional effect on information processing and updating. However, effects of
affiliation did emerge under conditions of uncertainty: When the information to be
processed was more uncertain, (1) alignment with previous group decisions increased
with group affiliation during the exploration phase of the learning task and (2) confirmation
bias was stronger for choices validated by the in-group than the out-group. Finally, the
reduced sensitivity to outcomes was more pronounced for the in-group than for the out-
group, supporting the idea that the effect of shared responsibility in groups leading to
diminished consideration of outcomes may be stronger when group affiliation is high and
weaker when it is low.
Consistent with Hypothesis 1a, our findings revealed that—relative to solo decisions—
learning through decisions made in groups of three resulted in a decreased learning rate
and fewer switches of responses based on outcome valence. This result aligns with the
notion that responsibility for decision outcomes is shared in group decisions7, and that
the reduced personal control over choices may lead to a decrease in the consideration of
outcomes. Similar results have been observed when people did gambling decisions in
groups9. The perception of outcomes is known to be influenced by whether or not people
feel they have control over their choices8,10,24,25. Sharing responsibility with others in
group decisions may represent a middle ground between having full control and having
no control, and result in less processing of outcomes than in situations where individuals
have full control over their choices26.
Observational learning has been shown to enhance individual performance2. Individual
performance might therefore be expected to increase in the second part of the
experiment, when participants have received feedback on others’ decisions and their
outcomes. However, reduced outcome processing in groups was accompanied by lower
individual performance in the learning task during both the initial exploration phase and
the subsequent phase.
Importantly, despite the decrease in individual performance within groups, overall group
performance remained superior to solo performance throughout the task. This difference
was not attributable to better performance by other group members, which was controlled
for in the experimental design. This finding suggests that typical wisdom-of-the-crowd
effects, whereby group decisions outperform the most accurate individual decision27,
outweigh the decrease in individual performance when people know that their decision
will be pooled in a group decision. This distinction from observational learning is
noteworthy; a reduction in an individual’s performance within a group does not
compromise the final performance of the group and its outcome, which is what matters
for participants in our case: Participants were rewarded based on the group’s
performance, to which they contributed through the majority vote. Rewarding individuals
based on group rather than individual performance has been shown to enhance collective
decisions28.
Interestingly, previous research has reported discrepancies between individual and group
performance, but in the opposite direction: Communication between group members
reduced the accuracy of a collective decision in an estimation task29, but improved
individual performance30. The reasons for such discrepancies thus seem to depend on
various factors, such as the type of decision (e.g., majority vote or average), the type of
reward (individual or collective), and other contextual factors (e.g., discussion or no
discussion). Future research could characterize these effects more closely.
Our learning task focused on categorical decisions and group decisions based on a
majority vote. Alternative approaches to group decisions, such as assigning a particular
weight to each group member’s decision or basing group rewards on the sum of individual
decision accuracy, might create incentives for individuals to perform better. For instance,
in an educational context, basing group rewards on each student’s individual learning has
been shown to enhance overall student achievement31.
Confirmation bias was significantly higher after group decisions than after solo decisions
(supporting Hypothesis 2a), independent of group affiliation. This finding underscores the
robustness of this effect, indicating that it is not contingent on the proximity to other group
members. In political contexts, partisanship has been shown to impact memory and
perceptual judgments32–34. These findings initially led to the prediction that confirmation
bias would intensify only in groups with strong identification. However, our results
revealed that any choice validated by the group biased future information updating toward
that choice—irrespective of the strength of affiliation to the group. Being in the majority of
a group decision and thereby agreeing with other group members might be sufficient to
trigger a sense of belonging and elicit these effects. Notably, confirmation bias has been
shown to be stronger in groups with homogenous preferences35,36 and further increased
by commitment and confidence36. The impact of confirmation bias on group learning and
performance remains an open question, as we investigated these two aspects in separate
experimental paradigms. It has been suggested that moderate confirmation bias may
enhance individual37 and group performance38 when learning, and that intermittent social
information improves collective problem-solving39. Understanding the conditions under
which group decisions and the associated confirmation biases contribute to accuracy and
learning is an important avenue for future research.
As predicted (Hypothesis 1c), learning rates in the out-group condition were higher than
in the combined in-group conditions, but lower than in the solo condition. Thus, learning
with the out-group appears to fall between learning alone and learning with the in-group,
potentially providing a protective factor against decreased outcome updating when
learning as a group. This effect may be attributable to higher feelings of responsibility in
the out-group than the in-group7. Note that this link is speculative: Feelings of
responsibility were not measured directly. Future experiments including this measure are
planned to confirm the connection between shared responsibility and group affiliation.
Whereas previous studies have compared group decisions with the in-group and out-
group in the context of altruistic40 and ethical41 behaviors, our study is to our knowledge
the first to compare solo, in-group, and out-group learning during collective decisions.
Previous research investigating how social learning is influenced by group identity42–44
has demonstrated that information cascades occur more frequently when people learn
from the in-group than from the out-group42. Additionally, people tend to adopt a copy-
the-in-group social strategy that can lead to inefficient behaviors43. Our findings, together
with these studies on social learning, suggest that information processing may become
less efficient and accurate when exposed to in-group opinions, which may in turn
contribute to phenomena such as the polarization of behaviors observed in online social
media bubbles.
We acknowledge that we did not observe the expected unconditional linear effects of
group affiliation on information processing and updating in our two experiments, including
differences between the two in-groups (as proposed in Hypotheses 1b and 2b). As
discussed earlier, there were consistent differences between group and individual
decisions in both sensitivity to outcomes and confirmation bias, irrespective of group
affiliation. Upon further examination of the data, it became apparent that uncertainty
played a crucial role in the impact of group affiliation on group decisions. In the exploration
phase of the learning task (Experiment 1), where participants were still unfamiliar with the
task environment, their reliance on social information depended on their affiliation with
the group. Greater affiliation was associated with a higher likelihood of repeating the
group’s choice on the next trial. Prior studies have suggested that people tend to exhibit
higher social alignment when their confidence is low3,45,46. Our results extend this finding
by showing that social alignment under uncertainty is modulated by the closeness
individuals feel to groups in a linear manner. This modulation is evident not only in the
distinction between in-group and out-group alignment, but also in the different levels of
alignment across in-groups.
Likewise, in Experiment 2, we observed that confirmation bias was influenced by group
affiliation only when the information to be updated was uncertain. In this context, what
mattered most was whether the decision was validated by the in-group, regardless of
differences in affiliation with the two in-groups. A choice confirmed by an in-group elicited
stronger updating of information in the direction of that choice than did a choice confirmed
by the out-group. These findings suggest that people may specifically tend to change their
beliefs to align with the in-group’s beliefs32–34 when the available information is uncertain.
These two results—the reliance on the group’s choice and the inclination to shift toward
the in-group’s choices under uncertainty—converge to support the notion that social
learning is enhanced under conditions of uncertainty47,48. Notably, we demonstrate that
increased social imitation of the group under uncertainty is contingent on the identity of
the group members. The opinions of in-group members may be particularly influential
because they are perceived as more trustworthy4 and competent6. It has also been
suggested that social information should be favored when the personal information of
group members is reliable49, and in-group members could be indeed perceived as more
reliable. This underscores a potential interaction between two significant motives for
joining groups: seeking higher accuracy and fulfilling normative needs7.
Another type of uncertainty may have played a role in our study, the uncertainty linked to
the lack of full control of individuals on the final decisions in group conditions. This
uncertainty, inherent to any group majority vote decision, was not controlled for in our
experiments and we acknowledge that its effect may overlap the effect of being in a group.
Despite this overlap, our findings suggest that group settings contribute uniquely to
behavioral and learning patterns beyond mere reductions in control. Indeed, we
highlighted differential learning processes when comparing situations where participants
were 'Alone' versus 'in a group majority', which both involved a similar degree of alignment
between individual and group decisions. Furthermore, the differences in learning rates
observed between in-groups versus out-groups conditions, for which the control level is
similar, emphasize that our findings extend beyond control dynamics and may involve
deeper social identity factors. Further experiments, designed to explicitly disentangle the
influences of control from those of group affiliation, could shed light on this issue. For
example, introducing an 'alone' condition in which control is similarly diminished—where
subjects ’decisions are not always realized—would offer a more effective comparison to
group situations.
Our studies employed innovative experimental paradigms to investigate the interplay
between group affiliation and accurate information processing in group decision-making.
We discovered that being in a group, irrespective of affiliation, alters the representation
of the world by reducing belief updating and increasing confirmation bias. These effects
were more pronounced when individuals felt a stronger connection to their group—but
only in situations of uncertainty. We believe that our approach contributes to a better
understanding of group behaviors in processing and updating information. These insights
are particularly relevant in the context of digital media consumption, the spread of
misinformation, and their effects on democracies50.
Methods
Ethical approval
Both experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Max Planck Institute for
Human Development and conducted in accordance with ethical regulations. Participants
provided informed online consent by clicking a button to confirm that they agreed with the
study conditions and storage of data.
Participants
In Experiment 1, the learning study, 380 UK participants (190 women, 190 men; mean
age = 38.92 years ±12.40) were recruited on Prolific, using Prolific’s prescreening filters
to achieve a balanced gender sample of UK residents. Participants were paid a fixed rate
of £3.50 for a task taking about 25 min and received an additional bonus based on their
performance in the task. The data of 36 participants were excluded because their overall
performance was less than 60%, and/or they did not provide an answer in more than 10
trials, and/or more than 10 experimental trials were not saved due to server issues. The
data of two further participants were excluded due to a mismatch of gender information
between Prolific and the identification question in our experiment (identified as female in
the male group, male in the female group, or other). For full details of sample size and
were thus used for analysis.
In Experiment 2, the perceptual study, 300 UK participants (150 women, 150 men; mean
age = 36.81 years ±11.93) were recruited on Prolific. Participants were again paid £3.50
for a task taking about 25 min and received an additional bonus based on their
performance in the task. The data of 14 participants were excluded because more than
10 experimental trials were not saved or more than the 80 trials were saved due to server
issues. The data of two participants were again excluded due to a mismatch of gender
information between Prolific and the identification question in our experiment. For full
data of 284 participants were thus used for analysis.
Group affiliation manipulation and group decisions in both experiments
Group affiliation manipulation: At the beginning of the experiments, participants were
grouped with people on Prolific who had previously played the same task individually in
a two-step process: (1) The previous players were split based on their country: UK (In-
Group) vs US (Out-Group), (2) those from the UK were then assigned to In-Group 1 or
In-Group 2 based on their preference between two randomly selected paintings by
Wassily Kandinsky. The previous players in In-Group 1 had the same preference as the
participant; those in In-Group 2 chose the other painting.
Conditions and group decisions: There were four conditions in each experiment:
(1) Alone: decision taken individually, (2) In-Group1 (IG1): decision taken with two other
people from the first in-group, (3) In-Group2 (IG2): decision taken with two other people
from the second in-group, (4) Out-Group (OG): decision taken with two other people from
the out-group. The group decision consisted of a majority vote based on the participant’s
response and the responses of two previous players from the corresponding group who
had completed the same (but individually) learning or perception task. Participants in
group decisions could either be in the majority (same response as the group decision) or
the minority (different response from the group decision) of the group.
Group affiliation checks: Group affiliation checks were run between the experimental
blocks in a random order. First, we assessed fusion16 with the group by asking
participants to pick the picture that best described their relationship with In-Group 1, In-
Group 2, and the Out-Group. The pictures showed seven levels of progressive overlap
between two circles depicting the self and the group, respectively (from no overlap at
all = 0 to complete overlap = 6). Second, we assessed identification17 with the group by
asking participants to rate how strongly they identified with other group members from the
three groups on a continuous scale from 0 to 100, where 0 = not at all and 100 = very
much.
Experimental paradigms
Experiment 1
The first experiment consisted of a probabilistic learning task with monetary gains where
and one with a 25% chance of winning18. Participants were exposed to a different pair of
gambles in each of four group conditions (Alone, In-Group 1, In-Group 2, Out-Group).
They were informed about the group condition before choosing between the two gambles.
They were then shown the gamble chosen by the group (or by themselves if playing
alone), and finally the outcome of that gamble: winning a coin or not.
The four group conditions alternated randomly in each block, with each condition applying
six times per experimental block (four blocks, each condition thus applied in total 24 times
across the experiment). The outcome at each trial could be positive or negative.
Previous players for group decisions: These data were collected from 300 people on
Prolific who had previously played the same learning task individually (205 from the UK:
121 women, 81 men, 3 who identified as other; mean age = 40.65 years ±13.76; 95 from
the US: 63 women, 32 men, mean age = 37.09 years ±15.76). They were asked to pick
between the two paintings to assign them into groups (see group affiliation manipulation
section). They were shown all the 96 trials of the experiment (24 pairs of gambles X 4,
but here all the choices were done individually for the 4 pairs). For each pair of gamble
and group, 10 participants were picked such that the mean performance was 68%
(minimum 62%; maximum 75%). Two of these 10 participants were then picked randomly
for each participant in the collective experiment.
Bonus payment: Participants received a bonus based on their earnings in the experiment,
with the total number of coins won being converted into pence. For example, a participant
who won 60 coins received a £0.60 bonus.
Experiment 2
The second experiment consisted of a perceptual random dot motion task in which
were two main conditions: No Choice and Choice12.
In the No Choice condition, participants did not have to make a choice after seeing
Stimulus 1. Instead, they simply tapped on a ‘Press’ button located in the middle of the
screen. They thus executed a motor response similar to that involved in the choice task
but without making a choice. After seeing Stimulus 2, participants individually estimated
the average direction of the dots in Stimulus 1 and Stimulus 2 on a continuous scale.
In the Choice condition, participants saw Stimulus 1 and made a categorical
discrimination on whether the dots were moving to the right or the left. Participants in
groups were then shown the majority vote. As in the No Choice condition, after seeing
Stimulus 2, participants individually estimated the average direction of the dots in
Stimulus 1 and Stimulus 2 on a continuous scale. The Choice condition was presented in
each of the four group conditions (Alone, In-Group1, In-Group2, Out-Group).
We varied the difficulty of the trials in Stimulus 2 by implementing two levels of coherence.
In high-difficulty trials, coherence was 0.2 (i.e., 20% of the dots were moving to the right
or left; the rest moved around at random). In low-difficulty trials, coherence was 0.4 (i.e.,
40% of the dots were moving to the right or left and the rest at random).
We also varied congruence between the two stimuli (No choice condition) or the choice
and the second stimulus (Choice condition), that is, whether the dots were moving in the
same (congruent) or opposite (incongruent) directions in Stimuli 1 and 2 (No Choice
condition) or whether the participant’s choice for Stimulus 1 was or was not congruent
with the direction of the dots in Stimulus 2 (Choice condition).
The experiment consisted of 80 trials: two sets of the same 40 randomized trials (8 No
Choice condition trials and 32 Choice condition trials). Trials were counterbalanced as
The conditions were randomly alternated across four experimental blocks (of 20 trials
each).
Previous players for group decisions: These data were collected from 103 people on
Prolific who had previously played the same perception task individually (73 from the UK:
34 women, 37 men, 2 who identified as other; mean age = 38.75 years ±12.016; 30 from
the US: 18 women, 11 men, 1 who identified as other; mean age = 38.06 years ±11.78).
They were asked to pick between the two paintings to assign them into groups (see group
affiliation manipulation section). They were shown all the 80 trials of the experiment
individually and not as a group). For each stimulus direction and group, 10 participants
were picked such that the mean performance was around 75% to form groups with similar
performance scores. Two of these 10 participants were then picked randomly for each
participant in the collective experiment.
Bonus payment: Participants were told that one experimental trial would be randomly
picked and that they would receive a bonus based on their performance in that trial.
Participants received a bonus of £0.20 if the perceptual decision in the trial picked was
correct. If it was a group condition, the bonus was based on the group decision.
Individual differences and questionnaires
In the pre-registration, we hypothesized in the exploratory analysis that group behaviors
in both experiments may differ depending on participants’ gender and political attitudes.
Before the start of the experiments, participants completed three measures: the Cognitive
Reflection Task (a measure of cognitive style19 capturing individual differences in
reflexivity, which may help to minimize partisan reasoning20), a measure of political
engagement21 (assessing the extent to which much participants were engaged in political
issues and associations), and a Left–Right ideology scale21, from which we extracted a
political extremism measure, grouping together those who identified as very much on the
left or right (higher quartile to the left or right) vs those who were moderate/central in their
political affiliation.
Contrary to our predictions, there were no effects of these individual differences in either
experiment. These results are reported in the supplementary materials.
Analyses
We ran two sets of analyses, examining: (1) the general effects of making decisions in
groups vs alone, where we collapsed the group conditions into one and compared that
with solo decisions; (2) the effects of group affiliation, where we compared the three group
conditions: In-Group 1, In-Group 2, and Out-Group. We also ran a set of analyses with
In-Group 1 and In-Group 2 collapsed into a single condition ‘In-Group’, which we
compared with out-group and solo decisions.
We report the mean of the effect μ across participants, confidence intervals of the effects,
and effect sizes (Cohen’s d for matched pairs t-tests).
Experiment 1
We focused on three dependent variables:
(1) Performance: % of choices of the highest-probability gamble. Here, we calculated the
individual’s performance from their choices, and the group’s performance from the
majority vote outcome.
(2) Alignment: % of times participants picked the same gamble as the group.
(3) Switching behavior: % switches from one gamble to the other within one pair based
on positive/negative outcomes.
Because this is a learning task, and behavior may change over time as participants learn
about the associations between gambles and outcomes, we analyzed the data separately
for the initial exploration phase (Part 1, first two experimental blocks) and the subsequent
phase (Part 2, last two experimental blocks) of the experiment.
Modeling
We fitted participants' behaviors with four variants of the Q-learning model22 to assess
learning mechanisms in the task. Of particular interest was the relationships of the
learning rate to the group affiliations, to the status of the decision (majority vs. minority),
and to the overall choice condition (solo vs. group).
In the Q-learning model, Q-values are updated at each trial:
𝑡+1 𝑡 𝑡
589 𝑄 = 𝑄 + 𝛼 ∗ 𝑃𝐸 (1)
𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑛 𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑛
𝑡+1 𝑡
where 𝑄 is the updated value of the chosen option at the end of the trial 𝑡, 𝑄
𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑛 𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑛
is the value of the chosen option at the beginning of trial 𝑡, 𝛼 is the learning rate, and 𝑃𝐸
is the prediction error at time 𝑡, computed as:
𝑡 𝑡 𝑡
593 𝑃𝐸 = 𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 − 𝑄 (2)
𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑛 𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑛
The first model aimed at distinguishing how subjects accounted for new information (i.e.,
decision outcomes) in solo vs group decisions. We thus used two learning rates to update
participants’ expectations throughout the experiment such that values in the solo
condition are updated thus:
𝑡+1 𝑡 𝑡
598 𝑄 = 𝑄 + 𝛼 ∗ 𝑃𝐸 (3)
𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑛 𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑛 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑜
while values in the group conditions are updated thus:
𝑡+1 𝑡 𝑡
𝑄 = 𝑄 + 𝛼 ∗ 𝑃𝐸 (4)
𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑛 𝑐ℎ𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑛 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝
Equations (3) and (4) are equivalent to equation (1) but with a learning rate that depends
on the type of decision (i.e., solo or group).
Note that in the group conditions, the “chosen” option is the one voted for by the group
and can thus differ from the individual’s choice.
The second model distinguishes between group situations in which participants were in
the majority vs minority by using the learning rates 𝛼 and 𝛼 , respectively. Q-values
𝑚𝑎𝑗 𝑚𝑖𝑛
are updated at each trial according to equation (1) using these conditional learning rates.
The third model includes four learning rates, one for each decision condition 𝛼 , 𝛼 ,
𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑜 𝑖𝑔1
𝛼 and 𝛼 . Updates again follow equation (1).
𝑖𝑔2 𝑜𝑢𝑡
The fourth model is based on the previous one, with the difference that one learning rate
is used for both in-group decisions: 𝛼 . Updates again follow equation (1).
𝑖𝑔
In all models, decisions between options 𝐴 and 𝐵 are made according to a softmax policy,
such that
𝛽∗𝑄
𝑒𝑥𝑝
614 𝑃
= (5)
𝑡 𝑡
𝛽∗𝑄 𝛽∗𝑄
𝑒𝑥𝑝 + 𝑒𝑥𝑝
𝐴 𝐵
is the probability of choosing option 𝐴 over option 𝐵 at trial 𝑡, with 𝛽 the inverse
temperature parameter governing the amount of decision noise (i.e., the higher 𝛽 is, the
less noisy the decision is).
We also fitted to the data the same models with different inverse temperature parameters,
depending on the conditions. For each model, we compared the one-𝛽 version with the
multiple-𝛽 version by comparing their average posterior probabilities computed from the
BIC (see below). All one-𝛽 versions were found to explain the data better than their
Note that for Model 2, 𝛽 cannot follow the learning rates division into 𝛼 and 𝛼 as
𝑚𝑎𝑗 𝑚𝑖𝑛
the majority/minority information is only available later in the trial, after the decision
process.
All Q-values are initialized to the neutral value of 0.5 at the middle of the value range [0:1].
Models were fitted to the data through log-likelihood maximization using the fmincon
function on Matlab®. Parameters were optimized for each participant separately.
For each model and each subject, we computed the BIC value as follows:
𝐵𝐼𝐶 = −2 ∗ 𝑙𝑙 + 𝑑 ∗ 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑁)
𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙
where 𝑙𝑙 is the maximized value of the log-likelihood function, 𝑑 is the number of free
𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙
parameter(s) in the model, and 𝑁 is the sample size. We used individual BICs as an
approximation of the model evidence and fed them into the MBB-VB toolbox23 to perform
random-effect Bayesian model selection for each model space (comparisons of 1𝛽 and
2 𝛽 versions of each model and comparison of Models 3 and 4). We used the estimated
posterior probability of a participant belonging to each model to compare the models’
quality of fit. We also perform a descriptive analysis of the models quality of fit, reported
in the supplementary information.
Experiment 2
To test for a confirmation bias in participants’ judgments, we computed the shift in
continuous estimation after Stimulus 2 between the Choice and No Choice conditions.
We calculated this shift by subtracting participants’ ratings (on a Left-to-Right scale from
0 to 100 initially, z-scored per participant across all conditions) in the Choice condition
from their ratings for the same perceptual information in the No Choice condition. We
took into account the sign of the shifts based on whether the participant chose ‘Left’ or
‘Right’: A shift indicating confirmation bias is positive when the choice was Right, but
negative when the choice was Left. To be able to average those two conditions, we thus
calculated the shift for Right choices as:
Rating(Choice Right) – Rating(No Choice)
And the opposite for Left choices:
Rating(No Choice) – Rating(Choice Left)
Thus, all positive values indicate a shift toward the previous choice (confirmation bias),
and all negative values indicate a shift to the other choice. We calculated this shift for the
four conditions and only for decisions where the participant was in the majority in their
group.
We also tested a different way to compute confirmation bias, this time without considering
the no-choice trial, but taking into account the congruency between the second stimulus
and the choice. Here the reasoning is that confirmation bias should result in shifted ratings
toward a choice that was followed by a congruent as compared to an incongruent stimulus
(for the same perceptual information). Similarly, as above we took into account the
reversed shift on the scale for choices Left and Right:
Separately for Stimulus 1 Right and Stimulus 1 Left:
• For Stimulus 2 Right: Ratings(Congruent=choice right) –
Ratings(Incongruent=choice left)
• For Stimulus 2 Left: -(Ratings(Congruent=choice left) –
Ratings(Incongruent=choice right))
And combined those subtractions to obtain one measure of confirmation bias in each
condition (Alone and the different groups), with positive values indicating larger
confirmation bias through increased consideration in the ratings of perceptual stimuli
confirming one’s choice.
As per our exclusion criteria in the pre-registration, trials where participants spent more
than 10 seconds on the choice task and/or more than 15 seconds on the estimation were
excluded. Note that the results remain similar if we do not apply this exclusion criteria.
