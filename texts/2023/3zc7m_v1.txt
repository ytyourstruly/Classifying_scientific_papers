Prevalence and correlates of Prolonged Grief Disorder 2
Abstract
Background. Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) has recently been included in both the ICD-11 and
DSM-5-TR diagnostic manuals. Studying its prevalence and correlates across cultures is vital for more
effective identification, treatment, and prevention.
Objective. This study aimed to examine prevalence rates of ICD-11-based PGD, in a representative
Slovakian sample in response to deaths of loved ones occurring during the previous year. Further
aims were to examine the factor structure of PGD symptoms and correlates of summed PGD items
scores and PGD “caseness”.
Method. Self-reported data on PGD, depression, anxiety, alcohol use, and descriptive characteristics
were gathered from a representative sample of the Slovak population (N = 319).
Results. Data were gathered from N = 1853 people; 319 participants (17.2%) reported a loss in the
past year. The prevalence of probable PGD among these bereaved participants was 1.99% for recent
losses (<6 months, n = 151) and 7.75% for more distant losses (6-12 months, n = 130). The most
frequently endorsed symptoms included longing/yearning for the deceased, sadness,
denial/unrealness, and difficulty accepting the death. PGD symptoms had a unitary factor structure
which was consistent for subsamples bereaved 1-5 and 6-12 months. The severity of PGD varied with
kinship. Depression and anxiety, but not alcohol misuse, were associated with PGD severity and PGD
caseness.
Conclusions. These findings underscore that a significant group of people develop PGD between 6-12
months following a loss. This emphasizes the need for targeted psychological interventions.

Prevalence and correlates of Prolonged Grief Disorder 3
Highlights
• Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) is newly included in ICD-11 and knowledge about its
prevalence and correlates in the general population is urgently needed.
• In a representative Slovakian sample (N = 1853), 319 people (17.2%) reported a loss during
the past year; 7.75% of people, bereaved 6-12 months earlier, met criteria for ICD-11-based
PGD.
• PGD severity and caseness were associated with kinship (but less strongly with other
sociodemographic and loss characteristics) and with depression and anxiety (but less
strongly with problematic alcohol use).
• At 6-12 months following loss, PGD seems fairly common in the general population and
timely identification and mitigation of PGD is an important public health issue
Prevalence and correlates of Prolonged Grief Disorder 4
1. Introduction
For at least three decades, bereavement researchers have proposed and examined different
sets of criteria to define disordered, unhealthy, or complicated grief (Boelen & Lenferink, 2020;
Lenferink et al., 2021). This work has culminated in the inclusion of criteria for Prolonged Grief
Disorder (PGD) in the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11; World
Health Organisation [WHO], 2019) and slightly different criteria for a similarly named disorder in the
text revised version of the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders
(DSM-5-TR; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2022). PGD is present when, following the death
of a close person, six months (in ICD-11) or 12 months (in DSM-5-TR) earlier, someone experiences
pervasive separation distress (e.g., yearning/longing and/or preoccupation) accompanied by other
symptoms (e.g., difficulties accepting the loss, avoiding loss-related cues); symptoms must be
associated with significant functional impairment and exceed what is considered typical according to
one’s cultural or religious norms.
Two meta-analyses found conditional prevalence rates of 9.8% (Lundorff et al., 2017) and
49% (Djelantik et al., 2020) in people confronted with natural losses and unnatural losses,
respectively. These reviews indicated the pertinence of PGD and the impact of the cause of death on
its emergence. Yet, outcomes must be viewed with caution considering that studies included in these
reviews mostly relied on non-representative samples. Until a few years ago, the few studies that did
examine representative samples (e.g., Kersting et al., 2011; Mizuno et al., 2012) used criteria to
define PGD caseness that differed from ICD-11 and DSM-5-TR. Recently, Rosner et al. (2021)
examined PGD prevalence in a representative sample of the German general population and found
that, among bereaved persons, prevalence rates were 4.2% (ICD-11 criteria) and 3.3% (DSM-5-TR
criteria). Shevlin et al. (2023) reported prevalence rates of ICD-11 PGD in a representative UK sample,
using “strict criteria” (i.e. symptoms scored ≥4, on a 5-point scale with anchors “1=never” to
“5=always”) and “moderate criteria” (i.e. symptoms scored ≥3 on that same scale) and found these
to be 2.4% and 7.9%, respectively.
Prevalence and correlates of Prolonged Grief Disorder 5
It is imperative to further our knowledge about the prevalence of PGD as per ICD-11 and
DSM-5-TR, to inform decision making in bereavement research and care. Studying rates in different
countries is particularly relevant to inform cross-country efforts to study and alleviate the impact of
loss (cf. Rosner et al., 2021). The current study examined prevalence rates of ICD-11-based PGD in a
representative Slovakian sample1, in response to deaths of loved ones occurring during the previous
year. Studying a relatively recently bereaved sample was deemed particularly relevant considering
that elevated PGD symptomatology within the first year of bereavement is strongly predictive of
persistent PGD (Boelen & Lenferink, 2022; Prigerson et al., 2009) and evidence showing that it can be
successfully reduced with psychological interventions (Litz et al., 2014; Reitsma et al., 2023).
Thus, the first aim of this study was to examine prevalence rates of ICD-11-based PGD. In so
doing, we examined rates among people passing the ≥6 months since loss timing criterion and, for
exploratory reasons, more recently (<6 months) bereaved. The second aim was to examine the factor
structure of PGD symptoms. Consistent with prior research (e.g., Lenferink et al., 2022, 2024), we
evaluated the fit of a unitary model (with all symptoms loading on one dimension) and a two-factor
model (representing two separation distress symptoms, and all “accompanying” symptoms as
distinct factors). The third aim was to examine the endorsement rates all PGD symptoms, in order to
enhance our understanding of the performance of each symptom as indicator of PGD (cf. Rosner et
al., 2021; Shevlin et al., 2023). The fourth aim was to examine to what extent summed scores of PGD
items, as well as meeting vs. not meeting criteria for PGD caseness were associated with
sociodemographic and loss-related variables. Based on prior research (e.g., Buur et al., 2024; Burke &
Neimeyer, 2013; Djelantik et al., 2020), we anticipated that higher PGD scores and prevalence rates
would be observed in women (compared to men), people who lost a partner or child (compared to
other relatives), and those confronted with losses due to unnatural (vs. natural) causes. Our fifth and
last aim was to examine associations of PGD scores and caseness with concurrently assessed

depression and anxiety symptoms and alcohol misuse. Based on prior research studying the co-
occurrence of PGD with depression and anxiety (e.g., Komischke-Konnerup et al., 2021) and alcohol
use (e.g., Parasi et al., 2019), we expected that significant positive associations would emerge.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants and procedure
Data were available from N = 1853 individuals, constituting a representative sample of the
population from Slovakia, participating in a longitudinal, 10-wave study, spanning four years (August
2020 – December 2023) (project APVV-20-0319; Vargová et al., 20232). Data collection was
performed online, by a specialized Slovak agency. Participants were recruited based on quota
characteristics (for gender, age, region, and education). Given the longitudinal design, the
representativeness of the sample slightly diminished over time3. The present study was based on
Wave 9 (summer 2023) data, in which PGD symptoms were assessed for the first time. The study and
data collection adhered to the ethical standards outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and were
approved by the Ethics Committee at the Centre of Social and Psychological Sciences, Slovak
Academy of Sciences. Each participant provided informed consent.
In the total sample (N = 1854), 319 (17.2%) individuals reported a loss during the previous
the bereaved sample were women; the loss usually involved someone other than a partner, child, or
parent and was usually caused by illness.
2.2. Measures
PGD symptoms were examined using items from the Traumatic Grief Inventory-Self Report
Plus (TGI-SR+; Lenferink et al., 2022). The TGI-SR+ is a 22-item measure allowing assessment of

different conceptualizations of PGD (including ICD-11- and DSM-5-TR-based PGD). Respondents rate
the presence of symptoms on five-point scales ranging from 1 = never to 5 = always. To limit
respondent burden, only 13 items were administered, representing 12 symptom-criteria and the
consistency of these items was ω = .96. In keeping with prior research (e.g., Ashouri & Yousefi,
total
2023; Kokou-Kpolou et al., 2022; Lenferink et al., 2024), the cultural deviation item was not included.
Depression symptoms, as designated in DSM-IV (APA, 2000) and DSM-5 (APA, 2013), were
assessed with the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS; Rush et al., 2003).
Participants rated the frequency of symptom (e.g., “Feeling irritable”) during the preceding seven
days on scales with four answer options ranging from 0 through 3. We used the scoring rule from
Rush et al. (2003) meaning that we summed the highest score of the four sleep items, the highest
score of the four appetite/weight items, the highest score of the two psychomotor items, plus the
scores on the remaining six items. Psychometric properties of the QIDS are generally adequate (Reilly
et al., 2015). The omega total coefficient in the present sample was ω = .90.
total
Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7).
This is a seven-item self-report scale developed by Spitzer et al. (2006) as a screening tool and
severity indicator for generalized anxiety, consistent with the core generalized anxiety disorder
criteria as listed in the DSM-IV (APA, 2000) and DSM-5 (APA, 2013). Respondent rate items
(“Worrying too much about different things”) on four-point scale (0 = not at all to 3 = nearly every
day). Research has shown that psychometric properties of the measure are good (e.g., Rutter &
Brown, 2017). Present sample’s internal consistency of the items was ω = .95.
total
The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was used to measure problems
associated with alcohol consumption. It is a 10-item measure, reflecting the ICD-10 (WHO, 1993)
definitions of alcohol dependence and harmful use, developed by the WHO (Babor et al., 1992) that
instructs respondent to rate alcohol use, dependency, and problems on four-point scales with
different anchors. Items can be summed to obtain an index of potentially hazardous alcohol intake.
Prevalence and correlates of Prolonged Grief Disorder 8
The scale has demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties (De Meneses-Gaya et al., 2009).
The omega total coefficient of the items in this study was ω = .94.

2.3. Statistical analyses
Prior to the analyses4, we examined the demographic characteristics of the participants and
patterns of missing data. Overall, 3.8% of the data were missing. This mostly concerned information
about the exact time since loss and AUDIT items for participants who indicated no alcohol use.
Besides these, as few as 0.3% of the data were missing. One participant was excluded, due to too
many missing data (85%) on the PGD measure. The data on PGD and other mental health indicators
were imputed using the chaining random forests algorithm (Stekhoven & Bühlmann, 2012). For our
first aim, to estimate PGD prevalence, participants were considered to meet criteria for PGD caseness
when they had a score of 4 or higher on one of the two separation distress items, one of the
in the study by Lenferink et al. (2022) introducing and examining the TGI-SR+. For exploratory
reasons, we also counted PGD caseness when increasing the number of required accompanying
symptoms from 2+ through 7+ symptoms.5 For the second aim, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)
of the one-factor model, as well as a competing two-factor model (e.g., Ashouri & Yousefi, 2023), was
carried out6. In the one-factor model, the two separation distress symptoms and 10 accompanying
symptoms and 10 accompanying symptoms loaded on two factors. The models were estimated using
the weighted least square mean and variance adjusted (WLSMV) estimator while treating the items
The data used for this study were already cleaned for careless responding patterns and improbable values
based on the combination of improbably fast responding, failed attention checks, multivariate outliers, and
longstrings. The cleaning was done for the purposes of the project APVV-20-0319 (Vargová et al., 2023).
5 Since the introduction of the ICD-11 PGD criteria, researchers have reflected on the number of additional
symptoms required for a PGD-diagnosis, and to what extent this number affects PGD prevalence (see, e.g.,
Boelen & Lenferink, 2020; Eisma et al., 2020). To inform further consideration of this topic, we calculated
prevalence rates for different numbers of additional symptoms.
6 The models included the 12 PGD symptoms. As a supplementary analysis, the models were also estimated
Prevalence and correlates of Prolonged Grief Disorder 9
(scores 1 to 5) as ordinal. The chi-square statistics (e.g., Ropovik et al., 2015) and approximate fit
indices (comparative fit index [CFI], Tucker Lewis Index [TLI], root mean square error of
approximation [RMSEA], and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual [SRMR]7; Hu & Bentler, 1999)
were calculated, and the models’ fit indices were then compared. Subsequently, invariance testing
was performed to ensure that the measurement model operates in the same way across the
subsamples (bereaved <6 months and bereaved ≥6 months earlier; in accord with the timing
criterion). The measurement invariance models sequentially tested configural invariance, metric
invariance, scalar invariance, and strict (means) invariance using the scaled chi-square difference test
(Putnick & Bornstein, 2016).
For the third aim, descriptive statistics were used to count endorsement of individual
symptoms. For the fourth aim, we used chi-square tests, correlations, Welch’s t-tests, and analysis of
variance (including Kruskal-Wallis test as the non-parametric alternative; p-values for multiple
comparisons were adjusted using the Bonferroni-Holm method) to examine if summed PGD scores
were associated with age, gender, education, time since loss, relationship to the lost person, and
cause of death8. Similar tests were used to examine if people meeting caseness vs. not meeting
caseness differed in terms of these variables, in the group of people bereaved 6-12 months earlier.
For the fifth aim, correlations were calculated between the summed PGD items and measures
tapping depression, anxiety, and alcohol use. Finally, t-test were calculated to examine differences in
symptom scores between people meetings vs. not meeting criteria for PGD caseness. As a
supplementary analysis, a regression model (Ordinary Least Squares [OLS]), using all the
aforementioned possible PGD correlates as predictors, was estimated; this is included in the
7 CFI > .95, TLI > .95, RMSEA < .06, and SRMR < .08 were used as the criteria indicating very good model-data fit
(Hu & Bentler, 1999).
8 Age and time since loss were treated as continuous variables, education was treated as an ordered variable,
and gender, kinship, and cause of death were treated as categorical variables.
Prevalence and correlates of Prolonged Grief Disorder 10
3. Results
3.1. PGD prevalence rates
1.99% (95% CI [0.00%, 4.21%]) and 7.75% (95% CI [3.14%, 12.37]) among recently (<6 months, n =
151) and more remotely (≥6 months, n = 130) bereaved participants, respectively. Rates decreased
when increasing the number of additional symptoms from 1+ to 7+. The prevalence rates of probable
PGD were similar for female (6.77%, 95% CI [3.22%, 10.32%]) and male (6.40%, 95% CI [2.11%,
10.69%]) participants.
3.2. Factor structure
218.86, p < .001; CFI = 0.98; TLI = 0.97; RMSEA 0.10; SRMR = 0.05). The two-factor model did not
have a significantly better fit (Δχ²(1) = 2.36, p = .124; differences in other approximate fit indices ≈
.00). Accordingly, we only report measurement invariance testing for the one-factor model. The
invariance testing indicated that the measure achieved metric (Δχ²(11) = 5.86, p = .883), scalar
(Δχ²(11) = 2.64, p = .995), and factor means (Δχ²(1) = 1.09, p = .297) invariance, meaning that the
PGD construct was perceived similarly across the subsample bereaved <6 months and bereaved ≥6
months earlier, allowing for meaningful comparisons of the scores between these subsamples.
3.3. Endorsement rates of PGD symptoms
loss. In both groups, longing/yearning for the deceased, sadness, denial/unrealness, and difficulty
accepting the death were the most frequently endorsed symptoms.
3.4. Correlates of PGD total scores
Correlates of PGD total scores were considered for the whole sample (N = 319). Scores did
not differ significantly between females (M = 26.97, SD = 10.96) and males (M = 24.96, SD = 10.59)
Prevalence and correlates of Prolonged Grief Disorder 11
(t(271.4) = 1.63, p = .105; Cohen’s d = 0.19) and were unrelated with age (r = .03, p = .603) and
education (r = -.04, p = .453). Scores were positive correlated with time since loss (r = .12, p = .048)
and differed by kinship (Kruskal-Wallis(3) = 21.29, p < .001). Scores were lower when the lost person
was some person other than partner, child, or parent (M = 23.89, SD = 9.26), compared to when the
lost person was a partner (M = 38.70, SD = 11.86), a child (M = 44.33, SD = 10.21), or parent (M =
31.16, SD = 12.18) (ps < .001). Scores were also lower when the lost person was a parent compared
to a partner (p = .033) and a child (p = .003). Lastly, scores did not significantly differ by cause of
death (Kruskal-Wallis(3) = 2.46, p = .063) and, as such, were comparable after a loss due to
illness/physical condition (M = 25.98, SD = 10.94), an accident (M = 28.20, SD = 7.22), suicide (M =
40.50, SD = 11.59), or other cause (M = 26.74, SD = 11.44).
3.5. Factors associated with PGD caseness
not meeting criteria for probable PGD caseness. Included were n = 130 who met the timing criterion
for PGD and, thus, were bereaved 6-12 months earlier. Caseness did not differ as per gender (Fisher’s
exact test, p = 1), age (t = 0.37, p = .717), education (χ²(4) = 0.760, p = .944), and cause (χ²(3) = 3.59 p
= .310). Caseness was associated with kinship (χ²(3) = 19.90, p < .001). Specifically, individuals who
lost a partner were more likely to meet the criteria for caseness compared to those who lost a
distant person (p < .001). Likewise, individuals who lost a child also showed a higher likelihood of
caseness compared to those who lost a more distant person (p < .001).
3.6. Associations of PGD scores and PGD caseness with depression, anxiety, and alcohol use
Summed PGD item scores were significantly correlated with depression (r = .43, p < .001)
anxiety (r = .45, p < .001), and alcohol use (r = .23, p = <.001) in the whole sample (N = 319). In the
group of ≥6 months bereaved participants (n = 130), depression scores differed significantly between
those meeting (M = 18.80, SD = 5.96) vs. not meeting (M = 14.18, SD = 4.15) criteria for PGD caseness
(t(9.75) = 2.40, p = .038; Cohen’s d = 1.08). Anxiety scores also differed between those meeting (M =
16.70, SD = 5.36 ) vs. not meeting (M = 11.39, SD = 3.90) criteria for PGD caseness (t(9.82) = 3.07, p =
Prevalence and correlates of Prolonged Grief Disorder 12
.012; Cohen’s d = 1.33) and alcohol use scores did not differ between those meeting (M = 15.33, SD =
4.47) vs. not meeting (M = 14.05, SD = 4.15) criteria for PGD caseness (t(9.31) = 0.83, p = .428;
Cohen’s d = 0.31).
4. Discussion
Considering that PGD was recently included in ICD-11 and DSM-5-TR it seems imperative to
examine prevalence rates and correlates of PGD in different bereaved subgroups and cultures.
Increased knowledge about these issues could inform bereavement research and help to shape
health care policies to improve bereavement care (cf. Ashouri & Yousefi, 2023; Hyland et al., 2024;
Killikelly et al., 2020; Shevlin et al., 2023). The current study examined prevalence rates of ICD-11-
based PGD associated with a loss within the previous year, in a representative sample of the adult
Slovakian population. A first main finding was that prevalence of PGD was 7.75% among those who
passed the 6 months timing criterion. This rate is higher than rates reported by Rosner et al. (2021)
who studied a representative German sample (bereaved 1-911 months earlier) and Shevlin et al.
(2023) examining a UK bereaved sample (bereaved 6 months to 10 years earlier). This is presumably
linked to the fact that their samples included people bereaved longer than one year ago. PGD rates
likely decrease among more remotely bereaved people. Consistent with prior research (e.g., Boelen
& Lenferink, 2020; Rosner et al., 2021), PGD prevalence rates decreased when we increased the
number of required additional symptoms from 1+ to 7+. It still seems that 1+ sets the threshold for
meeting PGD criteria rather low and that it makes sense to reconsider this cut-off point.
Our second main finding was that, in the whole sample as well as the recently (<6 months)
and more remotely bereaved (≥6 months) subsamples considered separately, PGD symptoms formed
a unitary factor. This is consistent with prior research showing that PGD symptoms as defined in ICD-
11 are best described as forming one dimension (Ashouri & Yousefi, 2023; Boelen & Lenferink, 2020;
Kokou-Kpolou et al., 2022; Lenferink et al., 2022, 2024). Notably, some other studies have found
these symptoms to represent two distinguishable dimensions of separation distress and
accompanying symptoms (e.g., Hyland et al., 2024; O’Conner et al., 2023); however, in most of the
Prevalence and correlates of Prolonged Grief Disorder 13
studies examining the dimensionality, both the one- and two-dimensional models evidenced
acceptable fit. Considering individual symptoms, longing/yearning, sadness, denial/unrealness, and
difficulty accepting the death were endorsed most. It is salient that the same symptoms were
endorsed most in Rosner et al.’s (2021) analyses, in people bereaved up to three years ago.
Phenomenologically, these phenomena are at the heart of both healthy and unhealthy grief. By
themselves they are not indicative of disturbed grief per se, but in combination with other
phenomena and when they contribute to suffering and dysfunction they may indicate a grief
disorder.
We also examined correlates of PGD severity and caseness. PGD severity differed as a
function of kinship with higher scores reported by people who lost a partner, child, or parent relative
to people who lost more distant persons. Among those meeting the ≥6 months timing criterion, PGD
caseness was also associated with kinship, with loss of a partner yielding an elevated chance of
meeting criteria for caseness. This is broadly consistent with prior evidence that loosing closer
persons cause more intense reactions (Buur et al., 2024; Burke & Neimeyer, 2013; Djelantik et al.,
2020). We found no evidence that PGD severity and caseness differed as a function of gender, age,
and education. Some other recent studies similarly found no association with gender (e.g., Hyland et
al., 2024; Lenferink et al., 2024). Regarding age, Hyland et al. (2024) observed that increased age was
associated with a lower chance of meeting criteria for PGD in their UK (but not their Irish) sample.
Shevlin et al. (2023) also found older individuals to have lower chance of PGD compared to younger
bereaved counterparts. Inconsistent with our findings, there is quite some evidence that lower
education is associated with higher PGD severity scores (Ashouri & Yousifi, 2023; Buur et al., 2024;
Lenferink et al., 2024). We did not find PGD severity and caseness to differ as a function of cause.
This is particularly notable considering that cause has often been found to be related to bereavement
outcome (Burke & Neimeyer, 2013; Djelantik et al., 2020; Lobb et al., 2010).
Taken together, our findings regarding correlates of PGD severity and caseness are not all
consistent with prior research. This may be due to methodological differences between studies. Most
Prevalence and correlates of Prolonged Grief Disorder 14
notably, some differences may be due to the fact that we studied a relatively recently bereaved
group, whereas prior research included samples with a wider range of time since loss (e.g., Buur et
al., 2024; Shevlin et al., 2023). Both for clinical and research purposes, it is important to be able to
characterize people who are at increased risk of PGD and to be able to do so for people varying in
terms of time elapsed since the loss. Therefore, future research should continue to examine risk
factors and correlates of PGD severity and caseness in different bereaved samples.
Our last aim was to examine associations of PGD severity and caseness with concomitant
symptoms of depression, anxiety, and alcohol misuse. Associations with depression and anxiety
symptoms were moderate and consistent with prior research (e.g., Komischke-Konnerup et al.,
2021). Although associations may be partly due to a common underlying vulnerability for PGD,
depression, and anxiety (e.g., increased neuroticism) findings are important in showing that, already
in the first year of bereavement, PGD symptoms coincide with other aspects of mental ill-health.
Problematic alcohol use had a weak association with PGD severity and did not differ between people
meeting vs. not meeting criteria for PGD caseness. This seems at odds with prior research (Parasi et
al., 2019). Yet, it may be that associations of PGD with alcohol use (and possible other externalizing
problems) are more pronounced in more distressed (e.g., clinical) samples or only manifest later in
time (beyond the first anniversary of the loss). This issue should be addressed further in future
research.
There are several limitations that must be considered. First, data were all gathered with self-
report measures and self-report of PGD symptoms may have led to an overestimation of the
prevalence of PGD (cf. Kramer et al., 2023). More work is needed to examine PGD prevalence, based
on clinical interview-based assessment. Second, we only considered ICD-11-based PGD and not DSM-
TR-based PGD; since criteria and prevalence rates differ between both systems (e.g., Boelen &
Lenferink, 2020; Rosner et al., 2021), the present finding may not necessarily generalize to PGD as
per DSM-5-TR. Third, with the selection of items from the TGI-SR+, we did not measure the extent to
which grief responses deviated from community or cultural norms, which is one of the formal criteria
Prevalence and correlates of Prolonged Grief Disorder 15
of PGD in ICD-11 and is, in fact, included in other measures (e.g., the International Prolonged Grief
Disorder Scale, Killikelly et al., 2020; the International Grief Questionnaire, Hyland et al., 2023).
Fourth, participants had suffered losses up to 12 months ago and findings may not generalize to the
population of people who suffered losses longer. Fifth, the limited sample size, particularly in
subgroup analyses and comparisons, has decreased statistical power necessary to detect smaller
associations between variables considered.
Notwithstanding these considerations, the present study adds to prior evidence that a
significant group of people facing the loss of a loved one develop PGD over the course of the first
year of bereavement. Research shows that increased PGD symptoms, before the first anniversary of a
loss, strongly predicts persistent PGD (Boelen & Lenferink, 2022; Prigerson et al., 2009) but, at the
same time, can be effectively reduced with psychological interventions (Litz et al., 2014; Reitsma et
al., 2023). Thus, it is important to improve options to identify and treat PGD in a timely manner to
avoid unnecessary protracted suffering of people en route toward chronic PGD.
