CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 2
Abstract
The multidimensional forced-choice (MFC) format is an alternative to rating scales in which
participants rank items according to how well the items describe them. Currently, little is
known about how to detect careless responding in MFC data. The aim of this study was to
adapt a number of indices used for rating scales to the MFC format and additionally develop
several new indices that are unique to the MFC format. We applied these indices to a data set
from an online survey (N = 1,169) that included a series of personality questionnaires in the
MFC format. The correlations among the careless responding indices were somewhat lower
than those published for rating scales. Results from a latent profile analysis suggested that the
majority of the sample (about 76 – 84%) did not respond carelessly, though the ones who did
were characterized by different levels of careless responding. In a simulation study, we
simulated different careless responding patterns and varied the overall proportion of
carelessness in the samples. With one exception, the indices worked as intended
conceptually. Taken together, the results suggest that careless responding also plays an
important role in the MFC format. Recommendations on how it can be addressed are
discussed.

Detecting Careless Responding in Multidimensional Forced-Choice Questionnaires
When using self-reports to infer respondents’ trait levels, one concern researchers and
practitioners alike have is that some participants might not have responded accurately and
carefully to some (or even most) items, i.e., data quality might be affected by careless
responding. Alternative response formats to the ubiquitous rating scales, such as the
multidimensional forced-choice (MFC) format, which requires participants to rank multiple
items rather than rate individual items, have been successful in reducing other response biases
such as faking. However, it is currently unclear how to detect careless responding in this
format. The aim of this study was therefore to develop indices to detect careless responding
in the MFC format. In doing so, we took existing indices for rating scales and adapted them
to the MFC format and developed new indices which are unique to the MFC format. Our first
aim was to examine the performance of and correlations among these indices in the MFC
format (Research Question 1). Furthermore, we were interested in whether different types of
careless respondents in MFC questionnaires exist (i.e., different classes in a latent profile
analysis; Research Question 2) as well as in the proportion of the sample that responded
carelessly on the developed indices (Research Question 3) and over the course of the study
(Research Question 4). Moreover, we conducted a simulation study for a conceptual proof of
the developed indices.
In the following, we will give some background on the forced-choice format and
briefly present it as an alternative to rating scales in personality questionnaires. Then, we will
introduce careless responding as a response bias and present methods to detect careless
responding in rating scale data. Next, indices that can be used to detect careless responding in
MFC questionnaires are described. Finally, our research questions and hypotheses are
derived.
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 4
The Multidimensional Forced-Choice Format
In the forced-choice format, two or more items are presented together in blocks.
Participants are then instructed to select the items that describe them most and/or least (partial
ranking) or to rank all items according to how well they describe them (full ranking). The
items within a block can measure the same trait or different traits. The latter is known as the
size and different ranking instructions are described in Wetzel, Frick, and Greiff (2020), for
example. In our study, blocks were multidimensional and we instructed participants to rank
the three items according to how well the items described them in their typical behavior (i.e.,
full ranking of three items representing different traits).
Given the circumstance that items are presented together in blocks, the resulting
rankings are relative. Therefore, applying classical scoring techniques results in ipsative trait
estimates that only allow for intraindividual comparisons (e.g., Hicks, 1970). As
interindividual comparisons are essential in many assessment settings, the use of the MFC
format was limited in the beginning. This limitation was overcome in the past decade with the
development of multidimensional item response theory models that enable obtaining
normative trait estimates and therefore allow drawing interindividual comparisons (see
Brown, 2016, for an overview of these models). One of these models is the Thurstonian item
response theory model (Brown & Maydeu-Olivares, 2011). This model was applied in the
current study because it is suitable for modeling multidimensional item responses to blocks of
three (or more) items. In addition, it is broadly applicable (e.g., to a variety of latent variable
structures or other variants of the forced-choice format) and it can be estimated in available
software, like Mplus (Muthen & Muthen, 2012–2022). This versatility is transparent by its
predominant use in the last few years (e.g., Frick, 2021; Guenole et al., 2016; Lee et al.,
2021; Walton et al., 2020; Watrin et al., 2019; Wetzel & Frick, 2020). When describing the
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 5
indices in detail below, we will briefly delineate some of the model properties that are
relevant for understanding the indices and refer the reader to Brown and Maydeu-Olivares
(2011; 2018) for a deeper understanding of the model.
Careless Responding
In most self-report questionnaires assessing personality traits, participants are
instructed to indicate an intensity. For example, they might be asked to what extent they
agree or disagree with a given item (e.g., “I am often late”) or how often they engaged in a
specific behavior in a given time period. Answers are conventionally measured on a rating
scale with different response options (e.g., from “I strongly agree” to “I strongly disagree”,
or from “never” to “always”). This format is also known as a single-stimulus format because
participants respond to one item at a time.
In the rating scale format, a number of response biases can occur (Paulhus, 1991).
These include, for example, response styles such as a preference for extreme or non-extreme
categories, socially desirable responding (i.e., faking and self-deception), and careless
responding. Careless responding is characterized by selecting response options without
considering the (full) item content (e.g., Nichols et al., 1989). As the expression “careless”
suggests, it is a listless, unmotivated, or uninterested participant behavior that manifests itself
in responses that seem to be arbitrary or indiscriminate. Other terms for the same response
behavior include inattentive (e.g., Maniaci & Rogge, 2014), random (e.g., Credé, 2010), or
insufficient effort (e.g., Huang et al., 2012) responding. Notably, we define careless
responding as a participant behavior which therefore is distinguishable from computer-
generated (i.e., survey bot or automated) responses. The detection of such responses is
described elsewhere (e.g., Dupuis et al., 2019; Teitcher et al., 2015).
Like all response biases, careless responses add noise to the data. Therefore, not
removing careless respondents from the sample can potentially lead to erroneous conclusions.
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 6
Various studies have investigated how different proportions of careless respondents in a
sample can impact the results when using rating scale questionnaires. These studies suggest
that not removing careless respondents can inflate or deflate the correlations between items
(Credé, 2010; Huang et al., 2015), distort the factor structure (Goldammer et al., 2020;
Schmitt & Stuits, 1985), reduce statistical power (Maniaci & Rogge, 2014), or even change
the results of statistical tests (DeSimone & Harms, 2018). Nevertheless, researchers should be
cautious about flagging participants if the construct of interest is associated with careless
responding (e.g., Rios et al., 2017). The base rate of careless responding differs considerably
between samples, applied methods to detect careless responding, and other determinants.
Using factor mixture modeling to detect careless respondents in personality questionnaires,
Arias et al. (2020) flagged between 4–10% in their online samples and Meade and Craig
(2012) flagged between 10–12% in a sample of undergraduate students. In a group
assessment of leadership rankings in a military training, 33% of the recruits were identified as
careless respondents relying on four careless responding indices (Goldammer et al. 2020).
Another characteristic of careless responding is that it increases over the course of the study
(e.g., Bowling et al., 2020; Clark et al., 2003; Galesic & Bosnjak, 2009).
Researchers have developed various methods to detect careless responding in rating
scale data. Meade and Craig (2012) differentiated two types of methods. The first type
comprises special items or scales to detect careless responding. These should be assessed
together with the questionnaires of interest. They include, for example, items asking the
participants to report the quality of their data such as, “Did you expend effort and attention
sufficient to warrant using your responses for this research study?” or items with instructions
on which response category should be chosen, such as “For this query, mark X [insert X] and
move on.” (Abbey & Meloy, 2017, p. 66). The second type consists of indices that can be
computed after data collection is complete. These include analyses of the response time (e.g.,
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 7
extremely fast responses), the inconsistency of the responses (e.g., responding differently to
similar items), response patterns (e.g., choosing the same response option multiple times
consecutively), and on outliers (e.g., responses that deviate strongly from the average
responses of the sample). Curran (2016) and DeSimone et al. (2015) summarized the existing
methods and indices for detecting careless responding in questionnaires using rating scales.
Careless Responding in the Multidimensional Forced-Choice Format
Within a given MFC block, it is only possible to place one item on each rank (see
aforementioned response styles. One of the main reasons why the forced-choice format
gained research interest was to prevent or mitigate faking as one form of socially desirable
responding (e.g., Christiansen et al., 2005). Meta-analytic results from the rating scale and
forced-choice format indicate that responses to personality inventories are less susceptible to
faking in the forced-choice format (Birkeland et al., 2006; Cao & Drasgow, 2019;
Viswesvaran & Ones, 1999). They are even less susceptible to faking when the items within
blocks are matched in terms of their social desirability (Wetzel, Frick, & Brown, 2021).
Unlike the other aforementioned response biases, careless responding cannot be
prevented by the design and characteristics of the MFC format. Whether the occurrence of
careless responding can be reduced by using the MFC format rather than rating scales is an
open research question. To our knowledge, careless responding has not been investigated in
MFC questionnaires. As the design of the forced-choice format differs substantially from
rating scales, some of the methods used to identify careless responding in rating scale data
cannot be applied and others need to be adapted. Hence, little is known about how to identify
careless responding and how often it occurs in questionnaires using the forced-choice format.

Indices for Detecting Careless Responding in MFC Questionnaires
In this study, we focus on the development of indices1 to detect careless responding in
MFC questionnaires. Indices to detect careless responding in the MFC format can be grouped
into two types, following Meade and Craig (2012). First, we implemented special items such
as instructed response triplets and self-report items on data quality together with the
questionnaires in the online study. Second, we adapted and developed post-hoc methods such
as analyses of response time, consistency of the responses (i.e., consistency score), response
patterns (i.e., rank order indices and triplet variance), and outliers (i.e., Mahalanobis
materials for an overview). All of the indices were preregistered together with our research
index and missing values index were not part of the preregistration and are therefore marked
with an asterisk.
Response Time
For each participant, the completion time for each page of the survey was measured.
In addition to this response time measure, we developed a response time index (RTI*)
combining two approaches from the literature: First, some studies that included the response
time to screen for careless responding decided to treat breaks or study interruptions as
missing values (e.g., Meade & Craig, 2012). Second, other studies focused more on detecting
extremely fast responses because some participants respond so quickly that it seems unlikely
that they have really read and considered the item content (Wise & Kong, 2005). Hence,
these researchers used a lower cutoff (e.g., two seconds per item) to screen for careless
respondents (e.g., Bowling et al., 2016; DeSimone & Harms, 2018; Huang et al., 2012). To
1 Currently, model-based approaches to detect careless responding in rating scale data at the item level are
being developed (e.g., Ulitzsch et al., 2021). Even though there are already first implementations for the
forced-choice format (e.g., Peng et al., 2023), we focus on the development of indices that come with the
major advantage that they are easy to use for practitioners.
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 9
combine these two approaches, we extended the response time effort index developed by
Wise and Kong (2005) to include an upper threshold for delayed responses (𝑆 ), yielding
𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟
the RTI for the MFC format. Furthermore, we investigated in a small sample (N = 10) how
much time is needed to respond to a triplet in the MFC format with and without reading the
items (see Appendix A in the supplemental materials). The results revealed that six seconds
per triplet page was an adequate lower threshold (𝑆 ). To calculate the RTI, first, the
𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟
response time 𝑅𝑇 of each participant p on every triplet page t of the questionnaire is
𝑝𝑡
recoded into a categorical variable 𝐶 :
𝑝𝑡
𝑁𝐴 𝑖𝑓 𝑅𝑇 ≥ 𝑆
𝑝𝑡 𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟
𝐶 = { 1 𝑖𝑓 𝑅𝑇 < 𝑆 . (1)
𝑝𝑡 𝑝𝑡 𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟
0 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒
Second, the RTI for each participant is determined as:
∑ 𝐶
𝑡=1 𝑝𝑡
𝑅𝑇𝐼 = , (2)
where k is the number of values of 𝐶 without those coded as missing (NA) and T is the
𝑝𝑡
number of triplets in the questionnaire. As can be seen in Equation 2, a participant’s 𝑅𝑇𝐼 is
the average of 𝐶 , with missing values removed.
𝑝𝑡
Self-Report Items (Meade & Craig, 2012)
At the end of the online survey, participants were asked to evaluate 1) the effort they
put into the study: “I put forth … effort towards this study” (response options: “almost no”,
“very little”, “some”, “quite a bit”, and “a lot of”), 2) the attention they paid to the study: “I
gave this study … attention” (response options: “almost no”, “very little of my”, “some of
my”, “most of my”, and “my full”), and 3) whether their data should be used in the analyses
(use me): “In your honest opinion, should we use your data in our analyses in this study?”
(response options: “yes”, “no”). All three items and instruction sets originated from Meade
and Craig (2012, pp. 441).
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 10
Instructed Response Triplets
In two questionnaires of the online study, an instructed response triplet appeared at a
random position. The items making up these triplets contain instructions in which order to
Consistency Score (Brown & Bartram, 2011)
In the Thurstonian item response theory model, it is assumed that participants’
ranking preferences can be described by their trait levels and item parameters. A consistency
score can be calculated to examine whether participants responded consistently with this
model (Brown & Maydeu-Olivares, 2011). To better explain the consistency score, we will
briefly mention some features of the Thurstonian item response theory model. For a deeper
understanding of the model, we refer the reader to Brown and Maydeu-Olivares (2011;
2018). Before analyzing the data from forced-choice questionnaires, the responses are coded
into binary outcomes of pairwise comparisons. In the case of triplets, three pairwise
comparisons are made: Item 1 with Item 2, Item 1 with Item 3, and Item 2 with Item 3. When
the first item i in the pairwise comparison is preferred over the second item k, the binary
outcome 𝑦 is coded as 1 (else 0). Subsequently, the binary coded outcomes can be analyzed
𝑖,𝑘
using the Thurstonian item response theory model. Based on the parameters originating from
this model, an item characteristic function for each pairwise comparison 𝑦 can be
𝑖,𝑘
computed. The item characteristic function expresses the probability of preferring item i over
item k conditional on the traits measured by the items, 𝜂 and 𝜂 (Brown & Maydeu-
𝑎 𝑏
Olivares, 2011, p. 473):

𝑃(𝑦 = 1|𝜂 , 𝜂 ) = 𝜙 ( ). (3)
𝑖,𝑘 𝑎 𝑏

𝑖 𝑘
However, note that response probabilities for pairwise comparisons involving the same items
are locally dependent given the latent traits. To account for this, in the Thurstonian item
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 11
response theory model the item parameters involving the same items are constrained to the
same absolute value and the item parameters and trait covariances are estimated via limited
information methods. The local dependencies are neglected in the estimation of the person
parameters; however, this has a negligible impact on the estimates' precision according to a
simulation study conducted by Maydeu-Olivares and Brown (2010).
In Equation 3, the parameter 𝛾 is the threshold of the binary outcome 𝑦 , 𝜆 and 𝜆
𝑖,𝑘 𝑖,𝑘 𝑖 𝑘

are the factor loadings, and 𝜓 and 𝜓 the residual variances of the two items involved in the
𝑖 𝑘
pairwise comparison. 𝜙(𝑥) represents the cumulative standard normal distribution function
evaluated at x. When a participant’s responses are in line with his/her expected responses
based on the trait levels, the resulting probabilities are high. In contrast, they are lower when
the observed responses are not in line with the expected ones. The consistency score
expresses the proportion of binary outcomes with a probability higher than chance level
(probability > .5) of being preferred. The higher a participant’s consistency score, the more
consistent his/her response behavior is with his/her latent trait levels. Thus, lower values
could indicate careless responding.
Mahalanobis Distance
A commonly used method to detect outliers, for example on predictors in regression
analysis, is Mahalanobis distance (Mahalanobis, 1936). Mahalanobis distance is the
multivariate generalization of the Euclidian distance between two points. It can be used to
detect values that deviate more from the centroid of all participants in the sample than the
other participants’ values do (e.g., Pituch & Stevens, 2015). Thus, Mahalanobis distance
expresses the distance between a person’s response and the sample mean, accounting for
correlations between responses. In the case of an MFC questionnaire, the vector 𝐷 with an
entry for each participant is calculated using the equation:
2 −1 𝑇
𝐷 = (𝑌 − 𝛾) ⋅ 𝐶𝑂𝑉 ⋅ (𝑌 − 𝛾) . (4)
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 12
𝑌 is a matrix with the binary-coded outcomes for all participants and all pairwise
comparisons in the questionnaire. γ is a vector of thresholds of the binary outcomes and
−1
𝐶𝑂𝑉 the inverse of the covariance matrix of the binary outcome variables. As the
computation of 𝐷 requires complete data (i.e., no missing values), we used multiple
imputation on the binary outcome variables before calculation to avoid too many missing
values in the results (for details on the computation, we refer the reader to the R-script
Rank Order2 Indices
In the rating scale format, LongString indices are used to identify respondents who
repeatedly choose the same response category (Johnson, 2005; Meade & Craig, 2012). We
adapted the logic of LongString indices to the MFC format to generate longOrder indices. In
an item block of size 𝐾 in the MFC format, there are 𝐾! possible rank orders. In the case of
triplets (K = 3), there are six possible rank orders: 1–2–3, 1–3–2, 2–1–3, 2–3–1, 3–1–2 or 3–
2–1. For each participant, it is counted how often in a row the same rank order is chosen
(longOrder). Based on this, we calculated two indices: the maximum of the six longOrder
values (longOrderMax) and the average of all six longOrder values (longOrderAvg). In
addition, the proportion of triplets for which a person simply copied the presented order
(sameOrder) was calculated.
Triplet Variance
This index expresses the variance of a person’s ranking patterns across all triplets in a
questionnaire or the whole survey. The variance is high when participants use all rank orders
equally often and low(er) when some rank orders are preferred over others. For a nominal
variable with K! levels, the dispersion H can be calculated as (Eid et al., 2017, p.133):
group of indices that focus on the rank order. We decided to rename these indices order (i.e., rank order)
because this denomination is more concise.

𝐾!
𝐻 = ⋅ ∑ ℎ ⋅ 𝑙𝑛(ℎ ). (5)
𝑗=1 𝑗 𝑗
𝑙𝑛(𝐾!)
In the MFC format, K! equals the number of possible rank orders and ℎ is the proportion of
rank order k.
Missing Values Index*
This index expresses the ratio of missing values (NA) on item ranks to the total
number of item ranks in the questionnaire or survey. This index was not part of the
preregistration and therefore the analyses regarding this index are exploratory.
The Present Study
Our aim was to examine the performance of and correlations among the indices we
developed to detect careless responding in the MFC format. Furthermore, we were interested
in the types of careless respondents in MFC questionnaires as well as in the proportion of the
sample that responded carelessly. We preregistered four exploratory research questions and
conducted a simulation study in which we modeled careless responding in MFC
questionnaires to provide a conceptional proof of the developed indices for detecting careless
responding in MFC questionnaires. The simulation study was suggested by reviewers and
was therefore not included in the preregistration. The design and rationale of the simulation
are described in the Method section.
Research Questions and Hypotheses
For rating scales, Meade and Craig (2012) found that three factors underly the indices:
consistency, self-report, and LongString. As the nature of MFC data differs substantially
from rating scale data, we sought to investigate how the indices to detect careless responding
in the MFC format relate to each other. Thus, our first research question was:
RQ1: How do the indices to detect careless responding in MFC questionnaires
correlate with each other and what is their factor structure?
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 14
Some of the indices including the self-report items and the consistency or rank order
indices have also been used to detect careless responding in rating scale data (e.g., Meade &
Craig, 2012). For these indices, based on Meade and Craig’s findings, we posited the
following three hypotheses:
H1: The correlations of the self-report items (attention, effort, and use me) with the other
indices will be positive and of small to moderate size.
H2: The self-report items will show moderate positive correlations among each other.
H3: The correlations between the consistency score and the indices longOrderAvg and
longOrderMax will be positive but small.
Beside investigating the intercorrelations among the indices to detect careless
responding, we were also interested in whether different subgroups of respondents exist.
Studies on detecting careless responding in rating scale data have often found three
subgroups/classes of respondents (e.g., Kam & Meyer, 2015; Maniaci & Rogge, 2014; Meade
& Craig, 2012). One class containing the thoughtful participants, a careless class containing
participants who choose one response option repeatedly in a row, and another careless class
containing participants with inconsistent response patterns. The sizes of the different classes
varied in these studies. To extend this knowledge with regard to MFC data, we asked:
RQ2: Do different subgroups of careless respondents exist?
As described above, the proportion of the sample that responds carelessly in studies
based on rating scales varies across studies, indices, and cutoff values. Identifying careless
respondents by performing latent class or latent profile analysis is only one approach
commonly used in the literature. A more widely used approach is the multiple hurdle
approach (e.g., Goldammer et al., 2020). In this index-based approach, a set of careless
responding indices is computed and cutoffs (hurdles) are applied to each of them to identify
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 15
careless respondents. To investigate what proportion of the sample responds carelessly
according to the different indices in the MFC format with different cutoff values, we asked:
RQ3: What proportion of the sample responds carelessly?
Some researchers (e.g., Bowling et al., 2020; Clark et al., 2003; Galesic & Bosnjak, 2009)
expect careless responding to occur more frequently near the end of a questionnaire due to
tiredness or listlessness among participants. For example, Galesic and Bosnjak (2009) found
that participants responded faster at the end of the study and that the variance in the responses
decreased. Therefore, in our study, we compared the proportion of careless respondents
identified by the six indices in the first and last questionnaires of the online survey, and thus
asked:
RQ4: Does careless responding appear more frequently in questionnaires which are
placed near the end of the study (compared to questionnaires at the beginning)?
Exploratory Analyses on the Criterion Validity and Reliability Estimates
Besides these research questions and hypotheses, we also preregistered exploratory
analyses to investigate the impact of removing careless respondents from the sample in the
MFC format. As described above, for rating scales, various studies have investigated how
different proportions of careless respondents can impact the size and direction of observed
correlations (see, for example, Credé, 2010). To examine the criterion validity in our sample,
we computed several correlations with and without the respondents identified as careless in
our analyses and compared these results with correlations reported in the literature. We
focused on the relationships between the Big Five personality traits and narcissism with age
and gender. Our tentative expectation was that the correlations without careless respondents
would be more in line with those reported in the literature and stronger than those with
careless respondents. A second exploratory analysis concerned the reliability of trait
estimates on the scales, as some researchers (e.g., DeSimone et al., 2018) argued that careless
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 16
responding leads to decreased reliability estimates. Hence, we compared the empirical
reliability of trait estimates on the scales based on the whole sample to that in the sample
without the careless respondents.
Method
In the following, we report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions,
and all measures in the study. In addition, we report which software we used for the analyses
and a detailed analysis plan that we also preregistered. Moreover, we describe the design of
the simulation study that we conducted to gain first insights into the kind of careless
responding patterns that are detected by different kinds of indices.
Sample
September 21, 2017 and October 5, 2017. Participants signed up for the study, gave informed
consent, and filled out the questionnaire online on Soscisurvey. On September 21, 2017,
participants were remunerated with 1.75 British pounds, though participants who took longer
than 20 minutes to complete the questionnaire received bonus payments of between 0.40 and
2 British pounds depending on their response time in order to comply with the payment
principles of Prolific Academic with respect to minimum wage. These participants did not
know beforehand that they would receive bonus payments if they took longer. On October 5,
2017, all participants were remunerated with 2.35 British pounds.
The computation of some of the careless responding indices is based on parameters
from the Thurstonian item response theory model. Therefore, the sample size was determined
based on simulation studies regarding the recovery of the model parameters (e.g., Maydeu-
Olivares & Brown, 2011). We planned conservatively (N > 1,000) because only one of the
six questionnaires was originally an MFC instrument. This sample size was also sufficiently
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 17
large for the planned statistical analyses (e.g., correlations, latent profile analysis, and
McNemar’s 𝜒 tests).
After the removal of cases without a valid Prolific Academic ID (who were therefore
not remunerated for their participation), cases who began the questionnaire multiple times,
and cases who sent strange emails to the study organizer, the sample consisted of N = 1,169
persons. This sample size deviates from the preregistered size of N = 1,211 because the
preregistered sample included some participants who were not remunerated for their
participation. The mean age of the final sample was 36.27 years (SD = 11.27) and 64% were
female. The participants originated from six different English-speaking countries (68% from
the United Kingdom and 28% from the United States).
Measures
We administered six questionnaires in English. We used an MFC format with items
presented in triplets and a full ranking instruction. The participants were instructed to rank
the items as follows: “On each page you will be presented with a block of three statements.
Rank these statements according to how well they describe you in your usual behavior. Place
the statement that describes you best at the top, the statement that describes you neither best
nor least in the middle, and the statement that describes you least at the bottom.”
We included questionnaires measuring personality traits (HEXACO, Big Five, Dark
Triad), vocational interests, and other scales related to personality. The six questionnaires in
instrument. For the HEXACO-60, we used the MFC version from Wetzel and Frick (2020).
For the other instruments, we constructed an MFC version with triplets. The number in the
questionnaires (SD3 and IPIP), an instructed response triplet appeared at a random position.
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 18
The order in which the triplets were presented was randomized within the six questionnaires,
Following the questionnaires, participants were asked to evaluate the quality of their
data. Three self-report items were used to assess the effort they put into the study, the
attention they paid to the study, and whether their data should be used in the analyses (for
more details on the item wording see Section Indices for Detecting Careless Responding in
MFC Questionnaires). On the last survey page, the participants were asked for demographic
information (age, gender, and nationality).
Analytic Strategy
The analyses were conducted using Mplus Version 8.9 (Muthen & Muthen, 2012–
2022) and R Version 4.1.0 (R Core Team, 2021) with the packages psych (Revelle, 2021),

preregistration.
Pre-Analysis
Sometimes longer response times per page occur due to pausing the study, distraction,
or spending more time than usual on thinking before answering. This can bias the average
response time over all triplets. Therefore, we calculated the average response time per triplet
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 19
avoid extreme response time values from skewing the overall measure, we replaced values
that were at least twice as high as the 75th percentile of the sample’s average response time
per triplet (green dashed line in bottom boxplot) with random values between the 25th and
the 75th percentile. In total, 5,766 (4%) values were replaced. We replaced these values
rather than treating them as missing, because missing response times already occur when
participants drop out.
Research Question 1
To answer the first research question regarding the correlations among the indices and
their factor structure, we first computed the correlations among the indices. For testing
Hypotheses 1 to 3, we defined a low correlation as . 10 ≤ |𝑟| < .30 and a moderate
correlation as . 30 ≤ |𝑟| < .50, as suggested by Cohen (1988). We tested several correlations
in our hypotheses and decided that the hypotheses would be considered fulfilled if two-thirds
of the correlations met the criteria described above. We checked the prerequisites for
calculating an exploratory factor analysis using two criteria: a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
coefficient above .80 (Kaiser & Rice, 1974) and a Bartlett-Test (Bartlett, 1950) result that
differs significantly (p < .05) from zero.
Research Question 2
To answer the second research question regarding whether different subgroups of
careless respondents existed, we ran a latent profile analysis with the following indices:
response time, self-reported effort, self-reported attention, consistency score, Mahalanobis
distance, longOrderMax, longOrderAvg, sameOrder, and triplet variance. To determine the
number of latent groups, we used the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC; with smaller
values indicating a better fit) and the model entropy (above .60, with higher values indicating
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 20
a more accurate classification of respondents into latent groups), the interpretability of the
resulting groups, and the parsimony of the solution.
Research Question 3
To answer the third research question regarding the proportion of careless
respondents, we computed the proportion of respondents identified as careless by each index.
Furthermore, we derived the proportion of persons assigned to profiles that indicated careless
responding from the latent profile analysis.
Research Question 4
To answer the fourth research question regarding the occurrence of careless
responding, we compared the proportion of careless respondents measured by our indicators
in the first (BFT) and last (ORVIS) questionnaire of the online study. For both
questionnaires, we computed the proportion of careless respondents identified by the
following indices: consistency score, Mahalanobis distance, longOrderMax, longOrderAvg,
sameOrder, and triplet variance. These proportions were compared using McNemar’s tests
with a Bonferroni-corrected significance level of 𝛼 = .01.
Simulation of Different Careless Responding Patterns and Proportions
The simulation study aimed to conceptually prove the developed indices and
supplements the empirical part by giving first insights into the kind of careless responding
patterns that can be detected by different kinds of careless responding indices. Thus, the
research questions were: 1) How do the developed indices respond to increasing proportions
of careless responding? 2) Which manifestations of careless responding patterns can be
detected by which kind of careless responding index? 3) What is the sensitivity and
specificity of the indices at different cutoff values?
According to the literature on careless responding in rating scale data cited above, the
base rate of careless responding is between 4 and 33%. Therefore, we varied the proportion
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 21
of careless responding in our samples between 2 and 40% (in intervals of 5%). We modeled
the two kinds of careless responding patterns that are discussed in the literature: randomness
and longString (in our case longOrder). We divided the second kind into a moderate and a
strong form of rank order repetition. The first careless responding pattern type is called
random order, as it is manifested in the random selection of the rank orders for all of the
blocks in the questionnaire. The second type strong repetition order, is manifested in the
selection and repetition of one rank order throughout the whole questionnaire. The third type
moderate repetition order, is manifested in the selection and repetition of one rank order for
five consecutive triplets. In all types of careless responding patterns, the rank order ‘1–2–3’
had a higher probability (p = .25) of being selected than the remaining rank orders (p = .15).
We also varied the sample composition. Thus, for each proportion of careless
responding in the sample, we also varied the shares (0, .25, .50, .75, and 1) of random and
one of the repetition order patterns. For example, for an overall percentage of careless
responding in the sample of 2%, we simulated nine different sample compositions (see
order) was modeled. In Condition 9 on the contrary, the subsample of careless respondents
(also 2% in total) consisted of 75% random selection of rank orders and 25% of strong
moderate of rank orders. This results in a total of 72 conditions. Each of the simulation
conditions was modeled with a sample size of N = 1,000 and was replicated 1,000 times.
The simulation was based on the Big Five Triplets questionnaire (for details see
study. We simulated the careful/thoughtful responses based on the Thurstonian IRT model
with intercepts [–1; 1] and loadings [0.65; 0.95] sampled from a uniform distribution. For
model identification we set the trait means to zero. The correlations among the Big Five traits
were set to the correlations obtained in the meta-analysis by Anglim et al. (2020, p. 60).
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 22
In each replication, we computed the mean and standard deviation of the indices
consistency score, Mahalanobis distance, triplet variance, longOrderMax, longOrderAvg, and
sensitivity and specificity at these cutoff values. Specifically, we used the Youden-Index (YI;
Youden, 1950) to determine the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. As an overall
performance measure of the careless responding indices, taking into account the balance
between sensitivity and specificity over a range of cutoff values, we calculated the Area
Under the Receiver-Operating-Characteristic Curve (AUC).
Results
We first calculated all of the indices adapted to and developed for the MFC format. As
the consistency score is based on parameters from Thurstonian item response theory models,
we ran these models for each questionnaire before calculating the indices. Unfortunately, the
model for the Short Dark Triad Scale (Jones & Paulhus, 2014) in the MFC format failed to
converge. Therefore, the consistency score was calculated for each of the remaining five
questionnaires. These scores were then averaged. According to the RMSEA, the model fit of
the remaining models was good (BFT = 0.040, BFI-2 = 0.035, HEXACO = 0.031, IPIP
scales = 0.033, and ORVIS = 0.044). The three rank order indices, the triplet variance, and
the missing values index were calculated for each of the six questionnaires as well as for the
whole survey (including all 121 triplets). The response time and RTI were calculated for the
means, standard deviations, confidence intervals, cutoff values, and percentage of the sample
identified as careless respondents by the indices.
3 The remaining indices were not included because either there was no psychometric model on which to base our
simulation (e.g., response time, response time index, and instructed response triplet) or the indices were not
modified from the original study (e.g., the self-report indices).
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 23
For some of the indices, including the self-report items and the instructed response
triplets, natural cutoff values exist. For example, on the instructed response triplets, a given
participant can be flagged as careless when he/she failed to select the prescribed rank order.
For other indices, cutoff values are needed. As this study is the first to investigate the newly
developed indices in the MFC format, no established cutoff values exist. Hence, we used
visual inspection to determine cutoff values for the indices longOrderMax, longOrderAvg,
sameOrder, and triplet variance and calculated deviations from the sample mean to determine
the cutoff values for the response time, RTI, consistency score, and missing values indices.
The calculation of the indices and the determination of the cutoff values are part of the R-
script “4_calc_indices.R”.
After the cutoff values were applied, a sum score of the 11 preregistered indices was
calculated for each participant (TotalSumScore). The TotalSumScore thus counts the number
of indices on which a participant was flagged as careless and ranges from 0 to 11. Eight
hundred and eighty-four participants (76% of the sample) were not flagged by any of the
indices, 165 participants (14% of the sample) were flagged by one index, and 120 participants
(10% of the sample) were flagged by two or more indices. Two participants scored the
highest TotalSumScore of eight.
RQ1: Correlations Among the Indices
To test Hypotheses 1 to 3, we calculated the correlations among the indices and tested
whether two-thirds of the correlations met the criteria of a small or moderate correlation as
missing values index were not part of the preregistration and therefore not included in the
hypotheses tests, but are reported as exploratory results. Bivariate scatter plots of the indices
correlate with most of the preregistered indices. The self-report item effort had a positive but
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 24
small correlation with the other indices, except for the sameOrder index and Mahalanobis
distance, for which there were no correlations. The self-report item attention had a positive
but small correlation with the instructed response triplet, longOrderMax, and triplet variance
indices. Only 11 (out of 24) correlations were low or moderate. Therefore, Hypothesis 1 was
not confirmed. The correlation between the self-report items attention and effort was
moderate and positive. The correlations of use me with effort and use me with attention were
positive but small. Therefore, Hypothesis 2 was not confirmed. The indices longOrderAvg
and longOrderMax did not correlate with the consistency score. Therefore, Hypothesis 3 was
not confirmed. As preregistered and described in the Method section, we used two criteria to
decide whether applying principal axis factoring is reasonable. The Bartlett test showed that
the correlations among the indices differed significantly from zero (𝜒 (91) =10,635,
p < .001), but the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin coefficient was below .80 (KMO = .60). Therefore, the
exploratory factor analysis was not carried out.
RQ2: Subgroups of Careless Respondents
We conducted a latent profile analysis on the indices response time, self-report effort,
self-report attention, consistency score, Mahalanobis distance, longOrderMax,
longOrderAvg, sameOrder, and triplet variance. As described above, we used the BIC and the
entropy of the models, the interpretability of the resulting groups, and the parsimony of the
solution to determine the number of latent groups. Using these criteria, two models seemed to
model with five classes failed to converge. All latent profile analysis models are displayed in
sample was assigned to Class 1 and 16% to Class 2. A comparison of the predicted class
means of the two classes in this model revealed that participants who were assigned to Class
2 on average responded a bit faster, scored lower on the self-report item attention, had higher
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 25
Mahalanobis distance values, repeated a rank order twice as often in a row on longOrderMax,
and had a lower triplet variance. The response time index, instructed response triplet, missing
values index, and the self-report item use me were not part of the latent profile analysis.
Therefore, for these indices, the class means were calculated post hoc. On average, a
participant who was assigned to Class 2 missed one (out of two) instructed response triplets
and had 18% missing values. Based on the class means, it appears that Class 2 contains
careless participants.
In Model 3, 76% of the participants were assigned to Class 1. The second largest class
(19%; Class 2) was on average three minutes faster than Class 1, scored lower on the self-
report items (especially on attention, similarly to Class 2 in Model 1), had higher
Mahalanobis distance values, and repeated on average one triplet more on longOrderMax.
Respondents who were assigned to Class 3 (comprising 3% of the sample) responded ten
minutes faster on average than Class 1 and skipped on average 69% of the items. Due to this
high rate of missing values, the other indices will not be described for this class. The fourth
class in this model (Class 4; 2%) contained respondents who responded on average almost
five minutes faster than Class 1. Participants in this class had on average high values on the
rank order indices and Mahalanobis distance and low values on triplet variance. Based on the
class means, Model 3 revealed three different classes of careless respondents: one which was
characterized by producing many missing values, another one that repeated one rank order
very often in a row, and one that exhibited less extreme values on the indices but still
deviated from the careful respondents in Class 1.
Graphical and Statistical Model Validation
In order to cross-check the results of Model 3, we conducted additional analyses. For
a graphical model validation, we selected three of the indices used in the latent profile
analysis to gain deeper insights into the behavioral differences between the four classes:
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 26
shows violin plots combined with scatter overlays to compare the density distribution and
dispersion of data points across five (sub)samples: the first column shows data from all
participants and the second through fifth columns show data from Classes 1 to 4. In general,
the distinction between the four classes is most obvious when looking at the differences
between the classes on several indices (not just one).
Triplet Variance. Class 1 contained participants with high values on the triplet
variance. The dispersion in this class was very small compared to Class 2 that also included
participants with comparably high values. The values on triplet variance in Class 3 and Class
4 also had a large dispersion, but the majority of the values were below .70, which is rather
low compared to the total sample.
Response Time. Participants in Class 3 had on average the fastest response times. It
was also evident that Class 2 included participants with faster response times in comparison
to the careful class (1).
LongOrderMax. The lower left plot shows the large dispersion in the total sample
and in Class 4 on the index longOrderMax. Shortening the y-axis (12 values are truncated in
the lower right plot), again Class 1 contained the homogeneous values and Class 2 had a
greater dispersion. Class 3 contained those individuals who had the fewest repetitions on the
index longOrderMax compared to the total sample. As a reminder, a longOrderMax of 0
means that a participant has selected a rank order and on the next page a different rank order,
i.e., individuals in this class on average repeated a rank order less than once. Class 4
contained those participants who repeated a given rank order very often in a row.
Multinominal Logistic Regression Models. In order to evaluate the plausibility of
the four classes resulting from Model 4, we ran two multinominal logistic regressions to
examine the relationship between the indices response time index and instructed response
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 27
triplet and class membership. We chose these indices because they were not used to assign
the participants to the latent classes, and thus can be used to cross-check the model solution.
The dependent variable has four categories (i.e., the classes of Model 4). We chose Class 1 as
the reference category because it is the largest class and expected to include the
careful/thoughtful participants.
Response Time Index. The model fit the data (𝜒 (3) = 132.66, p < .001). The
response time index explained 11% of the variance in class membership according to
Nagelkerke’s Pseudo 𝑅 . The response time index was significant in all of the comparisons.
Participants with higher values on the response time index were 12.68 times more likely to be
2 𝑏
in Class 2 than Class 1 (b = 2.98, Wald 𝜒 (1) = 8.30, p < .001, 𝑒 = 12.68), 19.69 times more
2 𝑏
likely to be in Class 3 than Class 1(b = 2.98, Wald 𝜒 (1) = 6.42, p < .001, 𝑒 = 19.69), and
19.89 times more likely to be in Class 4 than Class 1 (b = 2.99, Wald 𝜒 (1) = 6.17, p < .001,
𝑒 = 19.89).
Instructed Response Triplet. The model fit the data (𝜒 (3) = 414.73, p < .001). The
instructed response triplet explained 36% of the variance in class membership according to
Nagelkerke’s Pseudo 𝑅 . The instructed response triplet was significant in all of the
comparisons. Participants with higher values on the instructed response triplet were 16.11
2 𝑏
times more likely to be in Class 2 than Class 1 (b = 2.78, Wald 𝜒 (1) = 9.45, p < .001, 𝑒 =
16.11), 43.81 times more likely to be in Class 3 than Class 1 (b = 3.78, Wald 𝜒 (1) = 8.22, p
< .001, 𝑒 = 43.81), and 58.56 times more likely to be in Class 4 than Class 1 (b = 4.07, Wald
2 𝑏
𝜒 (1) = 10.37, p < .001, 𝑒 = 58.56).
In summary, the model validation of the latent profile analysis was accomplished in
two ways: 1) graphically by going deeper into indices that were part of the analysis and 2)
statistically by multinominal logistic regression models in which class membership was
predicted by indices that were not included in the latent profile analysis. Both kinds of
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 28
analyses revealed that respondents in the four classes differ on a behavioral level that is
captured by the careless responding indices.
RQ3: Proportion of Careless Responding
According to the results of the latent profile analysis, 16 to 24% of the sample were
assigned to classes which showed careless responding behaviors. Another approach to group
proportion of the sample identified as careless by each of the indices. The proportion of
participants flagged by the indices varied between 1% for the self-report item use me and
10% for the instructed response triplets.
RQ4: Comparison of Careless Responding Between First and Last Questionnaire
In this part of the analyses, we compared the proportion of careless respondents
identified by our indices in the first (BFT) versus the last (ORVIS) questionnaire in the online
longOrderAvg, sameOrder, and triplet variance), the proportion of careless respondents
differed significantly between the two questionnaires. For three of these, the proportion of
careless respondents was larger in the last compared to the first questionnaire, whereas for
sameOrder, the effect went in the opposite direction. We additionally compared the
proportion of careless respondents identified by the response time index and missing values
index in an exploratory analysis, as these indices were not preregistered. For both indices, the
proportion in the last questionnaire was higher than in the first.
Exploratory Analyses: Impact of Removing Careless Respondents From the Sample
In order to investigate the impact of removing the participants who were flagged as
careless by our indices from the sample, we computed several correlations with and without
these respondents and compared the results with correlations reported in the literature (see
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 29
A) the results of the latent profile analysis (Class 2 to 4 in Model 3) and B) the combination
of four of our indices (RTI, triplet variance, instructed response triplet, and longOrderMax).
Criterion A flagged 24% of the sample and Criterion B 16%. Seventy-four percent of the
sample was identified as careful by both criteria and 14% as careless by both criteria. For
12% of the sample, the two criteria did not overlap. The results of these two approaches did
not differ much. Due to estimation problems with the Thurstonian item response theory
model for the Short Dark Triad Scale, we cannot compare the correlations of narcissism with
age and gender as we planned in our preregistration.
The correlations of the Big Five personality traits with age and gender reported in the
general, most of the correlations did not differ meaningfully after removing the careless
participants from the sample. A second exploratory analysis addressed the reliability of trait
estimates on the scales. We compared the empirical reliability of the trait estimates on the
scales based on the whole sample with the one without the careless respondents. In order to
compare the reliability estimates, we transformed them using Fisher´s Z transformation.
Removing the careless participants slightly improved the reliability estimates of all Big Five
Simulation Study
In 22,831 of the 72,000 replications (32%), factor scores could not be computed due
to convergence problems of the Thurstonian item response theory model. These convergence
problems occurred mainly in conditions where the proportion of careless responding
exceeded 22% of the sample and strong repetition of rank orders was modeled. Thus, a first
finding of the simulation study is that high proportions of careless responding can lead to
model convergence problems. In these cases, the consistency score index could not be
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 30
computed. Details on the simulation study can be found in the GitHub repository in the
subfolder ‘7_simulation_study’.
Type of Careless Responding
shows the trend for each index as the number of careless respondents increases. For each
index, the values are also broken down by modeled type of careless responding. Thus, the
purple line of strong repetition order consists only of values from conditions where 100%
strong repetition of rank orders was modeled. The red line represents the average across all
conditions for the given proportion of careless responding in the sample. As expected, the
indices do capture different manifestations of careless responding, which will be now
addressed in detail.
Consistency Score. With increasing proportions of careless responding in the sample,
the trend for all modeled types of careless responding is negative for the consistency score
and thus less careless responding. Therefore, the results are in line with the conceptual idea of
this index. Due to the above-mentioned convergence problems with the Thurstonian item
response model, some data points are missing for strong repetition of rank orders.
Triplet Variance. With increasing proportions of careless responding, the trend for
moderate and strong repetition of rank orders is negative while random selection of rank
orders remains stable. Higher values refer to more variance in the response pattern (i.e.,
variation of the different ranking options). Therefore, the results are in line with the
conceptual idea of this index.
LongOrderMax and LongOrderAvg. With increasing proportions of careless
responding, the trend for moderate and strong repetition of rank orders is positive while
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 31
indicate a longer sequence of repeated rank orders. Therefore, the results are in line with the
conceptual idea of the two indices.
SameOrder. The third rank order index expresses the proportion of triplets for which
the presented rank order was copied. With increasing proportions of careless responding the
trend for all types of careless responding is slightly positive. The results are in line with the
conceptual idea of the index.
Mahalanobis Distance. This index expresses the distance between a person’s
response and the sample mean, accounting for correlations between responses. With
increasing proportions of careless responding the trend for all types of careless responding is
stable (despite the outlier). Therefore, the results are not in line with the conceptual idea (i.e.,
more carelessness, more deviation from the sample mean) of this index.
Sensitivity, Youden-Index, and AUC for a set of Cutoff Values
found in the supplemental materials. For all analyzed indices except for the Mahalanobis
Index yields best results for the following cutoff values: consistency score of .70 or .75,
triplet variance of .80, LongOrderMax of 3 or 3.5, LongOrderAvg of 1.25 (but comparable to
the other values), and sameOrder between .20 and .24. The Youden-Index for the cutoff value
The results of the simulation study can be summarized as follows: 1) With the
exception of Mahalanobis distance, the results are consistent with the conceptual idea of the
indices, resulting in trends in the expected direction with increasing proportions of careless
responding in the sample. 2) The indices capture different kinds of careless responding: the
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 32
consistency score captured moderate and random responding best, the triplet variance
captured strong and random responding best, the longOrderMax and -Avg captured strong
and moderate responding best, and the sameOrder captured all forms of careless responding.
3) The balance between sensitivity and specificity of the indices over a range of cutoff values
(i.e., AUC) were in an acceptable to excellent range.
Discussion
The development of models that allow deriving normative trait estimates boosted the
use of the MFC format in research and practice. Several MFC questionnaires especially for
the assessment of personality traits have been developed including occupational personality
inventories (e.g., Watrin et al., 2019), and scales assessing maladaptive personality traits
(e.g., Guenole et al., 2016). In addition, research has, for example, investigated the validity of
existing instruments (e.g., Walton et al., 2020; Watrin et al., 2019; Wetzel & Frick, 2020,
Zhang et al., 2020) and developed methods that can be used for constructing new instruments
(e.g., Frick, 2021; Pavlov et al., 2021) and for detecting differential item functioning (e.g.,
Lee et al., 2021). However, it was so far unclear how to detect careless responding in MFC
data. Therefore, in this study, we developed a number of indices to detect careless responding
in MFC questionnaires. These indices can easily be computed using the functions we
provide a first examination of the indices’ performance and the extent of careless responding
in MFC data based on a large online sample. In general, it seems that careless responding is
an important issue that should be addressed not only in rating scale data but also in the MFC
format. However, adapting careless responding indices from the rating scale to the MFC
format is not straightforward and will not necessarily lead to the same behavior and
performance. Our hypotheses on the indices’ relations, which were based on prior research
with similar indices in the rating scale format, all had to be rejected. According to the results
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 33
of the latent profile analysis, between 16 and 24 percent of the sample responded carelessly.
The examined indices differed in their performance with the triplet variance, longOrderMax,
instructed response triplets, and response time index performing best overall. There was
twofold evidence for this in the data: 1) the correlations of these indices with the other indices
were comparatively high, and 2) the average class means in the latent profile analysis differed
on these indices. Removing participants who were flagged by these four indices slightly
improved reliability estimates for most of the scales. The results of the simulation study
confirmed that, with the exception of the Mahalanobis distance, the examined indices work as
intended conceptually.
Is Careless Responding the Same in Rating Scales and MFC Questionnaires?
Various results from this study can be compared to the results of studies investigating
careless responding in rating scale questionnaires. Although the correlations among the
indices for the MFC format were smaller than expected, the results regarding latent classes of
careless respondents and the increase in careless responding over the course of the online
survey were in line with studies using questionnaires in the rating scale format. These
similarities and differences will be discussed in the following paragraphs.
Correlations Among the Careless Responding Indices
Our results showed some differences to findings from rating scales regarding the
nature of careless responding and the performance of the indices. One of the most evident
differences was the correlational structure among the indices. Some of the indices that
worked well in the rating scale format, including Mahalanobis distance, did not correlate with
most of the other indices in the MFC format. Moreover, the indices did not share a substantial
amount of variance, as indicated by a low KMO value.
We posed our hypotheses regarding the correlations among the indices based on
results obtained with rating scale data by Meade and Craig (2012) and implemented the same
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 34
self-report items in our online survey as they did. Two of the three hypotheses concerned the
correlations with and among the three self-report items effort, attention and use me. The two
response formats differ from each other; therefore, it is not surprising that the correlations of
our MFC indices with the self-report items differed from the ones reported by Meade and
Craig for the rating scale indices. However, the correlations among the self-report items also
differed between studies, despite the fact that these items were identical in both studies. The
most striking differences were found for use me, for which we found no relationships with
most of the other indices. It is possible that this result is related to our data collection using
Prolific Academic. On this platform, every user has a unique ID that can be linked across
several studies. Researchers who detect low-quality or suspicious data can report these IDs to
Prolific (e.g., Lumsden, 2018). Participants might have feared being rejected from future
studies if they stated that their data should not be used for analysis.
Types of Indices and Groups of Respondents
Other studies using the rating scale format tended to report small relationships among
the careless responding indices and argued that this small overlap underscores the need to use
different types of indices (e.g., DeSimone & Harms, 2018). With the term types of indices,
we refer to groups of indices that capture similar response behavior: For instance, the rank
order indices are of the same type, while the self-report items are of another type. Another
result of our study which might support the recommendation to use different types of indices
for data cleaning are the different latent classes. In latent class or profile analysis, multiple
indicators are used to assign participants to classes. The results of the latent profile analysis in
this study suggest that our sample consisted of four classes: a large careful class containing
the majority of participants, and three smaller careless classes. The three careless classes
differed with regard to the extent and manifestation of careless responding measured by our
indicators. Studies conducting latent profile analysis in order to investigate careless
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 35
responding in the rating scale format have often found three classes of respondents (e.g., Kam
& Meyer, 2015; Maniaci & Rogge, 2014; Meade & Craig, 2012). The additional class we
found is more likely to be attributed to differences in the handling of missing values (i.e., we
did not exclude participants with missing values from the analysis) than to the difference in
response format. The remaining three classes converge with those found for rating scales. In
line with results by Kam and Meyer (2015), Maniaci and Rogge (2014), and Meade and
Craig (2012), we found a small class containing participants who chose one response option
(scale point or rank order) repeatedly in a row and another (somewhat larger) careless class
with participants responding inconsistently. In the previous studies, the latter class was also
distinguishable from the other classes by high values on Mahalanobis distance, which was not
evident in our data. The proportion of the sample assigned to the different classes varied in
previous research. In Kam and Meyer (2015), the class of careless respondents with high
values on LongString comprised 14% of the sample. In our sample as well as in the other two
rating scale studies (Maniaci & Rogge, 2014; Meade & Craig, 2012), this class was notably
smaller (i.e., 1–2%). Thus, although the rating scale and MFC format differ substantially
from each other, our results suggest some similarities in the nature of careless responding
across the two formats.
Careless Responding Over the Course of the Study
For the rating scale format, increases in the occurrence of careless responding over the
course of the study have been found (e.g., Bowling et al., 2020; Clark et al., 2003; Galesic &
Bosnjak, 2009). Hence, we compared the percentage of respondents identified as careless in
the first and last questionnaires of the online survey. Interestingly, the sameOrder index
yielded a larger proportion of careless respondents in the first questionnaire. This might be
related to the fact that people who are not yet familiar with the forced-choice format choose
the presented rank order more often when they are unsure about how to rank the items. Later
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 36
in the questionnaire, as they gain more experience, they may choose different rank orders in
this case.
The proportion of participants flagged as careless by the other two rank order indices,
longOrderMax and longOrderAvg, and by the triplet variance was significantly higher in the
last questionnaire. This increase in careless responding over the course of the study is in line
with findings for the rating scale format regarding the LongString index (Bowling et al.,
2020) and the variability of the response pattern (Galesic & Bosnjak, 2009). In an exploratory
analysis, we found that the proportion of participants identified as careless by the response
time index and missing values index was higher in the last questionnaire. The result for the
response time index is in line with previous research (e.g., Bowling et al., 2020; Galesic &
Bosnjak, 2009), but the result for missing values contrasts with the results by Galesic and
Bosnjak (2009), who reported no increase in missing values.
These results suggest that at least some participants who were flagged as careless
respondents by the indices did not respond carelessly to all questionnaires in the online study.
Therefore, it might be beneficial to exclude careless respondents using model-based
approaches, perhaps based on response times (e.g., Ulitzsch et al., 2021), or on the
questionnaire level rather than cutoff values based on the whole survey.
Recommendations for Detecting Careless Responding in the MFC Format
The results of our study have several implications for practitioners using
questionnaires in the MFC format. First, we recommend including instructed response triplets
together with the questionnaire of interest. The efficacy of the instructed response triplets was
highlighted by the results of the latent profile analysis: The instructed response triplet index
was not used as a variable to assign the participants to different classes, but the post-hoc
calculation of the average class mean on this index showed that the careful classes missed
practically none of the instructed response triplets. When including this kind of question in a
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 37
survey, researchers must bear in mind that it may unsettle or confuse participants who are
conscientiously filling out the questionnaire. Therefore, it is recommended to keep the
number of instructed response items in balance with the total number of survey items (e.g.,
one instructed response item per 50–100 questionnaire items; Meade & Craig, 2012).
Second, throughout both parts of our study the Mahalanobis distance did not provide
promising results. Specifically, there was no substantial overlap with the other indices.
Moreover, with increasing proportions of careless responding in the sample, there was no
obvious effect on the Mahalanobis distance visible. Therefore, we recommend calculating the
index only as an additional measure, if at all.
Third, as our indices varied in their sensitivity to different manifestations and degrees
of careless responding, we recommend using different kinds of indicators to identify distinct
careless responding groups. Therefore, after data collection is completed, we recommend
using at least the indices triplet variance, longOrderMax, and response time index to screen
for careless respondents. These three indices capture different kinds of careless responding
behaviors. To calculate the response time index, the response time per page is needed.
Therefore, when implementing an online survey, it is advisable to check beforehand how the
response time is measured.
Limitations and Future Directions
As this study is the first to investigate detection methods for careless responding in
the MFC format, the results need to be validated in further studies using different data sets.
For practitioners, the careless responding indices can be a valuable tool. However, we must
acknowledge their limitations (e.g., flagging false positives). As our understanding of the
manifestation of careless responding in MFC questionnaires deepens, future research should
focus on the development of model-based detection methods. A general limitation of some
indices, including Mahalanobis distance or the response time, is that their cutoff values are
CARELESS RESPONDING IN MFC QUESTIONNAIRES 38
sample-dependent and cannot easily be generalized across studies. The simulation study was
useful for a conceptual proof of the indices and we identified cutoff values for some indices.
These results are subject to validation in further analysis, as we made strong assumptions in
our simulation (e.g., only interindividual variation of careless responding). Furthermore, the
performance of the consistency score might depend on how well the model fits the data.
Another limitation of the present study is that all questionnaires were forced-choice
questionnaires with three items per block and a full ranking instruction. For other variants of
the MFC format, the careless responding indices may have to be slightly modified. To what
extent our results are applicable to other variants of the MFC format needs to be investigated
in further studies.
Conclusion
This study serves as a starting point for investigating careless responding in MFC
questionnaires. The adapted and newly developed indices to detect careless responding in the
MFC format differed in how well they worked. Some practical recommendations include
using an instructed response triplet and calculating several indices post-hoc that capture
different manifestations of careless responding behavior. Future studies should validate the
results and work to establish appropriate cutoff values.
