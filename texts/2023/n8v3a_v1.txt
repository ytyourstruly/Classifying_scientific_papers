1 Optimizing the input for learning of L2-specific constructions: The roles of Zipfian and
2 balanced input, explicit rules and working memory
4 Abstract
5 Usage-based theory has proposed that learning of linguistic constructions is facilitated by
6 input that contains few high-frequency exemplars, in what is known as a skewed (or Zipfian)
7 input distribution. Early empirical work provided support to this idea, but subsequent L2
8 research has provided mixed findings. However, previous approaches have not explored the
9 impact that cognitive traits (e.g., working memory) have on the effectiveness of skewed or
10 balanced input. The experiment reported here tested learners’ ability to develop new L2
11 categories of adjectives that guide lexical selection in Spanish verbs of “becoming”. The results
12 showed that, when explicit rules are provided, low-working memory learners benefitted from
13 reduced variability in skewed input, while high-working memory individuals benefitted from
14 balanced input, which better allows for rule-based hypothesis testing. The findings help clarify
15 the mixed findings in previous studies, and suggest a way forward for optimizing the L2 input
16 based on individual traits.
1 Optimizing the input for learning of L2-specific constructions: The roles of Zipfian and balanced
2 input, explicit rules and working memory
4 1. Introduction
6 Usage-based approaches propose that, to learn a language, speakers must accumulate
7 experience of regular linguistic patterns through exposure to the input (Bybee, 2008; Ellis &
8 Wulff, 2014; Ellis et al., 2013; Tomasello, 2005). But what work in recent years has highlighted
9 is that exposure to just any form of input may not be sufficient for successful language learning.
10 Importantly, previous research has reported that the ability to learn new constructions from the
11 input may be facilitated by specific frequency distributions, such as low variability input
12 distributions which present a few prototypical lexical exemplars with very high frequency. In
13 fact, such low variability (or “skewed”) input distributions are pervasive in natural language
14 (Zipf’s law; e.g., Lavi-Rotbain & Arnon, 2023) and are believed to facilitate novel pattern
15 detection during language acquisition (Goldberg, Casenhiser & Sethuraman, 2004). It has been
16 proposed that constructions are learnable in part thanks to the presence of highly prototypical
17 exemplars, which facilitate the formation of new categories and the integration of less frequent
18 non-prototypical exemplars (e.g., Abbot-Smith & Tomasello, 2006; Bybee & Eddington, 2006;
19 Ibbotson et al., 2012; Goldberg, 2013). In contrast, highly variable (or “balanced”) input, in
20 which multiple lexical items are equally frequent, is believed to make pattern detection more
21 difficult.
22 Support for the superiority of skewed input comes from early work with children and
23 adults by Goldberg and colleagues. In a series of experiments that investigated the learning of a
1 novel construction1, learning was found to be significantly improved when linguistic input
2 presented a skewed distribution (Goldberg et al., 2004; 2007; Casenhiser & Goldberg, 2005).
3 More specifically, in a study with adult native English speakers –which extended previous work
4 with children (Casenhiser & Goldberg, 2005)— Goldberg and colleagues (2007) found that
5 skewed input significantly improved learning when the same exemplars were presented
6 repeatedly at the beginning of exposure (this was called “skewed first” input), relative to input in
7 which frequencies were randomly skewed or balanced across lexical items. Therefore, later
8 studies that have investigated skewed input have typically employed “skewed first” –rather than
9 “skewed random”— input.2
10 However, subsequent L2 research on the effectiveness of skewed input has produced
11 mixed results. Several subsequent experiments with L2 learners reported either no differences
12 between skewed and balanced input or even an advantage for balanced input (Nakamura, 2012;
13 McDonough & Nekrasova-Becker, 2011; McDonough & Trofimovich, 2013; Year & Gordon,
14 2009). In an experiment that investigated Thai speakers’ acquisition of the English double-object
15 construction, McDonough and Nekrasova-Becker (2014) found a significant advantage for
16 learners exposed to balanced, rather than skewed input. The authors proposed that the failure to
17 find an advantage for skewed input in L2 learners might be due to differences in the mechanisms
18 engaged by adults during categorization, and particularly their tendency for explicit learning
19 strategies and rule searching.
1 These studies used a novel “appearance” construction, in which a first noun phrase expresses the grammatical
subject and a second noun phrase expresses the location. For example, the sentence “the rabbit the hat mooped”
describes a rabbit appearing on a hat. Input distributions were manipulated based on the variability of the nonce-
verbs used (e.g., “mooped”).
2 Unless otherwise specified, in the rest of the text the bare term “skewed” is used to refer to “skewed first” input.
1 Specifically, rule-based learning allows individuals to engage in hypothesis testing upon
2 each encounter with new stimuli – a strategy that may be most productive when input is more
3 variable, as is the case with balanced, rather than skewed, input. This idea was supported by
4 McDonough and Trofimovich (2013), who found that when explicit rules were provided (i.e.,
5 “deductive” exposure), only balanced input led to significant learning; in contrast, in the absence
6 of rules (“inductive” exposure), balanced input led to below-chance accuracy and was inferior to
7 skewed input. Therefore, some previous results suggest that learners’ ability to engage in
8 hypothesis testing deeply influences the effectiveness of skewed or balanced input.
9 This idea is relatable to work that has found an important effect of individual learner
10 cognitive resources under explicit, but not implicit, learning conditions. Previous data has shown
11 that even when different learners are exposed to the same input, individual differences in
12 working memory (WM) are associated with variability in how exemplars become categorized
13 (DeCaro, Thomas & Beilock, 2008), as well as variability in linguistic performance (Navarro,
14 Dussias & Kroll, 2022). More specifically, within the literature on L2 acquisition, a considerable
15 body of evidence has found that individual WM capacity is a significant predictor of learning in
16 explicit conditions (Reber, Walkenfeld & Hernstadt, 1991; Robinson, 2005; Tagarelli, Borges-
17 Mota & Rebuschat, 2011, 2015). Given this, exploring the contribution of individual differences
18 provides a promising avenue to clarify the mixed findings regarding the effect of exposure to
19 input that is skewed or balanced.
20 The notion that specific input conditions may unequally benefit different learners, based
21 on individual aptitude-based differences such as WM, is in line with research on so-called
22 aptitude-by-treatment interactions (ATI) within second language acquisition (DeKeyser, 2019;
23 Robinson, 2001). The ATI approach is based on the idea that the effectiveness of language
1 learning depends on the interaction between an individual's skill and the type of treatment they
2 receive (DeKeyser, 2021; Skehan, 1989; Vatz et al., 2013).3 Therefore, a primary goal focuses on
3 identifying and matching individual learners' aptitudes with learning conditions that may
4 enhance language learning outcomes. In this logic, it is conceivable --or, even, expected-- that
5 the effectiveness of a particular type of treatment (skewed or balanced input) may be modulated
6 by individual learner traits.
7 Very limited previous work within the ATI framework has considered how individual
8 differences might modulate the effect of skewed or balanced input, and none have --to the best of
9 the author's knowledge-- considered the role of individual WM. In a study that considered the
10 role of individual learner traits during exposure to skewed and balanced input, Brooks and
11 colleagues (2017) examined the potential effect of nonverbal intelligence on the acquisition of
12 Russian morphology. Based on previous work in which the authors examined the effect of input
13 variability (by manipulating the number of new vocabulary items presented, rather than input
14 skewness; Brooks & Kempe, 2013), they predicted learners would benefit from balanced input
15 only if they had higher nonverbal intelligence (as measured by section of the Culture Fair
16 Intelligence Test). Contrary to their predictions, no significant interactions were found between
17 skewed/balanced input and their measure of nonverbal intelligence on the acquisition of
18 morphology.
19 So far, Brooks and colleagues' study appears to be the only previous work that explicitly
20 examined the role of individual differences during exposure to skewed or balanced input, with no
21 previous studies having considered the role of WM in this regard. That is, despite that fact that
3 In a different, but somewhat related vein, the "desirable difficulties" approach also considers how learning gains
may be impacted by interactions between individual learner traits and training difficulty; see, e.g., Bjork & Kroll
(2015), Suzuki et al. (2019), Pulido & Dussias (2020).
1 well-documented variability in learning outcomes has been associated with differences in WM
2 capacity, the contribution of individual differences to learning from input that is skewed or
3 balanced has not been adequately explored.
4 The limited current understanding of this issue limits L2 research, and risks disfavoring at
5 least a portion of learners for whom specific input properties may not be most adequate. Taking
6 an aptitude-by-treatment interaction approach, the goal of the present study is to investigate how
7 individual differences in cognitive skill –specifically in WM— modulate learners’ ability to form
8 categories from the input. The experiment reported below capitalizes on a well-studied set of
9 verbs in Spanish, termed verbs of “becoming”, to investigate learners’ ability to learn new L2
10 categories under different input conditions. The following section reviews prior evidence on how
11 variability in WM, as a central cognitive resource for processing information, may modulate
12 individuals' ability to learn from different types of input.
14 1.1. Alternative learning pathways: The role of working memory and verbalizable
15 rules in learning
16 The extant neuropsychological theory has underscored that category learning (as other
17 aspects of human cognition) is characterized by the existence of more than one system with the
18 ability to perform a similar function. In particular, previous work has pointed at competition
19 between explicit verbal learning (i.e., when learning is guided by verbalizable rules) and implicit
20 learning systems (Ashby, Alfonso-Reese & Waldron, 1998; Green, Crinion & Price, 2006).
21 There is good evidence that the explicit and implicit learning systems recruit different cognitive
22 resources, and that these systems are in fact neurally dissociable (Chandrasekaran, Yi &
23 Maddox, 2014).
1 Importantly, previous work in cognitive psychology and in L2 learning indicates that
2 differences in cognitive profile (e.g., in WM) may modulate the effectiveness of specific
3 pathways engaged during input processing and category learning. In particular, tasks that can be
4 conducted by relying on explicit information depend on WM resources. WM is believed to play a
5 particularly important role in rule-based (“deductive”) learning: Conditions in which rules are
6 available, and thus encourage explicit hypothesis testing during processing (McDonough &
7 Trofimovich, 2013) have been found to place greater demands on WM resources (Tagarelli et al.,
8 2015, Waldron & Ashby, 2001). In contrast, implicit information-integration learning is thought
9 to rely on the procedural learning system, and functions independently of WM resources (Ashby
10 et al., 1998; Chandrasekaran et al., 2014).4
11 Some valuable insight on the engagement of WM comes from studies in cognitive
12 science that have focused on learning of non-linguistic stimuli, as well as learning of
13 (semi)artificial languages, to examine the role of individual differences under controlled learning
14 conditions. In an influential study on visual category learning, Waldron and Ashby (2001) found
15 that in an explicit learning condition --in which distinctions between stimuli were easy to
16 verbalize via an explicit rule-- learning ability was predicted by individuals' ability to rely on
17 WM; in fact, when WM resources were overtaxed by a secondary task, learning was disrupted.
18 In contrast, in implicit learning conditions --in which stimuli properties were difficult to
19 verbalize via explicit rules-- the level of WM load did not modulate learning ability (for further
20 evidence of a dual-learning system see Chandrasekaran et al., 2013; Maddox et al., 2013;
4 WM span is a relevant measure in that it reflects a higher ability to temporarily store and retrieve information (e.g.,
words), in the face of interference from another task (e.g., considering an explicit rule; or solving arithmetic
operations, as in the Operation-Span task; see section 3.2 for further details).
1 although for potential interactions between explicit and implicit learning see, e.g., Forkstam &
2 Petersson, 2005).
3 Similar evidence on the involvement of WM is found within the realm of language
4 learning. In a study examining the learning of linguistic structure via explicit rules or
5 incidentally, Tagarelli et al. (2011) employed a semi-artificial language consisting of English
6 lexicon and German syntax; using a semi-artificial language allowed the authors to investigate
7 learning of verb order in the absence of lexical learning demands. Tagarelli and colleagues
8 hypothesized that learning performance would be correlated with WM, to the extent that learners
9 relied on a rule to engage in explicit hypothesis testing; however, they also hypothesized that
10 WM should not influence learning in a condition with no explicit rules, which favored implicit
11 information-integration learning. To test this idea, they exposed participants to conditions in
12 which learners could either rely on a verbalizable rule or not, while examining the contribution
13 of WM in each condition. Their results showed that only when a verbal rule was available –
14 enabling hypothesis-testing during input exposure— did individuals with higher WM achieve
15 higher learning rates than those with lower WM.
16 Interestingly, work on category learning has also suggested that individuals with higher
17 WM are not always at a learning advantage when acquiring the defining aspects of a new
18 category. Some insightful evidence comes from the role of WM during learning of non-linguistic
19 categories, under exposure to verbalizable or non-verbalizable patterns (e.g., when visual
20 categories are defined by cues such as shape, color). Indeed, in contexts in which learners cannot
21 rely on verbalizable rules, and therefore require engaging in bottom-up categorization,
22 individuals with lower working memory abilities have been found to outperform higher-WM
23 individuals (DeCaro et al., 2008). More generally, conditions that tax WM have been found to
1 impair rule-based learning, while they tend to leave implicit category learning unaffected (e.g.,
2 Markman et al., 2006; Waldron & Ashby, 2001).
3 The acknowledgement of variability in cognitive pathways engaged during learning
4 across individuals has important theoretical and practical ramifications for research on learning
5 (Green et al., 2006). The studies reviewed above suggest that individual learners might benefit
6 best from exposure to input conditions that encourage the optimal input-processing strategy
7 based on their individual abilities (for a similar approach see, e.g., Perrachione et al., 2011). In
8 particular, these findings indicate that considering WM capacity may allow to identify and match
9 the optimal learning conditions for individuals with different levels of cognitive skill, in line with
10 aptitude-by-treatment interaction (ATI) approaches in L2 acquisition (see also, e.g., Indrarathne
11 and Kormos, 2018; Perrachione et al., 2011, or the studies in DeKeyser, 2021).
12 As noted above, however, almost no previous studies have examined the role of
13 individual differences during exposure to skewed or balanced input (with the exception of
14 Brooks et al., 2006); and no previous work has considered the role of WM on the ability to learn
15 from different input distributions. Given the significant role of WM in previous studies that
16 investigated explicit L2 learning conditions, the experiment reported below seeks to clarify the
17 mixed evidence on the influence of skewed and balanced input, by taking into account diversity
18 in WM capacity among the learner population.
20 2. Present study
22 The goal of the present study is to investigate how individual differences in cognitive
23 resources (specifically in WM span) modulate the effectiveness of skewed and balanced input,
1 by examining learning in deductive (rule-based) and inductive (without explicit rules) learning
2 conditions. This rationale is in line with an aptitude-by-treatment interaction approach (e.g.,
3 DeKeyser, 2012, 2021; Robinson, 2001). That is, given that learners differ in their internal
4 resources available during input processing, it should not be assumed that the same input will
5 engage the same processing strategies across different learners.
6 Taking direction from the evidence reviewed above, firstly, the present study
7 manipulated the type of I D . I hypothesized that, by facilitating the learning of
NPUT ISTRIBUTION
8 high-frequency exemplars, skewed input distributions may alleviate learners’ cognitive burden.
9 In contrast, balanced input --which is, by definition, more highly variable-- would pose a higher
10 burden on WM. As such, balanced input may be beneficial for learners with relatively higher
11 WM resources, while skewed input would be more beneficial for lower-WM learners.
12 Secondly, to create conditions that differed in their level of demand on WM, the present
13 study manipulated the I T . Following McDonough and Trofimovich (2013), the
NSTRUCTION YPE
14 present study employed deductive and inductive learning conditions, which differed on whether
15 learners were provided with an explicit rule that guided their learning prior to being exposed to
16 the input ("deductive" learning) or whether no rule was provided to guide input processing
17 ("inductive learning").5 In deductive learning participants are better able to engage in hypothesis
18 testing, by testing an explicit rule upon each encounter with new stimuli. As reviewed above,
19 previous work has indicated that deductive hypothesis testing places higher demands on WM,
5 The inductive/deductive employed here, modelled after McDonough and colleagues' work, has some differences
and similarities to incidental/intentional, implicit/explicit conditions in other studies. For example, Tagarelli et al.
(2015) employed "incidental and intentional conditions . . . designed to promote the acquisition of implicit and
explicit knowledge, respectively" (227). Their incidental learning condition instructed participants to repeat stimuli,
but did not announce that they would be tested. In contrast, their intentional condition provided no rule, but warned
participants that they would be tested (this would be most comparable to the inductive learning condition employed
here). Rather than taking this approach, the present study capitalized on the inductive/deductive distinction used in
previous studies on skewed input effects, which are more directly relevant to the goals of the study.
1 and leads to learning outcomes that are predicted by individual WM span (DeCaro et al., 2008;
2 Tagarelli et al., 2011).
3 The two variables (I D and I T ) will allow to explore the
NPUT ISTRIBUTION NSTRUCTION YPE
4 conditions that may create enable (or hinder) learning for individuals of different cognitive
5 profiles. (see the detailed hypotheses and predictions described in Section 2.2).
6 To investigate the influence of these variables on learners’ ability to learn new L2
7 categories, the experiment reported below capitalizes on a well-studied set of verbs in Spanish,
8 termed verbs of “becoming”. Spanish verbs of becoming, which comprise a number of quasi-
9 synonymous verbs including ponerse, quedarse or volverse (all functionally equivalent to
10 “become”), are a case in point for categorization that involves L1-L2 incongruent constructions.
11 Because usage of the specialized verbs of becoming relies on knowledge of different semantic
12 categories of adjectives, speakers of languages such as English must develop new categories into
13 which to group known adjectives.
14 Analogical extension has been identified as a reliable rule for successful categorization
15 (Bybee & Eddington, 2006). In other words, a prototypical adjective often becomes the basis for
16 generalization when using a specific [verb + adjective] construction, such as [ponerse +
17 adjective], or [quedarse + adjective]. In a study of L1 speaker corpus and similarity judgements,
18 Bybee and Eddington (2006) showed that adjectives used in discourse with each verb of
19 becoming –e.g., ponerse and volverse— formed well-defined semantic categories around a high-
20 frequency, prototypical adjective. For example, a prototypical verb-adjective combination such
21 as ponerse + nervioso (“nervous”) accounted for verb choices with less frequent and even
22 innovative adjectives. Given a prototypical adjective for a specific verb (ponerse + nervioso),
23 less frequent and even innovative combinations (histérico “hysterical”, agresivo “aggressive” or
1 furioso “furious”) were readily accounted for based on similarity, as confirmed by semantic
2 association networks based on native speaker semantic judgements.
3 Of the verbs of becoming, two verbs –namely, volverse and ponerse—are selected here
4 which form categories that are best defined based on semantic clusters (Bybee & Eddington,
5 2006; Eddington, 1999). Previous work has highlighted the difficulty of formulating rules to
6 guide categorization of Spanish verbs of becoming, and verb selection based on rules that
7 describe e.g., slow/fast change, or passive/active change, is somewhat overlapping and not clear-
8 cut (Bybee & Eddington, 2006; Eddington, 1999; Ibarretxe-Antuñano & Cheikh-Khamis, 2019),
9 making acquisition a notable challenge for L2 speakers. Instead, previous usage-based work that
10 examined actual usage in corpus data (Brown & Cortés-Torres, 2012; Bybee & Eddington, 2006)
11 suggests that a prototype-based rule may be most effective at guiding learners in the formation of
12 semantic adjective clusters. Therefore, learners are expected to successfully categorize exemplars
13 when directed by an explicit rule indicating that categories are built around a prototype (i.e.,
14 “ponerse is used with words related in meaning to the word ‘nervous’, and quedarse with words
15 related to word ‘still’”). Mirroring the frequencies of natural corpus data, the skewed condition
16 employed here presented with higher frequency two adjectives (i.e., nervioso, 'nervous' and
17 quieto 'still') that have been identified as central based on their high frequency of used with each
18 verb in previous work (Bybee & Eddington, 2006). However, in order to develop semantic
19 categories (i.e., groups of semantically related adjectives) structured around a prototypical
20 member (e.g., ponerse nervioso), it is not clear whether, and to what degree, variability is
21 beneficial.
22 Following previous work discussed above (e.g., Goldberg et al., 2007; McDonough &
23 Trofimovich, 2013), the present study employed a paradigm consisting of exposure followed by
1 generalization. That is, to learn the new linguistic categories, participants are first exposed to a
2 small set of items under different experimental learning conditions. Subsequently, they are asked
3 to make generalizations on a new set of untrained items based on the recently learned categories.
4 Thus, to summarize, the present experiment was based on a 2x2 design. Learners were exposed
5 to one of two types of : skewed input, in which a prototypical adjective was
INPUT DISTRIBUTION
6 presented with higher frequency for each verb; or balanced input, in which all adjectives
7 associated with each verb appeared with equal frequency. Additionally, training was manipulated
8 based on : inductive learning, for which no explicit rules were provided; or
INSTRUCTION TYPE
9 deductive learning, for which an explicit verbal rule encouraged hypothesis testing during
10 exposure. Finally, the effect of individual (WM) on learning under each
WORKING MEMORY
11 context was examined.
13 2.1. Research Questions
15 Guided by the findings reviewed above, this study examined the following research
16 questions.
18 RQ 1: How does skewed input, which provides high-frequency exposure to a prototypical
19 adjective, facilitate the learning of the categories of the verbs of “becoming” constructions?
21 RQ 2: How does the deductive instruction type, in which a verbal rule is explicitly provided,
22 modulate the effect of skewed or balanced input?
1 RQ 3: How does individual WM capacity modulate the effects of input distribution and
2 instruction type?
4 2.2. Hypotheses and predictions
6 The experiment reported below will allow to test three different hypotheses grounded in
7 the previous literature, and their associated predictions:
8 Skewed input hypothesis. This hypothesis would predict a main effect of input
9 distribution, such that skewed input facilitates acquisition of constructions by maximizing
10 exposure to a highly frequent “pathbreaker” item.
11 Previous mixed findings suggest that, even within this view, it must be assumed that there
12 is variability in skewed input benefitting some learners, while not having an effect in others. In
13 this scenario, skewed input may still bear an advantage even if only for some learners. For
14 example, at the group level, skewed input may provide stability in the transmission of linguistic
15 structures, by allowing all speakers to acquire regular patterns in the input with no trade-off (e.g.,
16 Goldberg et al., 2007, Lavi-Rotbain & Arnon, 2022); while no advantage for balanced input
17 would be predicted. This hypothesis remains agnostic towards the potential effect of instruction
18 type and WM.
19 Rule-testing hypothesis. This hypothesis would predict that, rather than seeing a benefit
20 of skewed input, balanced input should be beneficial for L2 learners, particularly in deductive
21 learning conditions.
22 Previous L2 studies with adult learners have proposed that balanced input is more
23 beneficial because it provides more variability for hypothesis testing. This view is supported by
1 work that found an advantage of balanced input when combined with an explicitly stated rule
2 (McDonough & Trofimovich, 2013; McDonough & Nekrasova-Becker, 2014). No specific
3 prediction is made for WM on the basis of this hypothesis, although a general benefit of higher
4 WM would be expected.
5 Available cognitive resources hypothesis. This hypothesis attempts to reconcile previous
6 findings, by predicting that WM will modulate the effect of input distributions: Higher-WM
7 learners may benefit from balanced input in deductive conditions (rule-testing hypothesis),
8 whereas lower-WM learners will benefit from skewed input.
9 The view proposed here is that both hypotheses above are true under specific
10 circumstances. Taking direction from evidence in the adult categorization literature and in L2
11 learning (e.g., DeCaro et al., 2008; Tagarelli et al., 2011), it is hypothesized that skewed input
12 may be more beneficial when cognitive resources are burdened or limited. This may be due to
13 learner-internal causes (individual learners inherently have lower cognitive resources available,
14 e.g., lower WM) or due to learner-external causes (cognitive load is high, e.g., during explicit
15 hypothesis testing in deductive learning), In conditions that promote hypothesis testing, balanced
16 input may be beneficial, but only as long as learners’ cognitive resources are on par with task
17 demands. In other words, this view makes the specific prediction that skewed input should be
18 more beneficial than balanced input at baseline (inductive learning); but that in more cognitively
19 demanding learning conditions (deductive learning), skewed input will mainly benefit low-WM
20 learners, while high-WM learners will benefit from balanced input. In concrete terms, an
21 interaction between WM, input distribution and instruction type would be expected.
23 3. Methodology
2 3.1. Participants
3 Monolingual native speakers of English (N=115) were recruited through Prolific
6 reported more than minimal knowledge of Spanish in their responses to a language history
7 questionnaire (i.e., self-ratings greater than the minimum value of 1 in a scale from 1 to 7). Nine
8 additional participants were excluded due to inattentiveness during the training phase (accuracy
9 < 80%) and 17 were excluded because they failed to adequately learn the verb-adjective pairings
10 after training exposure (test accuracy < 70%). The final pool for analysis consisted of 82
11 participants (29 female, 52 male, 1 not specified), distributed across inductive skewed (N=21),
12 inductive balanced (N=18), deductive skewed (N=25) and deductive balanced (N=18); the total
13 exclusion rates were roughly evenly distributed across inductive balanced (27.36%), inductive
14 skewed (29.3%), deductive balanced (26.33%) and deductive skewed (27.36%). Twenty-two
15 participants reported low-proficiency knowledge of other languages (French, German, Japanese,
17 1 for a summary of proficiency). All provided informed consent and received compensation at a
18 rate of 10 USD/hour. As part of a larger project, participants in the inductive learning condition
19 were invited to complete a second session, which will be reported elsewhere.
21 3.2. Individual differences measures
1 Participants completed a series of individual differences measures to characterize their
2 linguistic profile and working memory span. Basic demographic information was available
7 Language history questionnaire
8 A language history questionnaire was used to gather data on relevant aspects of
9 individuals’ linguistic background, including experience and proficiency with any additional
10 languages. Basic demographic data (age and gender) was obtained from Prolific.
12 Picture Naming
13 The picture naming task was employed to measure participants’ individual lexical ability
14 (based on Gollan et al., 2008) and was employed to control for individual differences in
15 vocabulary skill, by including it as a covariate in the analysis. The task took approximately 5
16 min. Participants saw 80 black and white line drawings, which were presented one at a time in
17 randomized order. In each trial, participants were asked to type the name for the image displayed
18 in a text box. The first nine trials were used as practice. The accuracy of typed responses was
19 coded off-line; up to one character permutation or misspelling was allowed.

22 Participants completed the Operation Span (O-Span) task as a measure of WM. In this
23 task participants were presented with simple math problems alongside a potential solution and
1 were asked to indicate whether the solution was correct or not. The O-Span task was employed
2 given its widespread use in the language learning literature (e.g., Linck & Weiss, 2015; Tagarelli
3 et al., 2011, 2015); and it relies to a lesser extent on verbal skills than other tasks such as the
4 reading span.6 Following each operation, an English word appeared on the screen, which
5 participants should memorize for later recall at the end of the trial. There were three trials at each
6 set size ranging from 2 to 6 word span. The individual score of memory span was calculated as
7 the total number of words correctly recalled. Completing the task took approximately 10 min.7

13 3.3. Materials
6 As noted by an anonymous reviewer, there are a number of possible operationalizations of WM; for instance, in
addition to the O-Span, Tagarelli and colleagues (2011, 2015) also employed a letter-number ordering task (for a
review of WM in SLA see, e.g., Li, 2022; Linck et al., 2014).
Because the WM task involves a verbal component via lexical recall, it is expected that this measure might be
weakly correlated with L1 lexical skill. This was consistent with a correlational analysis performed between WM
(word recall) and English Picture Naming, showing a reliable but weak association (r(80) = 0.28, p = 0.01). As
indicated, the picture naming scores were included in the analysis reported below as a covariate, allowing to control
for individual variability attributable to L1 lexical skill.
7 Despite its short, intensive exposure, the training presented learners with 90 trials of verb-adjective pairings,
providing a substantial amount of exposure to verb-adjective mappings.
2 A list of 50 Spanish adjectives were selected based on previous corpus work reported by
3 Bybee and Eddington (2006), with each half of the list consisting of adjectives respectively
4 associated with ponerse and quedarse. Data from the Corpus del Español (web/dialects section,
5 containing over two billion words) confirmed that the selected adjectives were used preeminently
6 with their corresponding target verb (mean proportion of use with target verb: 89.5%, SD:
7 12.37). Given that the goal was to examine the re-organization of existing concepts into new
8 categories, the use of English translations allowed learners to fully understand the meaning of
9 adjectives, without the considerable burden of learning the meaning of 50 items in a new
10 language. Adjectives were thus translated into English (e.g., caliente “hot”, nervous “nervioso”,
11 muerto “dead”, delgado “slim”, etc.) with contextualized searches of verb+adjective using
12 Linguee (linguee.com), a machine learning translation tool based on a corpus of paired bilingual
13 texts, and were checked with two online bilingual dictionaries (the Collins Spanish Dictionary
14 and WordReference, which are combined on one same site, wordreference.com). From the list of
15 50 adjectives, 10 adjectives were selected for training (half associated with each verb) and the
16 remaining 40 were not trained but were reserved for the generalization task.
17 Two lists of training materials—one for each of the two conditions—were created based
18 on the subset of training items. In the list for the balanced input condition, each adjective was
19 repeated nine times, for a total of 90 training trials. In the list for the skewed input condition, the
20 prototypical adjective within each verb category (i.e., “nervous” for the verb ponerse and “still”
21 for quedarse) was repeated 25 times each, while the rest of the adjectives were repeated 5 times
22 each; that is, the prototypical verbs were five times more frequent than any of the other non-
1 prototypical verbs. For the training phase, a recording of each of the two target Spanish verbs
2 was made by the author, who is a native speaker of Spanish.
4 3.4. Procedure
6 Participants completed one session lasting approximately one hour. They first completed
7 the English Picture Naming task, followed by the Training task, an immediate test and the
8 Generalization task. After this, they completed the O-Span task and language history
9 questionnaire. Participants were assigned to one of the two types of instruction (inductive or
10 deductive) and of input distribution (balanced or skewed).
12 Training task procedure
13 During the training task, participants saw an adjective displayed in the center of the
14 screen, as well as each of the two verbs, one on the bottom left and the other on the bottom right
15 corner of the screen. The position of the verbs was counterbalanced across participants.
16 Participants were instructed to listen to the verb presented auditorily and press a button on their
17 keyboard assigned to each verb; all verb forms were presented in the infinitive. At the beginning
18 of each trial, the adjective and verb were displayed for 2,000 ms; this long interval was selected
19 to encourage participants to pay attention to the trained adjective and actively anticipate the
20 upcoming verb.8 The target verb was then presented auditorily, and participants pressed the
8 The approach employed here focuses on explicit attention to the construction, and explored the effect of different
types of exposure under carefully timed experimental conditions. This was considered an appropriate first step for a
lexical-semantic construction like the Spanish verbs of becoming. The lexical nature of the construction did not
require that additional linguistic context be provided, in contrast with previously tested constructions that targeted
morphosyntax and required full sentences (e.g., Goldberg et al., 2007; McDonough & Nekrasova-Becker, 2014;
Year & Gordon, 2009). Future work in progress will extend the present paradigm by embedding target verb-
adjective pairs in sentences.
1 button on their keyboard corresponding to the location of the target verb (“z” for left, “m” for
2 right). The timing of the stimuli allowed time for participants to anticipate the upcoming verb; as
3 a result, hearing the verb confirmed or disconfirmed their prediction, allowing them to learn from
4 erroneous predictions, even without getting explicit correction (for a recent review on prediction
5 error in L2 learning see e.g., Bovolenta & Marsden, 2021).9
6 Participants had to make a response to advance to the next trial; responses were disabled
7 before the audio for the verb was played. Immediately after a response was recorded, the
8 adjective disappeared and only the verbs remained on display for 300 ms, before the next trial.
10 to familiarize themselves with the tasks; to avoid any descriptive adjectives that might be
11 semantically related to the experimental materials, the proper adjectives “Chilean” and
12 “Mexican” were employed for practice.
15 audio was played 2,000 ms after the adjective was displayed. The position of each of the two
16 verbs on the screen (bottom left and right corners) was counterbalanced across participants, but
17 remained constant for a given participant.
9 Importantly, learning to apply an abstract rule requires that learners be able to relate it to specific instances. For
learners exposed to explicit instructions, the rule guided the re-configuration of adjectives into two new categories
that do not exist in the L1, and therefore each exemplar provides evidence to test whether a given adjective should
be paired with one verb or the other.
2 Importantly, different instructions were presented to participants in each condition.
3 Participants in the inductive learning condition were simply warned that they would see and hear
4 two verbs, both of which were equivalent to “become”, but that Spanish required using one or
5 the other based on the accompanying adjective. Participants were simply asked to do their best to
6 learn the verb-adjective pairing in the task. This was consistent with an inductive learning
7 approach, in which any generalizations are derived directly from a body of observations, without
8 a priori rules that guide input processing (Motha, 2013; Seliger, 1975). In contrast, participants in
9 the deductive learning group were explicitly presented with a “critical rule”, which indicated that
10 ponerse was used with words related in meaning to the word “nervous”, and quedarse about
11 words related to the word “still” (this rule was directly based on the research on verbs of
12 becoming reviewed above by Bybee and Eddington, 2006). They were also warned that they
13 should not try to come up with other rules, as that would confuse them. The instructions text for
14 the training, test and generalization tasks is provided in Appendix B. Completing the training
15 took less than 10 min.
17 Test procedure
18 Immediately after the training task, participants were asked to complete a test using the
19 same procedure as for training, but without the auditory cues guiding selection. This allowed to
20 assess whether participants had learned the verb-adjective combinations during the previous
21 exposure. Each item was presented twice, in order to mitigate the possibility that a participant
22 might correctly guess the correct answer.
1 Generalization task procedure
2 Participants were informed that they would be seeing new un-trained adjectives, and that
3 they should choose the verb that they deemed most appropriate in each case. Critically, as in the
4 training task, participants in the inductive learning group received no additional guidance, while
5 participants in the deductive learning group were reminded of the rule described above.
6 The procedure of the generalization task was very similar to that of the test, with the
7 important difference that the adjectives presented were the rest of the items that had not been
8 previously trained, and each item was presented only once. Participants were given up to 10
9 seconds to make a decision; if no response was made, they were prompted to respond faster. No
10 feedback was provided during this task and, given that it closely mirrored the training task, no
11 practice trials were included.10 Completing the test and generalization tasks took less than 5 min.
13 3.5. Analysis
14 The results from the immediate test revealed that a majority of participants remembered the
15 target verb-adjective pairings with high accuracy following exposure during the training phase
16 (mean: 95.15%, SD: 7.61); there were no significant differences in the immediate test results
17 across the skewed and balanced subgroups (t(69.30) = -0.98, p = 0.33). Participants who failed to
18 reach 70% test accuracy were excluded; these were approximately evenly distributed across the
19 exposure conditions (7 skewed, 9 balanced). Because it would not be possible for learners to
20 generalize on recently learned knowledge unless sufficient knowledge is gained during training,
21 this threshold was set as an minimum level of learned items following exposure upon which to
22 make generalizations; the 70% minimum was selected as it was the cut-off threshold employed
10 Due to experimental error, one item in the ponerse verb list was not displayed during the generalization task (i.e.,
the stimuli displayed contained 19 adjectives for ponerse and 20 for quedarse).
1 in previous work using a similar paradigm to examine the effect of skewed input (McDonough &
2 Trofimovich, 2013), and in previous work in our lab (e.g., Author, 2021) and it provides a
3 practical compromise for accuracy higher than chance (50%) while it avoids setting an overly
4 high threshold.
5 Data from the Generalization task was submitted to a generalized mixed effects
6 regression analysis. Data and script are available at
8 during generalization was employed as the dependent variable. The model included fixed effects
9 for Input distribution (Skewed, Balanced), Instruction type (Inductive, Deductive), as well as
10 individual scores for Test accuracy, English Picture Naming and WM (O-Span), and their two-
11 way interactions with Input distribution and Instruction type; and a three-way interaction for
12 WM, Input distribution and Input type, to test the available cognitive resources hypothesis
13 described above. Following attempts that resulted in convergence failure, the final random-
14 effects structure included random intercepts for subjects and items, as well as by-item random
15 slopes for Learning type. Categorical variables were sum-contrast coded, and continuous
16 variables were centered. Collinearity variance inflation scores were found to be acceptable (< 2.0
17 for all variables). Cronbach's alpha was calculated as a reliability index for the O-Span task and
18 found to be acceptable at α = 0.86 (i.e., ranging from 0.70 to 0.90; Streiner, 2003; Tavakol &
19 Dennick, 2011). Because the raw O-span data had a skewed distribution (skewness = -1.52,
20 kurtosis = -6.74); the analysis was performed on Box-Cox transformed O-Span data (skewness =
21 -0.81, kurtosis = -3.47); this was employed instead of log-transformation, which had the opposite
22 effect (skewness = -2.95, kurtosis = -16.76). More importantly, the residuals of the regression
1 model were normally distributed, as confirmed with the DHARMa package (Hartig, 2022).11 The

11 learning group, and an interaction of WM and Input type within the deductive learning group.
12 Further, the results suggested that skewed input was more beneficial only for learners in the
13 deductive group, but that this effect was reversed at high levels of WM span. To follow up on
14 this interaction, as a first step, the model was re-run using treatment contrasts. With the
15 Instruction Type reference level set to inductive-learning, results for both skewed and balanced
16 input indicated no significant effects of WM or input distribution, and no significant interaction
17 (all p-values > 0.85). In comparison, a main effect of WM emerged only for the deductive
18 balanced exposure (β = 0.64, SE = 0.22 , p < 0.004). Additionally, the output for deductive
19 learning indicated a significant interaction of WM and Input Distribution, suggesting that within
20 deductive learning, WM was associated with higher accuracy for balanced input (β = 0.78, SE =
21 0.28, p < 0.004), but with an opposite polarity effect for skewed input (β = -0.78, SE = 0.28, p <

removing these two outliers did not alter the pattern of results. The results from the full dataset are reported here for
completeness.
1 0.004). The effect of WM in the interaction is further illustrated in Figures 2-3 (the median split
3 WM variable).
4 These results guided the follow-up comparisons with the emmeans package (reported
5 comparisons are FDR-corrected). For WM, comparisons were performed for ± 1 SD from the
6 mean WM scores; this made it possible to examine the effect of WM as a continuous variable,
7 rather than as a dichotomized factor. Post-hoc comparisons for the interaction between WM and
8 Input Distribution revealed no differences within the inductive Instruction Type (all p-values >
9 0.99); in contrast, for deductive learners, comparisons indicated that lower-WM learners exposed
10 to balanced input performed significantly worse than both higher-WM learners also exposed to
11 balanced input (p = 0.021), and lower-WM learners exposed to skewed input (p = 0.037), but
12 was not different from higher-WM learners exposed to skewed input (p = 0.234). Finally,
13 comparisons across Instruction Type at the same level of WM confirmed that, at higher-WM,
14 balanced input led to significantly higher performance for deductive than for inductive learning
15 (p = 0.039), and skewed input at lower-WM was marginally higher for deductive than inductive
16 learning (p = 0.074; for the complete set of FDR-corrected comparisons, see Tables S2-S3 in the
17 appendix).

1 5. Discussion
2 Previous work has produced various findings on the effect of skewed input. While some
3 studies found it to be advantageous (e.g., Casenhiser & Goldberg, 2005; Goldberg et al., 2007;
4 Madlener, 2016; Zhang and Dong, 2019, study 2; Zhang & Mai, 2023, study 2), subsequent L2
5 studies reported either no advantage for skewed input (Nakamura, 2012; Year & Gordon, 2009;
6 Zhang & Mai, 2023, study 1) or even an advantage for balanced input (Brooks et al., 2017;
7 McDonough & Trofimovich, 2013; McDonough & Nekrasova-Becker, 2014; Zhang & Dong,
8 study 1). In line with previous work that explored aptitude-treatment interactions (ATI) in SLA
9 (for a review see, e.g., Vatz et al., 2013), this study explored the effect of individual WM
10 capacity in modulating the effect of skewed and balanced input under inductive and deductive
11 conditions. The experiment reported here capitalized on Spanish verbs of “becoming”, a set of
12 verbs (approximately equivalent to “become” in English) which selectively collocate with
13 subsets of adjectives, requiring L2 learners to develop a new categorization of adjective groups.
14 Specifically, the materials targeted the selection of adjective subsets that collocated with two
15 verbs (ponerse and quedarse), requiring the formation of two new semantic categories for
16 adjectives. The experiment employed a 2 x 2 design, by crossing the instruction type (deductive
17 or inductive—that is, with or without explicit rules, respectively) and input distribution (skewed
18 or balanced) to test the role of each factor, and their potential interaction with WM.
19 A main goal of the study was to test the hypothesis that individual diversity in cognitive
20 resources (specifically, in WM) mediates the effect of skewed input. Couched within evidence in
21 the adult categorization literature and in L2 learning (e.g., DeCaro et al., 2008; Kempe et al.,
22 2010; Tagarelli et al., 2011), I hypothesized that skewed input would facilitate learning when
23 cognitive resources are limited – whether due to learner-internal traits (e.g., lower WM) or to
1 learner-external causes (e.g., when engaging in real-time rule-testing during input processing).
2 On the other hand, under explicit rule-based learning conditions, balanced frequency
3 distributions may provide optimal input to facilitate hypothesis-testing, but only as long as
4 learners’ cognitive resources are on par with task demands. In short, the available cognitive
5 resources hypothesis would predict that, when an explicit rule is being concurrently held in WM,
6 skewed input will tend to benefit low-WM learners, while high-WM learners will benefit from
7 balanced input. This hypothesis is in line with previous studies within the ATI approach, which
8 found that lower-aptitude learners benefitted from reduced variability in the input, in contrast
9 with higher-aptitude learners, who tended to benefit from higher variability in the input (Brooks
10 et al., 2006; Perrachione et al., 2011). The results indeed showed ample variability across
11 conditions based on individual WM, in support of previous ATI research suggesting that learners
12 with different aptitude levels may benefit from learning under different input conditions (e.g.,
13 Brook et al., 2006; Perrachione et al., 2011). Critically, when WM capacity was factored in,
14 variability in subgroups was systematic, and replicated previous seemingly contradictory
15 findings in the literature. The results are discussed next in connection with the three research
16 questions.
17 To recapitulate, the first research question asked whether and how skewed input (i.e.,
18 higher frequency in exposure to a prototypical adjective for each category), facilitates the
19 formation of new L2 categories. The results revealed no main effect of input distribution, with no
20 overall effect of skewed or balanced input exposure. At face value, this result is congruent with
21 later studies that, in contrast to earlier work (e.g., Goldberg et al., 2004, 2007), reported either no
22 advantage for skewed input or even an advantage for balanced input (McDonough &
23 Trofimovich, 2013; McDonough & Nekrasova-Becker, 2014; Nakamura, 2012). However, a
1 beneficial effect of skewed input emerged precisely where predicted by the available cognitive
2 resources hypothesis during the generalization task: After being exposed to deductive training, in
3 which an explicit verbalizable rule was provided, lower-WM learners experienced a significant
4 benefit from reduced variability in the skewed input, while balanced input resulted in lower
5 accuracy for lower-WM learners. This finding supports the proposal originally made by L1
6 researchers that lower variability in skewed input conditions may facilitate the development of a
7 new category through a “pathbreaker” prototypical exemplar. However, an essential qualification
8 must be made in what concerns adult L2 learners, where the effect was far from being present in
9 a majority of learners.
10 Instead, the more common finding in later L2 studies has suggested that a combination of
11 deductive instruction type, in which a verbal rule is explicitly provided, and balanced input might
12 be more conducive to learning, by allowing adult learners to engage in hypothesis testing
13 (McDonough & Trofimovich, 2013). This possibility was directly addressed through the second
14 research question, which asked whether the effect of skewed or balanced input was contingent on
15 the provision of an explicit verbal rule during instruction. This account leads to the
16 straightforward prediction of an interaction between input distribution and instruction type, by
17 which balanced input conditions should become beneficial when combined with an explicit
18 verbal rule that allows for hypothesis testing. Once again, this hypothesis was partly born out,
19 but with a critical qualification. As predicted by the cognitive resources hypothesis, the
20 availability of an explicit rule in combination with balanced input facilitated learning only for
21 those learners with higher WM (recall that at higher-WM, balanced input led to significantly
22 higher performance for deductive than for inductive learning), but not for lower-WM
1 participants. As noted above, for learners with lower WM, when instruction provided explicit
2 rules, skewed input was significantly more beneficial than balanced input.
3 Interestingly, when exposure occurred in the absence of explicit rules, no differences
4 between skewed and balanced input were found. This finding is congruent with data previously
5 reported by Year and Gordon (2009) and McDonough and Trofimovich (2013) who found no
6 contribution of skewed input relative to balanced input in the absence of rules (although in the
7 case of Year and Gordon’s study, the manipulation involved skewed random, rather than skewed
8 first input; see also McDonough & Nekrasova-Becker, 2014, for an advantage of balanced
9 input).
10 Similarly, no significant influence of WM was observed for inductive conditions in the
11 present results. This is despite the fact that learning was quite explicit in all cases, with no other
12 concurrent task nor additional linguistic context. However, the finding that WM did not
13 modulate learning during inductive exposure is in line with the previous work that indicated an
14 effect of WM only when learners were exposed to explicit rules (e.g., Tagarelli, 2001), and
15 which suggested that the absence of rules favored a bottom-up or “information-integration”
16 approach.
18 5.1. Comparison of present and previous findings on the effect of input distributions
19 Altogether, the pattern of results based on learners ranging across the WM spectrum fits
20 well within the previous literature. Crucially, by considering the joint effect of input distribution,
21 instruction type and WM, the present study helps reconcile previous mixed findings. The present
22 data fit well within previous studies that reported aptitude-based interactions and help identify
23 the contexts in which skewed input presents an advantage in adults. In particular, the data
1 provide insight into the cognitive mechanisms that underlie the skewed-input effect, and suggest
2 that populations with lower WM (subsets of adult learners, but also, e.g., younger children) may
3 particularly benefit from exposure to skewed input.
4 Nonetheless, some unanswered questions and discrepancies remain. For example, in
5 some cases, previous data still found an advantage for balanced input in the absence of rules
6 (McDonough & Nekrasova-Becker, 2014). In other cases, balanced input was advantageous with
7 explicit rules but, in the absence of rules, numerically inferior to skewed learning (McDonough
8 & Trofimovich, 2013). Results were also mixed in work from other labs (Namakura, 2012; Year
9 & Gordon, 2009). A relevant aspect that appears to have received little attention is the potential
10 influence of the specific linguistic constructions investigated. For example, Nakamura (2012)
11 examined the influence of skewed and balanced input on the acquisition of the “appearance”
12 construction used in the original studies by Goldberg and colleagues, as well as on the Samoan
13 ergative construction. It seems revealing that, although no clear effect skewed or balanced input
14 was observed for the Samoan ergative, the results did replicate the advantage of skewed input for
15 the “appearance” construction. In this regard, it is worth considering how the input distribution
16 affected linguistic elements across studies. The verbs of becoming construction targeted in the
17 present study may have been more similar to the lexically-based “appearance” construction than
18 some of the morpheme-based constructions examined in other studies (e.g., the Samoan ergative,
19 which is marked by the particle “e”, in Nakamura, 2012; or the Esperanto direct object-marker “-
20 n”, in McDonough & Trofimovich, 2013). Notably (and unlike the lexically-based
21 constructions), in those morpheme-based constructions the skewed/balanced manipulation
22 affected the lexical items that co-occurred with the target particles, but not the distribution of the
23 target particles themselves. While examining and discussing the potential differences across the
1 constructions examined in previous work is beyond the scope of the present paper, this is an
2 aspect that merits further investigation in future studies.
3 Another important issue concerns the question of the conditions that may give rise to an
4 advantage of skewed input. As discussed above, the present study found that, modulated by WM,
5 skewed input influenced learning in the deductive learning condition. In the original studies by
6 Goldberg and colleagues, and advantage of skewed was found in learning conditions that might
7 seem most comparable to the inductive learning condition in the present study, as no explicit rule
8 was provided. Why these differences across Instruction types? It is noteworthy also that,
9 although L2 studies have typically failed to find an effect of skewed input, a previous study by
10 McDonough and Trofimovich (2013) reported a numerical advantage for skewed input in
11 inductive conditions, somewhat resembling the pattern in the original studies by Goldberg and
12 colleagues (e.g., 2004, 2007). It is plausible that differences across studies may also lie in the
13 level of explicitness of learning conditions (as well as, no doubt, on the level of complexity of
14 the linguistic construction under consideration). In the original studies by Goldberg and
15 colleagues, learning was incidental and meaning-oriented during exposure to sentences and
16 visual input. Similarly, McDonough and Trofimovich (2013) employed a meaning-focused task
17 in which learners were presented with pictures and sentences and had to identify the object
18 (rather than the agent). In contrast, given the complexity of the construction targeted, in the
19 present study exposure was more explicit and involved a categorization task. In this study
20 exposure was based on collocations (two-word verb-adjective combinations), rather than on
21 sentences. This lexical approach (without sentences) was employed as a first step because
22 learning the verbs of "becoming" construction does not involve morphosyntax, in contrast with
23 the previous studies that explored morphosyntactic constructions (and thus required stimuli
1 consisting of sentences, e.g., Goldberg et al., 2007; McDonough & Trofimovich, 2013;
2 McDonough & Nekrasova-Becker, 2014; Year & Gordon, 2009). Additionally, no visual aid was
3 employed, given the difficulty of accurately depicting a large number of often related adjectives.
4 The focus on explicit learning of the target categories in the present task (rather than on
5 incidental learning during sentence processing) would seem to have substantially altered the
6 level of attentional resources allocated to the target structure, rather than to meaning processing.
7 That is, because previous meaning-oriented tasks required learners to focus their attention on
8 processing sentence meanings, while attending to visual input, these conditions may have
9 imposed greater demands on WM than in the inductive learning condition employed here.
10 Therefore, in what concerns WM demands, it is not clear that the incidental conditions of
11 previous studies (with no explicit rules) employing multi-modal input are directly comparable to
12 the inductive condition of the present study.12 The question of how different paradigms may
13 impinge on WM resources remains a question for future research to address.
14 Clearly, future work will be needed to replicate and extend the present findings to
15 increase our understanding of how skewed input impacts learning, including in classroom-based
16 settings (e.g., Madlener, 2016). In this sense, the present dataset provides an opportunity to
17 inform future experimental efforts. Based on a power simulation performed on the present
18 dataset with the mixedpower package in R (Kumle et al., 2018), future work seeking to replicate
19 the three-way interaction reported here (with 80% power) may need a sample of ≥140
20 participants.
12 It is also possible that participants under inductive learning conditions may have engaged in rule-searching and
hypothesis testing, even if no explicit rule was provided. In this case, it can be expected that learners would have
come up with rules that may have misled their learning attempts (given difficulties even among experts to formulate
rules for the Spanish verbs of becoming; see, e.g., Ibarretxe-Antuñano & Cheikh-Khamis, 2019). Earlier work has
also shown that engaging in the search for a complex rule without being given the rule, may not be necessarily
conducive to better language learning (Reber, 1976).
2 5.2. Implications for input optimization and personalization
4 At the core of the interest in investigating the potential benefits of skewed L2 input is the
5 idea that the input can be optimized for learning. Ellis (2009) proposed that language learning
6 can be regarded as a sampling problem, in that speakers must develop linguistic representations
7 based on limited data. Given the limited exposure to input affecting L2 speakers in particular,
8 designing input based on criteria such as function, frequency, representativeness, among others,
9 seems of particular importance. This proposal is in line with research conducted within an ATI
10 approach during the last two decades or so (e.g., Vatz et al., 2013; DeKeyser, 2019), which
11 suggested that input optimality may be relative to individual traits. For instance, in a study that
12 examined L2 learners’ ability to learn tone contrasts, Perrachione et al. (2011) found that higher
13 variability in exposure to multiple speakers helped learners with high acoustic perception acquire
14 L2 tones; however, for learners with lower acoustic perceptual abilities, high-variability training
15 was in fact detrimental, and they benefited from reduced variability instead. Research by Brooks
16 et al., (2006) found that a cognitive measure of executive function predicted the extent to which
17 individual participants learning Russian gender benefitted from greater lexical variability in the
18 input. The approach taken here adds evidence indicating that, even if each individual is exposed
19 to the same stimuli, input efficacy should be expected to vary systematically based on individual
20 cognitive traits, and specifically WM.
21 The implications of the present and previous studies that revealed ATIs are potentially
22 far-reaching, suggesting that no one type of input is beneficial across the board, but that
23 optimized input must necessarily be, to some extent, individualized input. This approach opens
1 opportunities for L2 researchers to identify the contexts that may trigger specific learning
2 pathways and engage alternative systems to achieve a similar outcome (Ashby et al., 1998;
3 Green et al., 2006). Relying on well-established constructs in psycholinguistics –such as WM
4 (Tagarelli et al., 2001), executive control (Chen et al., 2023) or acoustic perception (Perrachione
5 et al., 2011)— should allow to develop a systematic program of research on the optimization of
6 input. Future work should also consider other well-studied individual-differences measures in the
7 SLA literature --e.g., language analytic ability or metalinguistic awareness (Jessner, 2008; Ranta,
8 2002). In sum, taking into consideration diversity among learners is a pre-requisite to develop a
9 more inclusive science of L2 learning.
11 6. Conclusion
13 By investigating diversity in cognitive skill –specifically, WM— among L2 learners, the
14 present study found significant variability in the type of input that could be considered as
15 “optimal” for L2 category learning. Following training in learning conditions that exposed
16 participants to skewed or balanced input, and with or without explicit rules, the results indicated
17 an important role on individual WM capacity in modulating the type of input that improved
18 learning gains for subgroups of individuals. While the availability of explicit rules tended to
19 enhance learning gains, in line with previous work, its combination with balanced input was
20 detrimental for lower-WM learners, while being beneficial only for high-WM individuals.
21 Altogether, the results help clarify variety of results in previous research, and suggest that the
22 issue of what L2 input is optimal for learning must be examined in conjunction with individual
23 variability in cognitive resources.

13 Instructions for Training task:
14 Inductive and Deductive conditions:
15 "This is an experiment investigating language learning. In this task, you will see English
16 words presented on the screen as text. These words will be adjectives (i.e., descriptor words such
17 as "beautiful", "small", "big", "difficult"). In addition, you will also *hear* one of two Spanish
18 verbs in each screen ("ponerse" and "quedarse"). Both Spanish verbs translate as "become" in
19 English, but Spanish requires that you sometimes use one verb and sometimes the other,
1 depending on the particular adjective. Your task is to listen to the verb and select the correct
2 verb, while trying to learn what Spanish verb to use with each English word.
3 The experiment contains two short practice blocks before the experimental block. The
4 whole task takes less than 10 minutes. There will be one break during the main task."
6 Additional rule provided for Deductive condition only: "In addition to the examples,
7 there is one critical RULE: One category is associated with the verb "ponerse". These are words
8 that are related to the word "nervous" and are to some extent similar in meaning. The other
9 category is associated with the verb "quedarse". This group of words is related to the word
10 "still". You shouldn't try to come up with other rules, as that will confuse you! The rule to
11 remember is that "ponerse" is about words related to "nervous", and "quedarse" about words
12 related to "still"."
14 Instructions for Test following training: "Now you will complete a test. This will look
15 very similar to the training you just completed. However, you will *not* hear what verb each
16 word should go with. Do your best to remember and choose the correct verb"
18 Instructions for Generalization task: "This task is related to a previous task in which you
19 practiced selecting and learning what Spanish verb to use with different adjectives. This task will
20 work the same way. But this time you will see different adjectives and you will *not* be told
21 what verb is correct.
22 Your task will be to select the verb that seems most appropriate based on the critical rule
23 that you learned.
1 REMEMBER: "Ponerse" will be associated with words that are related to the word
2 "nervous" and are to some extent similar in meaning. # "Quedarse" is associated with words
3 related to the word "still". You shouldn't try to come up with other rules, as that will confuse
4 you. Do your best to categorize words based on this rule."
