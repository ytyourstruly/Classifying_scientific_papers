Abstract: We investigated (1) what psychological (e.g., five big personality traits, self-esteem) and
social-demographic factors contribute to the prevalence and intensity of drug use in the Netherlands
and (2) the impact of taking illicit drugs on individuals’ (N=1170) health, labour market performance
and financial wealth. First, analyses of various factors showed that emotional stability, employment
status, urban character of the place of residence, number of children, gender, and compliance with
parents can predict individuals’ drug use concurrently. Particularly, emotional stability, employment
and gender can still predict drug use four years later, even when the concurrent baseline of drug use
has been additionally controlled for. Instrumental variable analysis suggested that emotional stability
may have a causal effect. Furthermore, we showed that, controlling for standard demographic factors,
self-control, patience, risk aversion, IQ, etc., taking drugs negatively relate to participants’ physical
health (e.g., general health, BMI, disease days, diabetes, and recurrent complaints) and mental health
(e.g., feeling more depressed and anxious; less happy or calm), as well as predicts a significantly lower
employment possibilities, income, and financial wealth than non-drug users. Our results not only show
the consequences of taking drugs for different aspects of well-being, but also suggest that an
intervention for drug users may also give more importance to their emotional stability and employment
opportunities.

1. Introduction
Even if one has no lifetime experience of taking any drugs, they must have heard of the tolerant Dutch
policy towards substance use. Adults can buy cannabis for individual consumption in the so-called
‘coffee shops’, while taking cannabis is not considered illegal. Despite the great tolerance, one cannot
deny an intuitive feeling that taking drugs may negatively correlate with health, education attainment,
workplace safety, and labour market success (e.g., Fergusson, Horwood, & Ridder, 2005; Kaestner &
Grossman, 1995; see a review in van Ours & Williams, 2015). Furthermore, the prevalence of drug
use associates with various factors such as individual demographic information, social environment,
cultural normalization, etc. (Kunst & Gebhardt, 2018; see a review in Dennhardt & Murphy, 2013).
However, we have an incomplete understanding of the (causal) effect of factors contributing to
substance use and whether substance use has a causal negative impact on wellbeing. The goal of the
present study is to better understand the characteristics of people who take drugs and the impact of
substance use on health, labour market performance and financial wealth.
Studies on factors contributing to drug use and its consequences for wellbeing mostly have three
problems. First, some studies use simple correlation analyses and the associations between factors and
the prevalence of drug use disappear when social demographic factors and more individual
characteristics are controlled for (e.g., Kunst & Winifred, Gebhardt, 2018). Even if researchers attempt
to consider as many influential factors as possible, there could still be an omitted variable that
influences both the drug use and a dependent variable. Therefore, a significant factor that relates to
drug use can just be a mediator or confounds with other factors. Similarly, a correlation between the
drug use and labour market performance or health can also be spurious. Even if there is an effect, the
correlation direction can be both. For example, emotionally unstable may lead to take drugs (Dennhardt
& Murphy, 2013) whereas drug use may also affect emotionally stability. The adverse influence of
drug use on health can also be reverse.
However, there is only a small number of literatures that aim to better understand the causal
consequences of taking drugs for health, labour market success and education attainment in economics.
The surprisingly lack of econometric research that focuses on the question of causality may be due to
the undesirable data set (van Ours, & Williams, 2015). Economists often rely on the method of
instrumental variables (IV) to account for the abovementioned potential sources of endogeneity. A
valid instrument induces changes in the independent variable but has no independent effect on the
dependent variable (Angrist, Imbens & Rubin, 1994). Such an econometric method may help to
uncover the causal effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. For example,
researchers use the starting age of taking drug (e.g., Palali & van Ours, 2013), perceived self-esteem,
living environment, parental education, number of siblings, local drug prices, difficulty in obtaining
illicit substances, etc as instrumental variables (see a review in van Ours, 2013). Alternatively, van
Ours (2013) used an approach combining information about drug use dynamics and current
employment status (a bivariate mixed proportional hazard model with a flexible baseline hazard).
The present study will first investigate how various social-demographic, psychological, and social
norm factors may jointly influence individuals’ drug use. We will show individuals’ emotional stability
and employment status predict their prevalence and intensity of drug use concurrently. Our study tries
to reduce potential omitted variables by controlling for more individual characteristics such as
personality, self-control, risk aversion and seeks causal effects by using an instrumental variable
approach. To account for the potential problem of endogeneity of emotional stability, we used a two-
step estimator for the probit model (Newey, 1987) for a binary dependent variable (whether taking
drugs) and ivtobit for the non-negative dependent variable (intensity of taking drugs) with two
instruments: IQ and whether the participant has retired. Research shows that a higher IQ significantly
relates to better emotional stability (Gow et al., 2005), but we do not expect a correlation between IQ
and the prevalence of taking drugs. Retirement can lead to an increase in emotional stability (Schwaba
& Bleidorn, 2019), but not in drug use especially when age is controlled for (Bacharach et al., 2008).
We do not have a good instrument for employment, but to deal with possible reverse causal effects,
we examine whether employment status and emotional stability can still predict the prevalence and
intensity of drug use four years later after accounting for the original baseline.
Furthermore, we examine the impact of substance use on health and labour market performance, as
well as for the first time on financial wealth. Considering the potential problem of endogeneity of
taking drugs, we used a two-step estimator for the probit model for binary dependent variables and
2SLS for linear regression models with different types of instruments: the extent to which a participant
complies with parents, whether having a child, and the urban character of the place of residence. First,
individuals who comply with parents are less likely to take substances (Kunst & Gebhardt, 2018; van
den Bos, Blaauw & Bieleman, 2022). Second, people who have a child take fewer drugs or smoke less,
but whether having a child is unlikely to affect dependent variables such as income. For example,
having a child was used as an instrument for the effect of smoking on income (van Ours, 2004). Third,
Palali and van Ours (2015) found that individuals living more than 20 km from a municipality with a
cannabis shop are less likely to take cannabis or at least have a lower starting rate of cannabis use.
Given that the distance to coffee shops affects the accessibility of drugs, we use the information of
participants’ urban character of place of residence for the third instrumental variable. Furthermore,
self-esteem is found to have a causal effect on drug use (Ahlgren & Norem-hebeisen, 1979), following
Kaestner (1994a) we also use it as an instrument in the analysis of labour market performance.
The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 first summarises factors that may influence drug taking
and then review studies on the effect of drug use on health and labour market performance. Section 3
describes our survey and the data. Section 4 gives the results of regressions. Section 5 concludes with
a discussion.
2. Background
2.1 Factors related to the prevalence of taking drugs
There are generally three categories of variables that relate to the prevalence of drug use: demographic
factors, psychological influences, and social normalisation. First, males or people who identify as gay,
lesbian, or bisexual are more likely to take drugs (e.g., Boyd, McCabe, & d’Arcy, 2003; Compton,
Thomas, Stinson, & Grant, 2007; Kunst, Bachrach, & Bekker, 2015; Reed, Prado, Matsumoto, &
Amaro, 2010; Seedat et al., 2009). Being of non-Western ethnicity increases the probability of last
year’s cannabis use by 4.2 times whereas being of Western ethnicity decreases the probability of last
year’s cannabis use (Wouters & Benschop, 2012). People of particular religions may also take fewer
drugs as some religions are against drug use (Hammermeister, Flint, Havens, & Peterson, 2001; Helm,
Boward, McBride, & Del Rio, 2002).
A number of psychological factors associated with substance use have been uncovered. For example,
curiosity is self-reported as a major motivation for trying out drugs, at least for Dutch university
students (van den Bos, Blaauw & Bieleman, 2022). A meta-analysis on the role of Five Big personality
traits in drug use showed that people who take drugs are associated with being more neurotic and less
extraverted, conscientious, and agreeable than nondrug users (Kotov, Gamez, Schmidt, & Watson,
2010). However, a survey of party-drug use in Dutch university students did not find a significant
association between five big personality traits/ impulsiveness and lifetime or regular party-drug use
(Kunst & Gebhardt, 2018). Additionally, risk aversion seems to correlate with one’s drug taking.
Individuals who have subjective beliefs that substance use is less risky for health are likely to have a
lower perceived risk and thus decide to take drugs (Uriely & Belhassen, 2005). All these relationships
are associations and there are studies claiming impulsivity and low self-esteem have a causal effect on
substance addiction (Ahlgren & Norem-hebeisen, 1979; Verdejo-Garcia, Lawrence, & Clark, 2008).
Furthermore, social normalisation such as availability and accessibility of drugs, social and cultural
accommodation of illicit drug use can have an impact. For example, Palali and van Ours (2015) found
that distances to coffee shops affect the accessibility of drugs. Specifically, individuals who grew up
within 20 km of a cannabis shop have a lower age of onset of cannabis use (but also see a
counterexample in Wouters, Benschop, van Laar & Korf, 2012). Individuals who have lenient
injunctive norms among friends correlate with being regular party-drug users. Particularly, using
MDMA/Ecstasy usually occurs together with a partner. By contrast, an individual who complies with
parents is a strong negative predictor of drug use (Kunst & Gebhardt, 2018; van den Bos, Blaauw &
Bieleman, 2022). Nevertheless, most studies do not consider different aspects of factors together due
to the practical reason of information being unavailable. Many studies simply ignore participants’
social-economic status and some important demographic information such as income. Also the
majority of studies show associations between factors and drug use (e.g., Kunst & Gebhardt, 2018;
Uriely & Belhassen, 2005; van den Bos, Blaauw & Bieleman, 2022) but only very few aim to establish
a causal link (e.g., Ahlgren & Norem-hebeisen, 1979; Palali and van Ours, 2015).
2.1 Direct health effects of substance use
There are a large number of studies in epidemiology and medical literature showing that drug use (e.g.,
cannabis or even party-drug use) has an adverse effect on physical and mental health (e.g., Devlin &
Henry, 2008; Schep et al., 2012). For example, illicit drug users may have an earlier onset of diabetes
(Sheldon & Quin, 2005), and stimulant use is related to heart conditions (e.g., cocaine; Phillips et al.,
2009). Weekly and last year cannabis users had 18% and 8% lower probability of being in very good
or excellent health than those who had not taken any drugs (Williams & Skeels, 2006). Van Ours and
Williams (2012) showed that cannabis had a significantly negative but small effect on the physical
well-being of men. Furthermore, cannabis increases the probability of mental health problems (e.g.,
Macleod et al., 2004; van Ours & Williams, 2011) such as leading to depression (Degenhardt et al.,
2003). Van Ours, Williams, Fergusson and Horwood (2013) found that intensive cannabis use by males
(several times per week) causes a higher rate of suicidal ideation.
However, studies on drug use and health consequences have some limitations. First, the adverse effect
of taking drugs on health is not always consistent across studies. For example, research on the effect
of cannabis use on cancer (e.g., the lungs, upper respiratory tract, head, and neck) showed mixed
findings (Hashibe et al., 2005; Mehra et al., 2006), and research on cannabis smoking and emphysema
showed no increase in the risk of emphysema (Aldington et al., 2007; Tashkin, 2001). A recent survey
of Dutch university students on the association between party-drug use and problems found that taking
drugs at a party associates with mild health/psychosocial problems such as feeling ill and doing
embarrassing things, but rarely relates to serious impairment or consequences on health or social
function (e.g., being hospitalized) (Kunst & Gebhardt, 2018). Furthermore, the causal relationship
between drug use and health is far from clear. On the one hand, there may be an omitted variable
influencing both drug use and poor health that has not been accounted for. Thus the associations found
can be spurious as there is no direct relationship between drug use and health, but only an indirect one
that mediates via the common (unobserved) characteristics. On the other hand, even if there is a causal
effect, the relationship can run reversely from poor health to drug use. For example, a patient
undergoing medical treatment may need to use cannabis (see more discussions in van Ours & Williams,
2015).
2.2 Substances use and labour market performance
Despite the richness of literatures on the relationship between drug use and labour market performance,
findings are rather unclear. First, early studies found that drug use, instead of having a negative impact,
increases wages (Gill & Michaels, 1992; Kaestner, 1991; Register & Williams; 1992), or does not
systematically influence labour supply or wages (Kaestner, 1994b, c). The findings (counter-intuitive)
were difficult to understand, and these studies were criticized as to the validity of their instruments
(van Ours & Williams, 2015).
As pointed out by van Ours and Williams (2015), a second wave of economics research on the effect
of drug use on labour market performance mushroomed from 1998 onwards. These studies generally
aim to improve previous research by focusing on finer-grained research questions such as the impact
of drug intensity; the timing of drug use (immediate or long-term effect); and the causal impact of drug
use on labour market success. However, the results are still mixed: Some researchers found that
infrequent or nonproblematic drug use has no impact on employment (van Ours, 2006) or wages
(Conti, 2010), whereas some others did find a negative impact on wages (e.g., Burgess & Propper,
1998; DeSimone, 2002; van Ours, 2007; Zarkin et al., 1998). It is still inconclusive as to whether there
is a negative impact of drug use on labour market performance in general.
3. Data
3.1 Data collection and description
We designed a special questionnaire with a set of questions including demographic information, IQ
(Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices Test, Raven, 1976; shortened version, Bilker et al., 2012),
self-control, time preference (patience), language proficiency, cultural values towards time, retirement
planning, risk aversion (van Rooij et al., 2011), financial knowledge (Lusardi & Mitchell, 2008), etc.
Results of analyses of some variables that are unrelated to drug use (e.g., retirement planning, language
proficiency) will be reported in other papers. The questionnaire was administered to 1471 participants
in the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) in Dutch, administered by
CenterData (Tilburg University, The Netherlands) in 2016. In addition, we obtained participants’
background information such as whether they had a paid job, the amount of their monthly net income
and their financial wealth.
Our data on drug use came from Waves 9 and 13 of the Tobacco, Alcohol, Drug use, in Health of LISS
panel. The data were collected in 2016 and 2020. Individuals were asked whether they ever used one
or more of the substances (soft drugs such as hashish, marijuana; hard drugs such as stimulants,
cocaine, heroin; XTC; hallucinogens such as LSD, magic mushrooms; sedatives such as Valium) in
the past month (1-never; 2-sometimes; 3-regularly). Those who had reported taking any drugs would
be further asked about the intensity of their use of these substances over the past month. Furthermore,
we found information about participants’ mental and psychical health in the same waves, and we
focused on the following questions:
1. How would you describe your health, generally speaking? (1-5, from poor to excellent).
2. How many days during the last month were you unable to go to work, perform housekeeping
work or attend school, due to disease? (1 = 0 days; 2 = 1 or 2 days; 3 = 3 to 5 days; 4 = 5 to 10
days; 5 = more than 10 days).
3. How tall are you? How much do you weigh, without clothes and shoes? We computed a Body
2 2
Max Index (BMI) = kg/m , where kg is a person’s weight in kilograms; m is the height in
metres squared (World Health Organization, 2005).
4. Has a physician told you this last year that you suffer from diabetes (0 = No; 1 = Yes).
5. Do you regularly suffer from: (back-, knee-, hip-pain or pain in any other joint; heart
complaints or angina, pain in the chest due to exertion; short of breath, problems with
breathing; coughing, a stuffy nose and/or flu-related complaints; stomach or intestinal
problems; headache; fatigue; sleeping problems; other recurrent complaints; no recurrent
complaints) (0 = no; 1 = yes)
6. Please choose the answer that best describes how you felt during this past month (1 = never; 2
= seldom; 3 = sometimes; 4 = often; 5 = mostly; 6 = continuously):
a. I felt depressed and gloomy
b. I felt very anxious
c. I felt so down that nothing could cheer me up
d. I felt calm and peaceful
e. I felt happy
Our data on the psychological measures of the Big Five Personality Traits (Goldberg, 1992) and self-
esteem (Rosenberg, 1965) were from Waves 8-9 of the LISS Core Study Personality. The LISS panel
did not collect information on these two measurements in 2016 but collected information half a year
before our survey (Nov 2015) and one year later (2017). Past research has shown that the five big
personality traits are stable in a short time span of 4 years (Cobb-Clark & Schurer, 2012) or during
adulthood (Rantanen et al., 2007), thus we computed mean scores between scores obtained in 2015
and 2017 namely for five big personality traits and self-esteem measurements.
There were 1177 respondents (Mage = 46.69, range 25-66 years; 646 females, 531 males) for the
survey we collected in 2016, including 659 immigrants (361 first-generation and 298 second-
generation immigrants). We merged information of our respondents with their information of
personality, health, labour market performance and drug use in the LISS panel in 2016 and 2020. There

3.2 Planned analysis
Dependent variables
Health
Physical health (Q1-5): General health situation (health), days of disease (diseasedays), body mass
index (BMI), whether having diabetes (diabetes) and whether having recurrent complaints
(no_complaint) listed in Q5.
Mental health (Q6a-6e): participants’ degree of feeling depressed (depressed), anxious (anxious), upset
(upset), calm (calm) and happy (happy) during the past month.
Labour market performance and financial wealth: employment status of whether having a paid job
(paidwork16); net monthly income and financial wealth which were log-transformed (logincome16;
logfinassets16).
Prevalence and intensity of substance use: (1) whether taking drugs last month (=1 if never; otherwise
(sometimes and regularly) = 0, and (2) the intensity of taking all drugs (adding times of all substance
use), each labelled with the year 2016 or 2020 (nodrug16; nodrug20; drugintensity16;
drugintensity20).
Independent variables
We generated the following independent variables: log-transformed monthly net income
(logincome16), employment status of whether having a paid job (paidwork16), having a partner
(partner), female, age, number of children (childnum), risk aversion, seven immigrant group dummies
(Turkey, Morocco, Dutch Antilles, Surinam, Indonesia, other non-Western and other-Western) and
other individual characteristics of IQ, education level (high; middle, low), patience (time preference)
and self-control, etc. To study the effects of personality on drug use, we generated Extraversion,
Agreeable, Conscientious, Emotional Stability and Imagination for the five big personality traits, and
Rosenberg’s esteem scale (SelfEsteem).
We conducted two sensitivity analyses: First, we used the instrumental variable approach to shed light
on the causal effect of certain personalities on the prevalence of using drugs and the causal effect of
drug use on health, income and wealth. For the effect of personality emotional stability on drug use,
we used retirement and IQ as instruments; for the consequences of drug use on wellbeing, we used
different types of instruments for nodrug: (1) the extent to which participants agreed with the statement
“Present day youth need to keep the values of their parents and grandparents (1-9;1 = disagree
completely; 9 = agree totally)” (complyparents). (2) the number of children (childrenum) or sometimes
whether having a child (childyes). (3) whether living in an extremely urban area (=1; otherwise = 0,
extr_urban) generated from participants’ urban character of place of residence (1 = Extremely urban;
2 = Very urban; 3 = Moderately urban; 4 = Slightly urban; 5 = Not urban) and (4) self-esteem.
Furthermore, in a second sensitivity analyses, we ran the same regressions on dependent variables
while controlling for other individual characteristics such as risk aversion, self-control, patience (time
preference), IQ, etc.
Probit models were used to study the binary dependent variables. Tobit regressions were used to
examine the intensity of drug use, with the dependent variables drugintensity16 and drugintensity20,
as the dependent variables were non-negative with a large number of 0. OLS models were used for the
dependent variables of rating data, as 2SLS instrument variable approach could be applied.

Predictors of whether taking any drugs
Conscientious, Emotion Stability, Self Esteem, and complying with parents, as well as demographic
features of employment status, age, children number, living in extremely urban areas, and having a
partner were significantly correlated with taking no drugs (nodrug16). However, the logistic
regression with all independent variables of five big personality traits, self-esteem, and demographic
information combined in a model showed that only emotional stability (p = .007), employment status
(p = .041), age (p = .048), children number (p = .003), living in extremely urban areas (p = .020) and
complying with parents (p = .043) were of significant influences. Individuals who were more
emotionally stable, employed, older and had more children, complied with parents, and lived in areas
that were not extremely urban in 2016 had a lower probability of taking drugs, keeping other factors
constant. In a cross-cultural comparison, immigrants from other Western countries were found to be
less likely to use drugs than native Dutch (p = .029). Additionally, gender was marginally significant
living in extremely urban areas, and gender.
When predicting the situation in 2020, only emotional stability (p = .002), gender (p = .013) and
living extremely urban (p = .03) were still significant. Emotion stability (p = .018) and living in
extremely urban areas (p = .079) remained to be (marginally) significant in 2020 even when the
baseline nodrug16 (p < .001) was additionally controlled for. In this model, Surinam had a
significantly higher prevalence of taking drugs than Dutch natives, whereas other groups did not

Predictors of the intensity of taking drugs
Simple correlation analysis showed that in 2016 emotional stability, risk aversion, employment
status, number of children and having a partner were negatively correlated with the intensity of
taking drugs in the previous month while Surinam immigrants and living in extremely urban areas
had positive correlations. Results of a Tobit model regression with all independent variables
combined in one model showed that emotional stability (p = .006), employment status (p = .036),
number of children (p = .003), gender (p = .049) and living extremely urban (p = .006) significantly
predicted the intensity of taking drugs (Tables 3-4). Specifically, those who were more emotionally
stable, had a job, were female, had more children and lived in areas that were not extremely urban
were less likely to be intensive drug users. Factors such as complying with parents (p = .08), being
other western (p = .065) or other non-western immigrants (p = .076) were marginally significant,
suggesting that individuals who complied with their parents, being other western and non-western
immigrants (compared with Dutch natives) tended to take drugs less frequently. Furthermore,
emotional stability (p = .006), gender (p = .007), living in a densely populated area (p = .023), and
employment status (p = .088) still (marginally) significantly predicted the situation in 2020. Surinam
immigrants tended to take drugs more frequently than Dutch natives (p = .099) in 2020. In addition,
the effects of emotional stability (p = .026), employment status (p = .043) remained to be significant
even when the baseline of drugintensity16 (p < .001) was additionally controlled for, and the effect
of age (p = .045), female (p = .066), and high education (p = .059) were marginally significant.
These results suggest that emotional stability, employment status, living location, gender, education,
number of children and age are important factors that contribute to the intensity of drug use.

First for the IV analysis of Emotional stability for the prevalence of drug use, in the first-stage
regression of ivprobit, the model was highly significant, F(25, 770) = 33.25, p < .001, adjusted R =
0.504, where instruments IQ (β = .05, p = .008) and retired (β = .19, p = .011) were also significant
χ (1) = 1.40, p = .24.
Furthermore, in the second stage, the null hypothesis of the Wald test of exogeneity of emotional
stability could not be rejected χ (1) = .49, p = .48, indicating that there was no significant evidence of
an endogeneity problem in the analysis of the prevalence of drugs (nodrug16). The result of
emotional stability still held when we used ivprobit to do the prediction of 2020 while controlling for
the 2016 condition (overidentification test, p = .23; Wald test of exogeneity, p = .87). The
EmoStability in the second stage in 2016 or 2020 was not significant (β =-.47, SD = 1.24, p = 0.71
and β = 77, SD = 1.92, p = 0.69). These results suggests that the results assuming exogeneity are
consistent and efficient, and if we believe that emotional stability is not endogenous, then the effects
causal effects.
Similarly for the frequency of taking drugs when ivtobit was applied to Emotional stability for the
dependent variable drugintensity16, in the first stage (F(25, 770) = 33.25, p < .001, adjusted R =
0.504) the two types of instruments were significant (IQ, p = .008; retired, p = .011) and they passed
the overidentification test (Amemiya-Lee-Newey minimum χ (1) = .06, p = .80). In the second stage,
the estimate and standard error for EmoStability were surprisingly large β = 20.85, SD =34.81, p =
test of exogeneity were not significant (χ (1) = .97, p = .32), indicating that there is no significant
evidence of an endogeneity problem for emotional stability. The result was robust when analyzing
the dependent variable drugintensity20 while controlling for the 2016 baseline (overidentification
test, p = .076; endogeneity test, p = .72). In short, the IV analysis suggests that there might be a
causal effect of emotional stability on the prevalence and intensity of substances.
Sensitivity analysis 2: Regressions additionally controlling for IQ, self-control and patience
We ran regression models with dependent variables drug use (nodrug16, nodrug20,
nodrug20_ctrl16) and drug intensity (drugintensity16, drugintensity20, intensity20_ctrl16) while
the effects of emotional stability were persistently significant in all models (except one that became
marginally significant). The results of employment status and living in extremely urban areas were
largely robust. In addition, none of these three additional control variables was significant in any
models (all p > .05). In short, these results showed that emotional stability, employment, living
location, and complying with parents, as well as demographic factors of gender, age, and number of
children, play a vital role in predicting participants’ prevalence and intensity of drug use.

any substances. In terms of physical health, regression analyses revealed that abstaining from substances
significantly predicted a better self-assessed general health status (β = .24, p = .014, N = 928), higher
BMI (β = 1.53, p = .008, N = 924), smaller chance of having diabetes (β = -.60, p = .024, N = 886) or
fewer recurrent complaints (β = .44, p = .022, N = 925), and fewer days of diseases during last month (β
= -1.56, p < .001, N = 928), while controlling for age, gender, education, income, employment status,
and country dummies. Similarly for mental health, participants who had no substances were
significantly less likely to feel depressed (β = -.35, p = .006, N = 808), anxious (β = -.52, p < .001, N =
808), upset (β = -.37, p = .007, N = 808), but more likely to feel happy (β = .37, p = .007, N = 808) and
calm (β = .33, p = .015, N = 808), while controlling for age, gender, education, income, employment
status, partner, emotional stability and country dummies. These results indicate that the use of
substances is significantly negatively related to participants’ physical and mental health.

Predicting employment, income and financial wealth
The proportion of having a paid job for participants who did not take drugs was about 20% higher than
that non-drug users were significantly more likely to have a paid job than drug users (β = .66, p = .001,
N = 928), keeping education, gender, partner, age, income and country dummies constant. In addition,
the mean net monthly income of participants who did not take any substances was 291.61 euros higher
than that of those who took drugs. An OLS regression revealed that the effect of non-drug use on
income was significant (β = .58, p = .04, N = 942), even after controlling for participants’ education,
gender, age, country dummies and whether had a partner. Furthermore, the mean financial wealth of
non-drug users was € 9980 more than that of drug users. An OLS regression with financial wealth as a
dependent variable shows that, after controlling for financial knowledge, age, gender, income, education
and country dummies, non-drug use is significantly positive (β = 1.15, p = .028, N = 609). In short, drug
use seems to have a negative impact on participants’ employment possibilities, monthly net income, and
financial wealth.
Sensitivity analysis 1: Estimation using instrumental variables
We had three instruments (i.e., childyes, extre_urb, complyparent), and we used Stata estat firststage
command to examine whether they were weak instruments. Take the dependent variable overall health
assessment (health) as an example, the minimum eigenvalue statistic showed that childyes F(1,913) =
18.66, p < .0001 and extre_urb F(1,906) = 14.38, p = .0002, and the null hypothesis of being a weak
instrument can be rejected if we are willing to accept an actual rejection rate of a Wald test at the 5%
level of at most 10% or 15%, with a reference to the critical values from the stock-yogo test (2SLS size
of nominal 5% Wald test) at the rejection rate of 10% (16.38) or 15% (8.98). However, for the
instrument complyparent (F(1,913) = 8.12, p = .0045), we cannot reject the null hypothesis of being a
weak instrument if we are willing to accept a rejection rate of at most 15% (8.12 < critical value 8.98).
Additionally, for a single endogenous regressor an F-statistic below 10 is cause for concern (Staiger and
Stock (1997, p. 557), so we only used childyes and extre_urb as instruments.
For the overall health assessment (health), BMI and disease days, the overidentification test did not

reject the validity of both instruments (health: Sargan χ (1) = .056, p = .813; Basmann χ (1) = .055, p
2 2 2
= .815; BMI: Sargan χ (1) = .147, p = .702; Basmann χ (1) = .144, p = .704; disease days: Sargan χ (1)
= .61, p = .435; Basmann χ (1) = .60, p = .439). The stock-yogo test rejected the null hypothesis of being
a weak instrument if we are willing to accept a rejection rate of at most 15% (minimum eigenvalue
statistic F (2, 905) = 14.67 > critical value 11.59, p < .0001). The null hypothesis of the Durbin-Wu-
Hausman test (a test of exogeneity of prevalence of taking drug) could not be rejected (health: Dubin χ
(1) = .006, p = .94, Wu-Hausman, F (1,905) = .006, p = .94; BMI: Dubin χ (1) = .597, p = .440, Wu-
Hausman, F (1,901) = .587, p = .444; disease days: Dubin χ (1) = 1.38, p = .240, Wu-Hausman, F
(1,901) = 1.36, p = .241), indicating that there was no significant evidence of an endogeneity problem
for the analyses of general health, BMI or disease days. These results appear to suggest that we may rely
on the results of the original OLS model. Thus, the results assuming exogeneity may be consistent and
efficient, and the effects of taking drugs on general health, BMI, and the last-month number of disease
variables health, BMI and disease days.

Furthermore, for outcomes of whether having diabetes and norecurrent_complaint, we need to deal with
the probit model with binary endogenous variable, so we used the extended probit regression (Stata
command ‘eprobit’). The results showed that the instruments were significant (all ps < .011) when the
dependent variable was nodrug16, and the correlation of the errors from the prevalence of taking drugs
(nodrug16) equation and those from the diabetes or norecurrent_complaint equation was estimated to be
factors that increased the chance of taking drugs also increased the chance of having recurrent
complaints or diabetes was not supported. So we can rely on results from the original probit models.

As for the labour market success and wealth, we have one additional instrument Self-Esteem. For the
analysis of employment, we used the extended probit regression with instruments Self-Esteem, and
childyes (as suggested in the literature). Both instruments are found to be significant for the prevalence
of taking drugs (nodrug16), and the hypothesis that unobservable factors that increased the chance of
taking drugs also increased the chance of having no paid job was not supported (p = .19), indicating that
instruments and the overidentification test did not reject the validity of instruments (p > .56). The
minimum eigenvalue statistic of instruments for the first stage was F(4,789) = 10.76, p < .001, and the
null hypothesis that the instruments are weak were rejected if we are willing to tolerate a 10% relative
bias of the 2SLS estimator (10.76 > critical value 10.27). In addition, the null hypothesis of the
Hausman test could not be rejected (χ (13) = 15.66, p = .27), suggesting that there was no significant
evidence of an endogeneity problem of nodrug16 for the analysis of income. Therefore, the effect of
taking drugs on income may also be interpreted as causal effects. Finally for financial wealth, we used
instruments (childrenum and SelfEsteem), which were significant in the first stage (minimum eigenvalue
statistic of instruments for the first stage was F(2, 530) = 11.81, p < .0001). The null hypothesis that the
instruments are weak were rejected if the largest rejection rate of a nominal 5% Wald test we are
willing to tolerate is 15%, according to the critical value of 2SLS size of nominal 5% Wald test (11.59).
Neither the overidentification test (p > .12) nor the Hausman test (p = .73) was significant, suggesting a
possible causal effect of drug use on financial wealth.
Sensitivity analysis 2: Regressions controlling for additional individual characteristics
We ran regression models with dependent variables of mental and physical health, employment status,
income and financial wealth while controlling for additional independent variables such as self-control,
consistently significant in all models (all ps < .05), with the exception of the model for financial wealth,
which became marginally significant (β = .92, p =.084). Thus the results are robust and showed that
whether taking drugs or not can indeed predict various aspects of well-being.

5. Discussions
Based on surveys of native Dutch and immigrants in the Netherlands, we first investigated factors
related to drug use and showed that certain psychological, social, and demographic factors are reliable
predictors of people's substance use prevalence and intensity. The IV analysis shows that emotional
stability may play a causal role. Furthermore, we analysed the effect of taking drugs on individuals’
health, labour market outcomes and financial wealth. We find that substance use predicts various aspects
of mental and physical health, employment probabilities, net monthly income, and financial wealth.
Substance use seems to also have a negative causal effect on all these aspects. The findings contribute to
a better understanding of the effects of drug use on well-being. Our results have theoretical and social
implications.
First, our study shows a number of factors that contribute to the prevalence and intensity of substance
use. At the cross-cultural level, past research showed that being of non-Western ethnicity increases the
probability of last year’s cannabis use whereas being of Western ethnicity decreases the probability of
last year’s cannabis use (Wouters & Benschop, 2012). In our study we found that other Westerners had
significantly less drug use than Dutch natives, and Surinam immigrants had a higher prevalence of drug
use. This should not be interpreted as any point of discrimination but is worth our attention to better
understand certain groups to provide more targeted support. Individually, the effects of gender, age,
living location, number of children and complying with parents are consistent with previous research
(e.g., Helm et al., 2002; Kunst, & Gebhardt, 2018; Palali & van Ours, 2015; van den Bos, Blaauw &
Bieleman, 2022), but we are the first to analyse demographics, accessibility to drugs, social norm of
having a motivation to comply with parents, as well as so many relevant variables altogether in one
regression model. We did not find any effect of most personality traits or self-esteem. This could be that
the effects of certain personality traits are small or absent (Dennhardt & Murphy, 2013; Kashdan, Vetter,
& Collins, 2005), especially when a number of individual characteristics have been accounted for.
However, we did find a strong predictor of one personality trait - emotional stability, which confirms
earlier findings that neuroticism associates with drug use (Dennhardt & Murphy, 2013; Kotov et al.,
2010), and further shows a possible causal effect for the first time. Our IV analysis shows that emotional
stability is exogenous. This is not completely making no sense for two reasons. First, according to twin
studies, the Big Five personality traits have substantial heritable components, which can explain 40–
60% of the variance (emotional stability 41%) (Jang, Livesley, & Vemon, 1996). Second, biology
research shows that interactions between over 700 genes had a larger influence on certain personality
traits than cultural and environmental influences (Zwir et al., 2020). If people were born with certain
personality traits which are largely determined by genetics, then emotional stability can be exogenous.
Nevertheless, one can still argue that our instruments are too weak to avoid a type II error. For example,
there is still a possibility that substance uses may change people’s personality trait. However, controlling
for the 2016 baseline condition, emotional stability in 2016 still predicts future drug use in 2020. As
time progresses unidirectionally, drug use in 2020 cannot influence emotional stability several years
before, which suggests a possible effect direction from emotional stability to drug use. Given that
people’s personality is stable in the adulthood, our next step is to use the panel data analysis to shed
more lights on the causality.
In addition, the status of having a paid job negatively predicts the prevalence and intensity of drug use in
2016 and four years later. Nevertheless, economics studies (including this study) usually investigate this
relationship the other way round, such as drug use affects labour market success. Therefore,
employment status can be endogenous (e.g., reversed causal relationship). The result that employment
possibilities in 2016 predicts future drug use in 2020 suggests a possible effect direction going from
employment possibilities to drug use. However, in our study we can hardly find a good instrumental
variable for employment possibilities to further seek whether having a paid job causes a lower drug
prevalence. In other words, we cannot fully rule out the possibility of omitting an unobserved variable
that affects both employment and drug use. Interestingly, there has been a country-level experiment in
Portugal. In 2000, Portugal used to be one of the worst drug problems in Europe. Dr. João Goulão
initiated a massive program of job creation for drug addicts, and microloans for addicts to start small
businesses (Domoslawski & Siemaszko, 2011). Surprisingly, injecting drug use dropped by 50% within
ten years after the experiment began (Hughes & Stevens, 2010). As said in Johann Hari (2015)’s
TedTalk “the core of that message -- you're not alone, we love you -- has to be at every level of how we
respond to addicts, socially, politically and individually… the opposite of addiction is not sobriety. The
opposite of addiction is connection.” Providing a job seems to be an effective way of establishing social
connections. We urge to pay attention to the employment opportunities for drug addicts.
As for the consequences of taking drugs, previous research has inconsistent results on the effect of
substance use on health and labour market success, whereas our study aims to reduce a potential omitted
variable by controlling for a number of important individual characteristics, and showed a consistent
negative effect of substance use on general health status, BMI, diabetes, recurrent complaints, days of
diseases, depression, anxiety, upset, happiness, calmness, employment, net income and financial wealth.
In particular, results of analysing different types of instruments appear to show a causal role of
substance use on all dependent variables mentioned above. To the best of our knowledge, many findings
of this study have not been documented in the literature. For example, this is the first study showing the
consequences of substance use for financial wealth. The different types of instruments for studying the
consequences of taking drugs, which have methodological implications for future research.
However, the causal interpretations may be interpreted with caution. One will hardly believe that drug
use can be treated as exogenous, in spite of the test result. The IV test results may, after all, be due to
lack of power. It is absolutely possible that individuals’ unemployment leads to more drug use (as we
have shown), or poorer physical/ mental health requires one to use drugs (e.g., cancer patients). Thus, a
more conservative conclusion is that substance use consistently negatively relates to health, labour
market performance and financial wealth.
This preliminary study has a number of limitations. First, the data analysed are based on self-reports of
drug use, which could be underreported due to social desirability, although confidentiality is assured.
Second, our sample may be biased as we have a larger proportion of immigrants than the Dutch sample.
Third, in this small sample, we did not make a subcategory of drug types, but it would be interesting to
analyse more detailed categories such as soft and hard drugs. In addition, for factors influencing drug
use, we only showed a possible causal effect of emotional stability on drug use, but did not investigate
the causal effect of other factors such as living in extremely urban area, number of children, and
employment status. Our next step is to use panel data regressions to study multiple waves of the LISS
longitudinal data from 2015 to 2021 to further assess the relationship between social-demographic,
psychological factors and drug use. Finally, we have only investigated the effect of whether or not
taking drugs on wellbeing, and our following-up study will make use of LISS panel longitudinal data to
focus on the impact of lifetime experience and the intensity of drug use on health, labour market success
and wealth to corroborate our findings.
