Abstract
We study the effect of people’s cultural temporal focus (values of attending to past or future events)
on their health, labour market performance and happiness. Participants’ (N=1177) data were initially
collected in 2016 and then again in a follow-up study in 2020-2021. We find that habitually more
attending to the future is negatively associated with diseases (heart attack; high cholesterol; diabetes;
high-blood pressure; Covid19), but positively with health-related behaviour (eating vegetables and
fruit; less smoking), health status (e.g., healthy weight; long life expectancy), income, hourly wage,
financial satisfaction and happiness. Furthermore, such cultural temporal focus predicts participants’
future situation of these aspects of well-being in 2020-2021, even after controlling for the 2016
baseline situation, IQ, self-control, patience, risk aversion and demographic information. Given that
habitually attending to the past is likely to lead people to give less priority to the future compared to
the past, we propose a temporal values and well-being hypothesis: Temporal values have
consequences for people’s planning and behaviour, thus influencing individuals’ concurrent and
longitudinal overall well-being. Our findings have strong implications for theories of time perception,
measurements of temporal values, and for a better understanding of factors that influence people’s
health, income, and happiness.

Introduction
“Life is nothing but time” (Dasa, 2014). The concept of time is not merely an objective physic reality
but also has psychological influence on people’s cognitive processing and behaviour (e.g.,
Carstensen, 2006). The present study focuses on the latter, investigating the effect of temporal values
on people’s health, income, and happiness, concurrently and longitudinally.
People’s perception of time can influence their thinking and behaviour. Studies on the subjective
sense of time have mainly investigated people’s time perspective, which is “[t]he totality of the
individual’s views of his/her psychological future and psychological past existing at a given
[objective] time” (Lewin, 1951, p.75). The seminal work on time perspective is the Zimbardo Time
Perspective Inventory (ZTPI; Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999). It establishes a comprehensive measure of
individual differences in time perspective, considering time as multidimensional (i.e., past, present,
and future), having different affective states (e.g., past negative vs. past positive), and related to
many outcomes of interest such as well-being and achievement (see the review of Levasseur et al.,
2020). ZTPI includes 56 items, such as the extent to which an individual agrees with the statements
“Painful past experiences keep being replayed in my mind”, “Happy memories of good times spring
readily to mind”, “I complete projects on time by making steady progress”, “Taking risks keeps my
life from becoming boring” (arguably, this is a measurement of risk aversion rather than time), etc.
Researchers using this time measurement have found that individual differences in cognitive
engagement with time (mixed with risk aversion) can influence work outcomes such as well-being,
decision making, motivation, and achievement (e.g., Drake et al., 2008; Lasane & Jones, 1999;
Seijts, 1998; Shipp & Aeon, 2019; Stolarski & Matthews, 2016; Zhang & Howell, 2011; Zimbardo
& Boyd, 1999). Additionally, Shipp et al. (2009) created a Temporal Focus Scale (TFS) that tests
primarily how much people generally think about the past, present and future (e.g., “I think about
things from my past”, “I think about where I am today”, “I think about times to come”). This
measurement only has 12 items, but does not consider any cultural attitudes about time.
Unlike focusing on ZTPI (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999) or TFS (Shipp et al., 2009), another line of
research investigates time at a more global level that focuses on people’s general values toward time
(i.e., habits of attending to past or future events). For example, de la Fuente et al. (2014) state that
people from specific (sub)culture groups tend to focus more on past times and older generations, are
more observant of ancient rituals, and place more value on tradition, whereas people from other
cultures can have a greater focus on the future, valuing economic development, globalization, and
technological progress. Fuente et al. (2014) hypothesize that people who are habitually attending to
past events metaphorically tend to place the past in front of them, “in the location where they could
focus on the past literally with their eyes if past events were physical objects that could be seen” (de
la Fuente et al., 2014, p.1684). This hypothesis is originally proposed for cross-cultural comparisons,
but it has been applied to study individual differences within a given culture as well. For example,
regardless of cultures, individuals who are more attending to the future are more likely to place the
future ahead and the past behind them (Callizo-Romero et al., 2020). Interestingly, Guo et al. (2012)
found that cultural temporal focus affects how people value future and past events. For example,
Canadians put more monetary value to a future event than to an identical event in the past, but
Chinese people attach more monetary value to an event in the past than to an identical event in the
future.
In the context of a completely different theoretical framework, the economist M. Keith Chen claims
that how people talk about time influences their economic behaviour (Chen, 2013). He assumes that
the grammar of temporal language affects people’s perception of temporal distance, which in turn
can affect the value of future rewards (linguistic-saving hypothesis). This hypothesis predicts that
individuals speak languages that grammatically separate future and now, giving speakers the
impression that the future is far away (e.g., “It is raining now” vs. “It WILL rain tomorrow.”) and
making them less aware of the future consequences of their current behaviour. It implies that they are
less willing to sacrifice the present pleasure for the future (such as planning less for the retirement,
having less savings, poorer health, etc.)
All these studies on time perspective, temporal focus scale and economic behaviour or linguistic-
saving theory have raised at least four important issues. First, most studies pursue a better
understanding of correlations between time perspective and outcomes. They typically do not control
for participants’ other characteristics that may relate to the outcomes, or sometimes mix risk aversion
with time perspective, so that time perspective could operate as a moderator (e.g., Shipp et al., 2009).
Second, it is still unclear whether temporal focus mirrors thinking about a specific time (e.g., past,
present, or future) or whether all time periods matter (Levasseur et al., 2020), resulting in different
balances between past and future attention. Third, for the linguistic-saving hypothesis, Chen did not
test any link between temporal language and perception of temporal distance. In particular, recent
research shows that there is no effect of linguistic grammar of future time references on the
perceived distance of future events (Jäggi et al., 2022), and several studies, including a re-analysis of
Chen’s original data set ( see Roberts, Winters, & Chen, 2015) as well as lab experiments, failed to
replicate Chen’s (2013) hypothesis (Chen, He & Riyanto, 2019; Thoma & Tytus, 2017). In addition,
although there are studies showing that time perspective and temporal focus scale correlate to future-
oriented planning or behaviour, few studies have investigated the influence of general temporal
values on such aspects (Callizo-Romero et al., 2022). The study of the effect of cultural temporal
focus on monetary values by Guo et al. (2012) in fact did not test participants’ temporal focus.
In the current study we aim to propose an alternative theory of time perception and wellbeing. We
investigated the impact of general temporal values on several measures of well-being: people’s
health, financial situation (i.e., gross net income, hourly wages) and happiness. The general values of
time (habitual attentional focus on the past or the future), surprisingly, have hardly been studied
outside the context of a temporal diagram task in which participants label the past and future events
in front of and behind a character (e.g. Callizo-Romero et al., 2020; Gu, Zheng, & Swerts, 2019).
According to the temporal-focus hypothesis (de la Fuente et al., 2014), if people put important things
in front of them and leave less important things behind, habitually attending to the past is likely to
lead people to give less priority to the future than the past. Thus temporal values have consequences
for individuals’ planning and behaviour, which can in turn influence their overall well-being in the
long term. We call this hypothesis the temporal-values and well-being hypothesis.
In our study, to reduce the potential problem of confounding factors due to unobserved
characteristics, we additionally measure a number of important factors such as participants’ IQ, risk
aversion, patience, self-control and income, most of which are rarely controlled for in existing
studies. Furthermore, outcomes such as health and disease can be significantly influenced by
genetics. Therefore, we have first obtained data of participants’ health, disease, income and
happiness as a baseline control in 2016, and gathered such information of the same participants again
in 2020-2021. We thus use participants’ attitudes toward time in 2016 to predict their future well-
being, while controlling for their well-being in 2016. This helps to better understand possible causal
relations between temporal focus and dependent variables, given the fact that time progresses
unidirectionally such that future health, disease, labour market participation and happiness cannot
influence people’s general temporal values four or five years back. The results of our study not only
have theoretical implications for cognitive processing of time, but also provide a better
understanding of factors that may influence people’s health, disease, income, and happiness.
Data
We use survey data for the Netherlands in 2016, 2020 and 2021. We have designed a special
questionnaire with a set of questions including attitudes toward time (temporal focus questionnaire,
de la Fuente et al., 2014, shortened version, e.g., future-focused item: “It is important to innovate and
adapt to the new changes.” Past-focused item: “The traditional way of living is better than the
modern way.”, IQ (Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices Test, Raven, 1976; shortened version,
Bilker et al., 2012), self-control, risk aversion (van Rooij et al., 2011), time preference (patience),
financial future time perspective, demographic information, etc (see a full list of these measures in
Appendix 1).
The questionnaire was administered in Dutch to 1471 participants in the Longitudinal Internet
Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS), managed by Centerdata (Tilburg University, The
Netherlands) in 2016. There were 1177 respondents (M =46.69, range 25-66, SD=11.89, 646
age
females, 531 males), including 659 participants with some immigrant background (361 first-
generation and 298 second-generation immigrants; immigrants were oversampled, in the sense that
all first and second generation immigrants in the LISS panel were invited to participate, plus a
random subsample of LISS panel participants without an immigration background).
We obtained participants’ background such as employment status and demographic information. We
also obtained information about participants’ health (Questions 1-12), financial satisfaction,
happiness (Q13-15), labour market performance (monthly gross net income, employment, and
weekly hours of paid work) and financial wealth (the gross amount of financial assets) in the same
year 2016. Moreover, participants who originally took the survey in 2016 were traced in 2020 to
obtain their health, disease, happiness, and financial wealth, and in 2021 to obtain their labour
market performance. We additionally obtained information about whether participants got Covid19
in 2020 and 2021 and whether they smoked in 2016 and 2021 (gathered from waves 9, 13 and 14 of
the longitudinal study of Health in the LISS panel).
Questions related to health and happiness
Q1. Do you eat raw/cooked vegetables? (1=never, 6=every day)
Q2. Do you eat fruit? (1=never, 6=every day)
Q3. Do you smoke now: Yes (1) or No (0)
Q4. How would you describe your health, generally speaking? (1 poor; 2 moderate; 3 good; 4 very
good; 5 excellent)
Q5. Did you have contact with a medical specialist over the past 12 months? (0 no; 1 yes)
Q6. Has a physician told you this last year that you suffer from one of the following
diseases/problems? (1-angina, 2-a heart attack/heart failure, 3-high blood pressure/ hypertension, 4-
high cholesterol, 5-diabetes/too high blood sugar level, 6-cancer, 7-a gastric/duodenal/peptic ulcer)
(0 no; 1 yes)
Q7. I do not take any medicine: yes (1), no (0)
Q8. How tall are you? How much do you weigh, without clothes and shoes?
Q9. Ten questions about a number of actions (e.g., moving) that some people have difficulties
with. (1 without any trouble, 5 cannot perform it at all)
Q10. Thirteen questions about self-help ability (e.g., dressing) that some people have difficulties
with. (1 without any trouble, 5 cannot perform it at all)
Q11. How would you rate your chance of living to be 80 years old or older? (0 no chance at all, 10
absolutely certain)
Q12. Has a physician told you this last year that you suffer from COVID-19 (new corona virus)?
Q13. How satisfied are you with your financial situation? (0=not at all satisfied, 10=entirely
satisfied)
Q14. Can you indicate, on a scale from 0 to 10, to what degree you consider yourself happy? (0
means that you are not at all happy, and 10 means that you are extremely happy.)
Q15. How do you feel over the past month? I felt happy: (1=never, 6=continuously)
Due to participants’ unwillingness to provide some information or dropping out of the survey
between 2016 and 2020, the sample size that can be used for our analysis is between 777 to 541
participants depending on the question (e.g., the sample size of financial wealth is smaller than
others). Furthermore, in 2021, we have obtained net income information of 810, paid work status of
730 and weekly working hours of 382 participants. We do not have the latest data for other aspects
of 2021. Participants were paid every time answering questions. We oversampled immigrants but the
sample is generally not affected by selectivity bias due to nonresponse, as those who failed or
refused to provide income and financial information in 2016 generally do not differ in their average
age, education, IQ, marriage, self-control, patience, temporal values, etc. (all p’s>.1); the only
exception here is that females are less willing to reveal their financial wealth than males are.
Dependent variables
Health
We used Q1-12 to study the correlation between general temporal values and health, chronic diseases
and life expectancy. We first generated two dependent variables on whether people eat vegetables
and fruits, which were only available for the year 2016: eatveg and eatfruit (Q1-2). As for smoking
(Q3), we generated two dependent variables smokenow16 and smokenow21. Then we generated 7
dependent variables (Q4-11) on participants’ self-assessed health (health): whether seeing a
specialist (no_specialist = 1 if the respondent did not contact a specialist, 0 otherwise), having a
chronic disease (no_disease = 1 if the respondent did not have any of the diseases in Q6, 0
otherwise), taking medication (no_medicine = 1 if no medication was taken (Q7)), having a healthy
weight (healthy_BMI: Body Mass Index between BMI between 18.5 and 25; cf. WHO, 2005), the
degree of difficulty in physical movement (move_difficulty) and self-care ability (life_ability),
computed as the means of their question lists, and life expectancy (live80+). These variables are all
labelled with the corresponding year of measurement, 2016 or 2020 (e.g., health16; health20;
disease16; disease20; healthy_BMI16; healthy_BMI20, etc). For the analysis of Covid19 (Q12), we
generated a binary dummy covidbin, where those who got the coronavirus either in 2020 or 2021 was
coded as 1.
Income and hourly wages
We generated two dependent variables for participants’ monthly individual net income and net
hourly wages in 2016 and 2021, which are log-transformed (logincome16, logincome21,
loghourwages16 and loghourwages21). We computed the hourly wages by dividing monthly gross
net income by four times the number of working hours per week. As in the LISS panel a 0 (zero)
doesn’t necessarily mean a person has no income and many Dutch person in the Netherlands can get
some income due to the social security system, those who reported 0 income (N=115) are excluded
in the analysis of income.
Financial satisfaction and happiness
We used Q13-15 to generate three dependent variables on participants’ financial satisfaction
(FinancialSatisfaction), overall happiness (generalhappy) and recent happiness (recenthappy) in
It is noted in the LISS panel that: “Since some people prefer not to make their income information available to
CentERdata, a 0 (zero) can mean two different things: (1) that there is no income at all, or (2) that a panel member does
not know what the income is or does not want to make that information available to us. In the second case, panel
members ought to indicate that they do not know what the income is. Unfortunately, not all panel members do so, so that
there are and continue to be panel members that enter (0) while they actually do have an income. It is impossible to
determine who these panel members are, however.” (codebook_BackgroundVariables_EN_9.3, p.8/13; Retrieved April
2016 and 2020.
Independent variables
For our key variable on temporal values, participants rated the extent to which they agreed on the
four statements at a scale of 1-9, where 1=completely disagree and 9= totally agree. Based on scores
testing future-focused attitude and past-focused attitude, we generated a Temporal-focus Index (TFI)
for each participant: TFI=(mean of future-focused score−mean of past-focused score)/(mean of
future-focused score+mean of past-focused score) (de la Fuente et al., 2014). TFI ranges from −1 to
1, where −1 represents past-focused, 0 represents present-focused and 1 represents future-focused.
Additionally, we generated the following independent variables: IQ, risk aversion, patience (time
preference), self-control, education (high; low), logincome (log-transformed income), financial
future time perspective and log-transformed financial assets (logfinassets). Moreover, we controlled
for demographic information such as gender, age, marriage, number of children and whether a
participant is an immigrant or not, etc. Sample statistics of the main variables are presented in
Appendix 2. For a complementary description of the variables, see also Appendix 1.
Results
We used different regression models to study the effect of TFI on health, income, and happiness,
with all related dependent variables in the concurrent year 2016. Furthermore, we examined whether
TFI can predict these dependent variables in the future (e.g., health20; happydegree20;
logincome21), controlling for their current value or not. Additionally, we did two sensitivity
analyses: (1) using a GAM model (Wood, 2017) to examine possible non-linear effects of TFI or
age, and (2) analysing the effect of TFI without including age as TFI and age are correlated.
Health, chronic disease and life expectancy

less likely to smoke, either in 2016 (β=-.78, p=.003) or in 2021 (β=-1.5, p<.001). Interestingly, when
the participant’s baseline smoking behaviour in 2016 is also controlled for, TFI can still predict
analysis only on those who smoked in 2016, TFI still significantly predicts their quitting of smoking
in 2021 (β=-1.64, p=.033). On average, an increase of 1 unit of TFI predicts a reduction of 0.2
(2016), 0.32 (2021) and 0.11 (2021_ctrl16) percentage points in the likelihood to smoke, and predicts
0.53 percentage points increase in the likelihood to quit smoking in the next five years for those
whose smoked in 2016.

even after controlling for the 2016 health situation as a baseline (β=.51, p=.034). As for the
prediction of chronic disease, participants with a smaller TFI are significantly more likely to get

predicts the possibility of taking any medicine (Q7, AME=0.20, p=.003, see some examples of
In addition, participants’ TFI is negatively associated with difficulty in physical movements (Q9, β=-

can still predict these two aspects for 2020 after controlling for the 2016 condition and other factors.

who are more future focused have significantly less difficulty in psychical movement (β=-.24,

Finally, TFI has a significant positive correlation with people’s self-perceived life expectancy both in
2016 (Q11, β=.51, p=.002) and four years later (β=.59, p=.001). The effect of TFI in predicting life
expectancy in 2020 is persistent (β=.45, p=.035) even after controlling for significant factors
including the 2016 baseline. This indicates that habitually attending less to the past but more to the
future increases the chances that self-perceived life expectancy exceeds 80 years. Interestingly, TFI
even significantly predicts whether participants would get the Covid19 in 2020 or 2021 (β=-1.28,

Income and hourly wages
As shown in Table3, temporal focus is significantly associated with participants’ concurrent income
in 2016 (β=0.34, p<.001) and five years later in 2021 (β=0.44, p<.001), while controlling for
education, gender, and IQ. Given that males and females often have different labour market
performance in the Netherlands (Yao & van Ours, 2015), we added an interaction term between
gender and TFI. The result shows that there is a significant interaction between TFI and gender,
suggesting that the effect is more pronounced for females (β =0.52, p <.001; β =0.75, p <.001)
16 16 20 20
than for males (β =0.16, p =.18; β =0.20, p =.139). Interestingly, even when income in 2016 is

additionally controlled for, a larger TFI indeed still predicts a higher income five years later (β=0.13,
hourly wages (β=0.07, p=.42), but when TFI is split into past and future focus values, the future
focus is significant (β=0.23, p=.049). Furthermore, TFI predicts hourly wages five years later in 2021
(β=0.36, p=.01), controlling for education (p<.001), IQ (p=.056), age (p=.004), gender (p<.001) and
other variables. Importantly, after additionally controlling for hourly wages in 2016 (p<.001) for the
prediction of 2021, most factors become insignificant except education (β=0.15, p=.003), gender
(β=0.24, p<.001) and TFI (β=0.24, p=.07). This shows that everything else being equal, including
the hourly wage in 2016, participants who have a higher TFI in 2016 have a higher hourly wage five

Sensitivity analyses
It could be that TFI and age may have a non-linear relationship with the dependent variables, so we
built a GAM model (Wood, 2017) by fitting the data of TFI and age each with a smoothed (non-
linear) term. Age usually has a negative association with TFI (de la Fuente et al., 2014), but when
age and TFI both positively affect the dependent variables, it is more justified to include age in the
model when examining the effect of TFI to avoid this potential omitted variable. This is also
reflected in the goodness of fit of the model, as the adjusted R decreased when age (a significant
TFI are robust, regardless of whether including age in the model. Furthermore, TFI is not a proxy of
age, as when TFI is dropped in the model, age itself is not significant in many predictions. In
except smoking21_ctrl16, diseases and females’ income and hourly wage. It seems that the TFI value
of -0.25 is an important threshold for health and income. After this threshold, changes become less
pronounced and sometimes level out (e.g., female’s income and hourly age).

Discussion
In this study we analyse the relationship between people’s general attitudes toward time and their
health, income, and happiness. First for health, we find that people’s TFI correlates with their
frequency of eating fruit and vegetables, as well as smoking behaviour in 2016. TFI also predicts
whether a person is a smoker 5 years later even after controlling for the baseline smoking situation in
2016. Furthermore, keeping all other explanatory variables constant, people who are habitually more
attending to the future, are less likely to have chronic diseases (e.g., heart attack, diabetes) or
Covid19, less often take medicines, and are less likely to see a specialist. They also have less
difficulty in physical movement, better self-care ability, and expect to live longer than those who are
more attending to the past. One may argue that people’s health status may reversely influence their
temporal focus (e.g., worse in health leads to more past-focused). This is possible for momentary
temporal focus when people have some extreme change in health status (Skipp, 2020). However,
such reverse causality is less likely in our study because: (1) our study investigates people’s general
temporal focus (people’s values toward time), which is relatively stable during most of one’s adult
life (Aspinwall, 2005). It is implausible that healthy behaviour such as eating fruit and vegetables
and quitting smoking would reversely make people less attending to the past. (2) We have used each
participant’s 2016 health status and diseases as baseline controls and studied the changes in health
status and diseases in 2020 referencing 2016. It is impossible that suffering from certain diseases,
getting Covid19 or taking medicines can cause participants to be more past-focused four years
earlier. Thus participants’ overall temporal values can indeed predict their future health.
As for income and hourly wages, consistent with past research (e.g., Blau & Kahn, 2017; Zagorsky,
2007), we find that there is an income and wage gap between females and males, and that IQ and
education positively predict future income and hourly wages. However, the innovative finding in our
study is that temporal focus associates with an individual’s (especially for females’) income and
hourly wage concurrently and in the future. Compared to people who are habitually more future-
focused, those who are more past-focused are less likely to have higher income and hourly wages
five years later, keeping other factors constant. This shows that habits of attending to the past or
future can have a long-term relationship with an individual’s income and hourly wages. Interestingly,
we also find that TFI even predicts people’s homeownership, savings and financial assets four or six
years in the future in another study (Zheng, Gu, & van Soest, 2023). These results combined suggest
that people’s temporal values help substantially to make a long-term prediction for their financial
well-being.
Furthermore, we show that temporal values are associated with people’s financial satisfaction and
happiness concurrently and in the future. Previous studies have mostly used the Zimbardo Time
Perspective Inventory (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999) and find that a future time perspective did not
correlate with subjective happiness or life satisfaction (Drake et al., 2008), but happiness is more
associated with the relative importance and emotional valence people assign to their past, present,
and future (Zhang, Howell, & Stolarski, 2013). Different from their time perspective measurement,
in our study we use the shortened temporal focus questionnaire and show a significant correlation
between people’s TFI and their concurrent and future happiness. Our results are informative because:
First, instead of studying one specific time independently (e.g., past OR future), we have used the
TFI that reflects a continuum between past, present and future temporal values. Second, we have
controlled for important factors of participants’ health, financial wealth, income, gender, marriage,
and number of children, IQ, self-control, patience, education, etc.. No previous studies investigating
the perception of time and happiness have considered all these factors, even though people who are
more patient, better in self-controlling and higher in IQ are significantly happier as shown from our
results. Third, unlike most research only investigating a concurrent correlation, we have done a
longitudinal study showing that temporal values predict people’s future financial satisfaction and
happiness.
In short, our study shows that, regardless of native Dutch or immigrants, people’s habits of attending
to the past or future are not only associated with their current health-related behaviour, diseases, life
expectancy, income and happiness, but also predict their future situation. Such results support our
temporal values and well-being hypothesis, proposing that individuals’ temporal values can affect
their attentional priority of the future and past which further influences their behaviour and future
well-being. Given that individuals who are habitually attending to past events may metaphorically
tend to place the past in front of them, in the place where they could focus on the past as if past
events were physical objects that could be seen (de la Fuente et al., 2014; Callizo-Romero et al.,
2020), and given that people usually put important things in front of them and leave less important
things behind, habitually focusing on the past is likely to lead people to give less priority to the
future compared to the past. Therefore, temporal values can have consequences for their planning
and behaviour, influencing overall well-being in the long term.
Our study has a number of contributions. Theoretically, our hypothesis is novel. It is different from
Chen’s (2013) linguistic-saving hypothesis as we are not testing the effects of structures of temporal
language on economic behaviour but directly testing the effects of time values on wellbeing.
Furthermore, our results go beyond Guo et al.’s (2012) finding that cultural temporal focus affects
how people value future and past events, but reveal that general cultural temporal values (different
from individual momentary temporal focus) can predict various aspects of wellbeing.
Methodologically, our study shows predictive power of a shortened version of temporal focus testing
items with more than two dozen dependent variables ranging from economic behaviour, health and
disease, to happiness, smoking and diet. These four items can be used in future studies on well-being.
Furthermore, there are several practical implications. First, given that a low TFI predicts less
desirable wellbeing in a few years (if no prevention is taken), the government, family doctors and aid
One alternative interpretation of TFI is that it measures those who are more conservative verses more innovative and
progressive. However, previous research shows that conservative people experience higher degree of happiness (Burton,
Plaks & Peterson, 2015; Schlenker, Chambers, & Le, 2011). Additionally, conservatives also tend to be healthier than
liberals and are less likely to smoke and take more exercising, etc. (Chan, 2019; Subramanian & Perkins, 2010). This is
reversed to our findings that a lower TFI (more past-focused) relates to less healthy and less happy. Given the four items
represent 80% of the original temporal focus questionnaire (21 items see
SupMat2.pdf ), they are more likely to measure people’s values towards time.
units should treat those who have a negative TFI as a potential vulnerable group. Those people
should be alerted to take more preventive actions in planning their life and work, and have more
adaptive behaviour to health and diets. In addition, TFI predicts females’ net monthly income and
hourly wage. Targeting females who have a lower TFI may not only help them improve their labour
market performance but also reduce gender wage gap and improve gender equality in the future.
Our results may also have some potential psychotherapy and clinical implications. For example, a
popular treatment for depression is to encourage patients to adopt a more present-focused temporal
thinking (Shapiro et al., 2006). Given our results show that past-focused people are less happy, it is
intriguing to think whether psychedelics can induce a mental state that is less focused on the past and
therefore less unhappy (Speth et al., 2016). If so, such psychedelics may be a useful medicine.
Likewise, it is exciting to examine whether nutritionist and doctors can promote their
customers/patients to have more future-focused thinking and therefore eat more often vegetables and
fruit but smoke less.
In addition, given that TFI is affected by cultural environment but is quite stable over most of the
whole adulthood (Aspinwall, 2005), it is important to penetrate the optimal temporal thought into
elementary and junior education. Providing a better environment that can form a more future-focused
and less past-focused temporal values cannot only improve national quality in terms of planning but
may also have an important influence on people’s overall well-being in the short and long run.
Finally, although our study aims to better understand a possible causal effect of temporal values by
controlling for more individual characteristics and using longitudinal predictions, one can still argue
that there can be an omitted variable that influences both an individual’s TFI and all the dependent
variables. If TFI is not causing but rather reflecting deep differences that drive the overall wellbeing,
then TFI acts as a powerful marker of such an omitted variable. Because TFI predicts more than a
dozen of dependent variables in different fields even after controlling for well-known factors such as
IQ, education, financial literacy and SES, we believe it deserves attention from researchers.
