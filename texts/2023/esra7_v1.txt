Abstract: Colleges are under increasing pressure to develop future citizens who are interested
in—and capable of—creating positive social change and improving their communities. Using
data from the multi-institutional SERU survey, this study suggests college students’ participation
in leadership positions can promote their engagement in greater social change.
In the prevailing climate of transparency and accountability, colleges and universities are placing
greater importance upon demonstrating students’ development in key areas, including diversity
awareness, institutional learning outcomes, and leadership abilities (Dugan, 2006; Roberts,
1997). Further, there is a national call to develop college students as future citizens who are
interested in—and capable of—creating positive social change and improving their communities
(The National Task Force on Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement, 2012). While
leadership development in particular has been a longstanding outcome of higher education
institutions (Astin & Astin, 2000), many institutions have traditionally overlooked some of the
extended benefits of leadership participation and development (Cress, Astin, Zimmerman-Oster,
& Burkhardt, 2001).
Contemporary perspectives on student leadership view leaders as social change agents
(Astin & Astin, 2000). Following this perspective, in this study we examined the association
between undergraduates’ participation in student organization leadership positions and their
engagement in social change. Grounded in the social change model of leadership development,
the research questions framing this study are as follows: Is students’ participation in leadership
positions associated with their engagement in social change? Is leadership in particular types of
student clubs or organizations associated with students’ engagement in social change?
Previous studies using the social change model of leadership development framework have
relied upon data from the Multi-institutional Study of Leadership survey (Dugan, 2006, 2008;
Dugan & Komives, 2010) and the Socially Responsible Leadership scale (Tyree, 1998). In this
study, we provide new perspectives by incorporating alternative measurements of social change
and analyzing data from the multi-institutional Student Experience in the Research University
(SERU) survey. Social change measures used in this study include the frequency with which
students reflect upon their personal and social responsibility, suggest solutions for social
problems, discuss community solutions, and act upon community and social issues outside of the
classroom. Holistically, we referred to these activities as “engagement in social change” because
they reflect the complexities and nuances involved in facilitating social change for the benefit of
communities and society. This line of inquiry presents new evidence for the benefits of students’
participation in leadership positions in student organizations—benefits that extend beyond
students’ immediate college experiences to the promotion of greater social change.
Civic Responsibility, Leadership, and Social Change
Some of the earliest colleges and universities were created to educate citizens for civic and
religious leadership (Hartley & Harkavy, 2011). These public service missions, in part, still
support the framework of higher education today (Colby, Beaumont, Ehrlich, & Corngold, 2007).
The public is increasingly holding higher education accountable to instill values of civic
responsibility and social change in students. According to Jacoby (2009), “higher education
experts and critics, government and business leaders, civil society, and the public are more loudly
and more frequently calling on colleges and universities to focus sharply on educating students
for democratic empowerment and global citizenship” (p. x). Recent critical self-reflection has led
many in the academy to call for a renewal of civic engagement at the heart of higher education’s
mission and purpose. Several key publications have also emerged that signaled a call for change;
among them was the federal report A Crucible Moment: Civic Learning and Democracy’s Future
(The National Task Force on Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement, 2012).
Many scholars have suggested that the key to increasing civic engagement among college
students is to offer experiences that are deliberate, engaging, and developmentally appropriate
(Knefelkamp, 2008). Among those experiences, some scholars have found a connection between
leadership development and civic involvement (Cress et al., 2001; Dugan, 2006). For example,
Cress, Astin, Zimmerman-Oster, and Burkhardt (2001) discovered students who participated in
leadership opportunities indicated significant growth in four key areas: leadership understanding
and commitment, civic responsibility, multicultural awareness and community orientation, and
leadership skills. Research also has indicated that students involved in leadership activities have
higher levels of educational attainment and increases in personal values related to social change
(e.g., desire to promote racial understanding) than do students who do not participate in these
activities (Astin, 1993; Dugan, 2006).
Yet, amid the growing body of evidence connecting college student leadership and students’
development of civic responsibility, prior studies have not investigated whether the frequency of
students’ participation in leadership positions has any relationship with their development.
Further, prior studies have not examined whether leadership in different types of student clubs or
organizations is associated with students’ engagement in social change. In our study, we
investigated the connections between students’ involvement in leadership activities, their
understanding of personal and social responsibility, and their engagement in promoting social
change.
Conceptual Framework
The social change model of leadership development serves as our primary framework for
analyzing student development toward engaging in social change (Astin & Astin, 1996). This
framework is widely used in research and practice of student leadership development (Dugan,
2006; Dugan & Komives, 2010; Komives & Wagner, 2012). The tenets of the model suggest that
leadership is a developmental, collaborative process leading ultimately toward civic engagement
and social change (Komives & Wagner, 2012). At the core of this model are several key beliefs
that differ from normative conceptions of leadership. The model articulates leadership as
collaborative, rather than a hierarchical or individual process (Astin & Astin, 1996); furthermore,
this model views leadership as a process. Finally, the model suggests that leadership should be
based on values, rather than being a “value-neutral process involving positional ‘leaders’ and
‘followers’” (1996, p. 10).
Along those considerations, the social change model espouses seven core values
corresponding to three categories: personal, group, and community (Astin, 1996). The personal
values include consciousness of self, congruence, and commitment; three group values include
collaboration, common purpose, and controversy with civility; and the final value in the
community category is known as citizenship. The social change model argues that students
develop the attitude and ability to affect positive social change by growth in the seven core
leadership values. Students participating in leadership roles on campus that enact or develop
these core values (explicitly or implicitly) will, according to this model, be more prepared to
enact leadership for social change. Although any type of leadership role could theoretically
develop these values, participation in certain types of organizations (e.g., student government or
advocacy organizations) may be more effective at developing leadership values and engagement
in social change.
Through their leadership involvement in organizations, student leaders develop social
networks with other students, may become more involved in campus politics or related matters,
and are likely more “tuned in” to campus life. They are also likely to experience situations that
increase their development of the seven core leadership values supported in the social change
model. For example, student leaders often develop a sense of strong commitment to the
organizations in which they are involved. In connecting with the campus community, student
leaders develop greater social networks. Further, student leaders encounter developmental tasks
and challenges that are more likely to foster a sense of obligation for participation in community
and social change.
Methods
Instrument
The SERU survey is based at the Center for Studies of Higher Education at the University of
California, Berkeley. The SERU survey sampling plan is a census scan of the undergraduate
experience. In the SERU survey, each student answers a set of core questions that focus on time
use, evaluation of a student’s major, campus climate, and satisfaction. Each student is also
randomly assigned one of four modules based upon a research theme. The themes are academic
engagement, community and civic engagement, global knowledge and skills, and student life and
development.
Participants
The survey was administered to 213,160 undergraduate students across nine large, public
universities classified by the Carnegie Foundation as having very high research activity. These
institutions are located across the United States, with one in the Midwest, three on the West
Coast, two in the Northeast, and three in the Southern/Southeastern part of the United States. The
institutional level completion response rate for the SERU survey was 38.1% (n = 81,135). The
majority of items used in this analysis were embedded in a community and civic engagement
module of the SERU survey that was randomly assigned to 20% of students, from which we only
used nontransfer students for our analysis (n = 13,971). Within our sample, 59.3% were female
(n = 8,285), .4% American Indian or Alaskan Native (n = 59), 5.4% Black (n = 756), 11.4%
Hispanic (n = 1,590), 16.8% Asian (n = 2,340), 58.3% White (n = 8,151), 4.6% other/unknown
(n = 634), and 3.2% international (n = 441).
Measures
Leadership participation. Students were asked to indicate the ways in which they had been
involved in 13 different activities or organizations. For each organization, students could select
“participant or member,” “officer or leader,” or “neither.” The number of students who responded
positions in Greek fraternities or sororities (8%), academic clubs (6.6%), and service-related
organizations (5.6%). For our first analysis, we dummy-coded students’ positional leadership as a
leader of at least one organization (0 = nonparticipant or participant of an organization; 1 =
officer or leader or an organization). For the second, we dummy-coded the leadership variables
so that participation/nonparticipation were referent categories to the focal leadership category. In
dummy-coding leadership, we discovered that 35.6% (n = 4,998) of students had served in a
leadership position at least once.
Demographics. Several research studies have suggested college students’ values,
background characteristics, and college experiences impact their propensity to be civically
engaged (Misa, Anderson, & Yamamura, 2005); therefore, we included these measures as
controls in our analyses. Gender was dummy-coded with males as the referent category, and
racial and ethnic groups were dummy-coded with White and other students as referent categories.
In this study, we defined first-generation students as those whose parents have not earned a
baccalaureate degree, and we dummy-coded the variable with nonfirst-generation students the
referent category. Further, international students were also dummy-coded with all other students
serving as the referent category. Because we used all academic levels of undergraduates in this
analysis, we also controlled for students’ age (M = 20.27, SD = 2.12).
College experience. With the understanding that some students may not enter into leadership
positions until later in their academic career, we controlled for the number of credits students had
earned (M = 74.68, SD = 41.44) and their cumulative grade point average at the time of the
survey administration (M = 3.27, SD = .53). Finally, we considered the impact that students’ in-
class experiences associated with social change (including the frequency with which they had
been asked to reflect on community or social issues, act on community or social issues, define an
issue or challenge and identify possible solutions, etc.) would have on their engagement in social
change outside of class. We examined ten survey items that asked students “in the classroom,

Academic majors. Students’ academic majors were provided by individual institutions.
Majors were grouped into several main categories: science, technology, and mathematics (e.g.,
biology, aeronautics), arts and humanities (e.g., English, theater, foreign languages), social
sciences (e.g., psychology, sociology, political science), business (e.g., marketing, accounting),
undeclared, medical (e.g., nursing, nutrition, kinesiology), and education. The majors were each
dummy coded with undeclared and other majors as referent indicators.
Social change. In the survey, students were asked “outside of the classroom, how often do
you…” and responded on a frequency scale of one (never) to six (very often). Seven of the items
item strings). This measure incorporates several facets of engagement in social change, including
discussion, definition, reflection, implementation, and action.
Social change antecedents. We also controlled for students’ interest in developing their
leadership skills and connecting academic work with community work while in college. In the
survey, students were asked to rate their agreement with the following statements: “opportunities
to develop my leadership skills while here are important to me” and “opportunities to connect my
academic work with community-based experience are important to me.” Both items were scaled
one to six (strongly disagree to strongly agree).
Furthermore, we measured students’ self-reported current comfort and ability working with
people from other cultures, in addition to the frequency with which they acknowledged personal
differences, appreciated the work from someone else’s perspective, and interacted with someone
whose views were different from their own. We labeled these constructs “diversity recognition”
and “diversity skills,” as they captured both students’ ability to recognize and appreciate
differences and their comfort and ability working with others from diverse backgrounds.
Data Analysis
To develop our dependent and independent measures, we conducted a factor analysis on 24 items
with oblique rotation (promax). Given the large sample size, Kaiser’s criteria components, and
the convergence of a scree plot that showed inflexions that justified retaining six components,
the final analysis retained the following factors: classroom activism, social change, diversity
matrix, with factor loadings over .40 in bold. Each component had a high reliability, with
Cronbach’s α > .84. The factor scores were computed using the regression method and saved as
standardized scores with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The range of the items
is as follows: classroom activism (-2.80, 4.95), social change (-3.12, 5.67), diversity recognition
(-3.68, 6.46), and diversity skills (-5.20, 6.75).
We used ordinary least squares regression predicting students’ engagement in social action.
In all of our regressions, we examined assumptions of multicollinearity, homoscedasticity,
linearity, and independent/normal errors. We found that multicollinearity assumptions were not
violated. In testing homoscedasticity, we found random scatter and variability in scatterplots of
standardized residuals against the standardized predicted values. In producing histograms of
standardized residuals and normal probability plots comparing the distribution of standardized
residuals to a normal distribution, we found evidence for normality. Examinations of matrix
scatterplots suggested the relationships between the predictor and outcome variables were
relatively linear. We found consistently that the residual errors were independent across our
models (the Durbin-Watson values were 1.98 for model one and 1.94 for model two).
Results
Our first model predicting students’ engagement in social change was significant (F(22, 11,128)
= 363.74, p < .001). This model predicted 41.8% of students’ engagement in social change
controlling for demographic characteristics, college experiences, and antecedents. The model
suggested that students who participated at least once in a leadership position within a student
organization had a .13 increase in engagement in social change compared to students who were
Our second model considered the impact of leadership in specific organizations on students’
engagement in social change. This model was significant (F(34, 11,120) = 238.60, p < .001) and
predicted 42.2% of students’ engagement in social change. Leadership in five types of student
organizations and activities—advocacy groups, Greek fraternities or sororities, political
organizations, religious organizations, and community service organizations—was positively
3). We also discovered students who had served as leaders in recreational groups had
significantly less engagement in social change.

Discussion and Recommendations
Overall, the results suggest that participation in leadership positions is positively associated with
the frequency in which students engage in social change by reflecting on community/social
issues as a shared or individual responsibility; discussing and navigating controversial issues;
defining an issue or challenge and identifying possible solutions; implementing a solution to an
issue or challenge; and acting on community or social issues. Further, students who had served as
leaders within specific student organizations - advocacy groups, Greek fraternities or sororities,
political groups, religious groups, and service groups - also reported greater engagement in social
change, on average, than their peers. This finding suggests that participation in those specific
groups that are centered on foundations of community service, civic engagement, religious
values, community engagement, and social justice fosters students’ engagement in social change.
Interestingly, students who were leaders within recreational groups (e.g., chess clubs, bike
clubs) had lower engagement in social change. Leadership within the other groups in our study,
including academic groups, campus sports and varsity teams, academic and honor societies, and
media and performing groups, was not associated with students’ engagement in social change.
These areas present potential opportunities for student affairs practitioners - including student
organization advisors, student leadership coordinators, and others - to explore ways in which
they can include practices to foster students’ engagement in social change. Practitioners can
promote participation and leadership in the specific types of organizations that have been shown
to have a positive impact on engagement in social change and also work to infuse similar values
and practices into other student organizations to promote their effectiveness. By recognizing that
certain types of student organizations may have a greater impact on the development of civic
responsibility, practitioners can seek to apply similar models to all types of organizations.
Students who participate in any student organization can work to identify community and social
problems and seek ways to effect positive change in their communities.
Faculty, advisers, and student affairs professionals can also work to increase student
engagement in social change in a number of ways. Student affairs professionals can encourage
university professionals of all types to participate in student organizations to model leadership
skills. Finally, student affairs professionals can also strive to be more purposeful in helping
students to sort through the myriad opportunities on campus to find the “best fit” for each
individual. In order for practitioners to help students find meaningful ways to interact in the
context of social change and leadership, they need to take into consideration which students
become involved and why they participate. Future research is needed to get to the crux of “why”
students become involved (e.g., internal motivation, incentives, etc.), as well as what specific
characteristics and activities may be common to advocacy groups, Greek fraternities or
sororities, political groups, religious groups, and service groups that make them more effective at
promoting engagement in social change.
While some responsibility for encouraging social change inevitably falls upon students’
interest in - and commitment to - becoming civically engaged, institutions of higher education
have a significant role to play in fostering an environment that promotes civic responsibility. The
National Task Force on Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement (2012) called this a “civic
ethos,” which infuses civic values into the everyday practices and culture of an institution (p.
15). Echoing this perspective, Astin and Astin (2000) noted that,
If the next generation of citizen leaders is to be engaged and committed to leading for the
common good, then the institutions which nurture them must be engaged in the work of the
society and the community, modeling effective leadership and problem solving skills,
demonstrating how to accomplish change for the common good. (p. 2)
Our study ultimately suggests one potential area in which colleges and universities can nurture
students’ social engagement—students’ leadership in student organizations.
Conclusions
Our study suggests a link between students’ positional leadership and roles as social change
agents - a link that holds potential to influence their civic and social change engagement in
college and beyond. Furthermore, we discovered that students who participated as positional
leaders in some types of organizations - advocacy groups, Greek fraternities or sororities,
political groups, religious groups, and service groups - were more likely to engage in social
change. Given increasing pressure on higher education institutions to develop civically engaged
students, this research suggests that colleges and universities can increase students’ engagement
in social change by encouraging their participation in leadership activities.
