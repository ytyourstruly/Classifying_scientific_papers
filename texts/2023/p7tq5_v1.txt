Abstract
The transition from secondary to higher education can be challenging for students. They have to
adjust academically and must integrate into a new social environment. Successful social integration is
important for university students’ academic success and well-being. Previous studies illustrate that
personality traits shape social behavior. However, research on the impact of personality traits on
social integration in the university context is scarce. In this study, we investigate how students’ Big
Five personality traits influence the level and development of their social integration. We analyze
whether the fit of the students’ Big Five profile with their chosen major affects their social
integration. We differentiate social integration with teaching staff and social integration with fellow
students. We use the student cohort of the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) for our analysis.
We observed students for up to four academic years and estimated growth curve models with
random intercept and random slope. The results show that all Big Five traits are significantly
associated with both forms of social integration at the end of the first academic year, with the
exception of extraversion and openness. While extraversion is only significant for social integration
with fellow students, openness is only relevant for social integration with teaching staff. A poor
person-environment fit regarding personality is significantly negatively linked to both forms of social
integration at the end of the first academic year. However, the Big Five traits and person-
environment fit affect the level of social integration only but not the development of social
integration.

1. Introduction
The transition from secondary to higher education can be a challenging time for students. Most
students leave their parental home, former teachers, and friends, and must build a new support
network on campus. Successful social integration of university students is characterized by positive
and frequent interactions with fellow students and teaching staff and a sense of belonging to the
college community (Tinto 1975).
Previous research emphasizes the importance of university students’ social integration in different
aspects of their lives. A lack of social connectedness negatively affects college students’ mental
health (Calderan 2012), their motivation, and academic success (Trolian et al. 2016; Bronkema and
Bowman 2019). In his widely applied model of student departure, Tinto (1975) argues that low social
integration with other students and teaching staff is one of the crucial factors for student retention.
Because of the importance of social integration for university students, researchers are interested in
the determinants of students’ social integration. For example, previous studies investigated the
effect of age (Rubin and Wright 2015), ethnicity (Rienties et al. 2012), and socioeconomic status
(Rubin 2012) on students’ social integration in their first college years. However, these previous
studies do not give a full picture of the determinants of social integration, because the size of the
observed effects tends to be small or medium (e.g., Rubin (2012) finds in a meta-analysis an average
effect size for social class of r ~ 0.8). One determinant that has not yet been considered in research is
students’ Big Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism, conscientiousness,
and openness). The Big Five are linked to various academic outcomes, such as GPA (Vedel 2014).
Previous studies on social networking behavior illustrate that the Big Five personality traits shape
social behavior (Selden and Goodie 2018). University students’ social integration comprises different
forms of social networking behavior that might be linked to their Big Five traits. Therefore, in the
present study, we investigate whether the Big Five personality traits are a determinant of students’
social integration in the university context. We aim to address the existing research gap by analyzing
two research questions. First, we analyze the association of the Big Five dimensions with university
students’ social integration with students and teaching staff. Second, students in a major represent a
selective group in terms of their personality (Humburg 2017). Based on person-environment-fit
theory, we expect that students with a greater personality “fit” to the average personality profile of
their major experience better social integration with fellow students and teaching staff.
We are not only interested in the effect of students’ personality traits on the extent of, but also on
the development of their social integration. Previous studies have predominantly focused on the
determinants of social integration in students’ freshmen and sophomore years. However, Terenzini
and Wright (1987) found that social integration becomes more influential in college students’ senior
years. Nevertheless, little is known about the development of students’ social integration. Mannan
(2007) shows that students’ average satisfaction with their social integration varies between senior
and junior years. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relevance of personality traits
for students’ social integration, we trace social integration longitudinally over a period of up to four
years. We aim to determine, firstly, how students’ social integration develops over the course of
their studies and, secondly, whether personality traits and a personality match with the field of study
increase students’ social integration over time or at least protect them from a loss of social
integration.
We use longitudinal data from the student cohort of the German National Educational Panel Study
(NEPS)1 to address these research questions. The data allow us to observe the social integration with
fellow students and teaching staff of university students who enrolled in 2010 over the course of four
years. We estimate growth curve models with random intercept and slope.
2. The impact of personality traits on university students’ social integration
Personality traits are defined as patterns of thoughts, feelings, and actions. Since the 1990s, the Big
Five personality model is the empirically best-established and most widely used personality model
(McCrae and Costa 1999). The Big Five personality framework organizes personality traits into five
factors labeled: extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism (or emotional stability), openness, and
conscientiousness. The five personality traits are relatively stable across different situations and over
time (Costa and McCrae 1994). The Big Five taxonomy parsimoniously captures “personality
regularities within and differences between people” (Tulin et al. 2018, p.298).
To the best of our knowledge, the direct impact of the Big Five personality traits on students’ social
integration in the university context has not yet been analyzed. However, a large body of literature
(for reviews, see Selden and Goodie 2018; Landis 2016) shows that the Big Five are linked to different
aspects of social behavior. Although the effects of the Big Five vary depending on the specific aspect
of social behavior investigated, the Big Five domains with the strongest theoretical and empirical
links to social behavior are extraversion and agreeableness (Selden and Goodie 2018). Extravert
individuals prefer social over solitary activities. They have larger personal networks, more friends
than introverted people, and are more prone to finding new contacts (Selden and Goodie 2018). In
contrast, extraversion appears to be less important for maintaining and using existing contacts (Wolff
and Kim 2012). However, Roberts et al. (2008) find that extraversion is only positively correlated with
the number of closer acquaintances but not with weaker ties. Furthermore, the authors discover in
1 This paper uses data from the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS): Starting Cohort Students,
doi:10.5157/NEPS:SC5:11.0.0. from 2008 to 2013. NEPS data was collected as part of the Framework Program
for the Promotion of Empirical Educational Research funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and
Research (BMBF). As of 2014, NEPS is carried out by the Leibniz Institute for Educational Trajectories (LIfBi) at
the University of Bamberg in cooperation with a nationwide network.
their study that extraversion is negatively correlated with age, and when age is controlled, there is no
longer any relevant correlation between extraversion and network size.
A second Big Five domain with obvious links to social behavior is agreeableness. Agreeable
individuals are friendly and seek to maintain social harmony (Cuperman and Ickes 2009). They have
less conflicts and more stable personal networks (Asendorpf and Wilpers 1998; Berry et al. 2000;
Wagner et al. 2014; Tulin et al. 2018). Agreeableness facilitates the maintenance of relationships and
positively affects close relationships (Selden and Goodie 2018; Vasalampi et al. 2014). Some studies
find a positive effect of agreeableness on the formation of new friendship ties, but others find no
significant effects of agreeableness on network size (Selden and Goodie 2018). Overall, previous
studies suggest that agreeableness has some positive effect on the size of personal networks.
The other three Big Five domains have some, albeit weaker and less direct links to social behavior.
Openness to experience is positively correlated to network heterogeneity. Open individuals are
curious and broad-minded. This makes them prone to connect with new and diverse people (Tulin et
al. 2018). Studies suggest that open college students gain more new non-kin contacts over time (Zhu
et al. 2013; Wagner et al. 2014). Openness also fosters the maintenance of social relationships
because open individuals often exchange new information with existing social ties (Wolff and Kim
2012). Wolff and Kim (2012) find a positive correlation between openness and maintaining business
contacts, but not with building new business contacts.
Neuroticism is obstructive to social networking. Emotionally unstable individuals have less emotional
resources to invest in others and tend to have poorer social skills. Additionally, others often view
them negatively (Smółka and Szulawski 2011) Neuroticism seems to be unrelated to network size or
composition, even though it is negatively correlated to building new friendships (Selden and Goodie
2018). In contrast, Roberts et al. (2008) find a negative correlation between neuroticism and the
number of looser acquaintances.
Conscientiousness typically plays only a marginal role in networking behavior. Conscientiousness is
important for task-related behavior and less for social behavior (Wolff and Kim 2012). Nevertheless,
conscientiousness is related to planned action and impulse control. Therefore, conscientious
individuals seem more reliable and trustworthy (Tulin et al. 2018). Previous studies indicate that
conscientiousness is not related to network size as a whole but is associated with more kin ties within
the personal network (Selden and Goodie 2018).
The Big Five personality traits and students’ social integration
The foregoing review demonstrates that the Big Five personality traits impact individuals’ social
behavior and, hence, the quality and quantity of their social ties. However, the influence of the Big
Five traits differs with the observed aspects of social networks. University students’ social integration
involves many different aspects of social networking behavior, i.e., building new contacts,
maintaining existing ones, building a large network of friends and acquaintances, and positive
interaction with teachers, all in the university context. The effect of the Big Five on university
students’ overall social integration has to date not been investigated and remains an open research
question. We attempt to close this research gap and argue that the Big Five personality traits affect
students’ social contacts in the university environment and, ultimately, their social integration with
fellow students and teaching staff. We expect that extraversion, agreeableness, emotional stability,
and openness to experience have a positive effect on social integration with fellow students and
teaching staff. Although conscientiousness is less important for social networking behavior (Wolff
and Kim 2012), we expect it to play a role for students. Conscientiousness is strongly connected to
academic attainment, such as the GPA (van Bragt et al. 2011; Vedel 2014). High achievers represent
valuable networking partners for fellow students and are probably more popular with teaching staff.
Therefore, we expect that conscientiousness has a positive effect on social integration. Furthermore,
personality traits that foster continuously seeking new social ties and maintaining existing social
relationships should increase students’ social integration over time or at least prevent a decline in
social integration. To summarize, we hypothesize that extraversion, agreeableness, emotional
stability, openness, and conscientiousness are positively associated with students’ level and
development of social integration with fellow students and teaching staff (H1).
3. The effect of student-environment-fit on social integration
According to Lewin (1936), human behavior can be explained as the function of a person, including
their personality, motivation, and environment. The extent to which individuals and their
personalities fit in their environment affects their achievement, satisfaction, and withdrawal
behavior. The supplementary model of person-environment congruence defines person-environment
fit as a person fitting into an environment because they possess attributes that are similar to the
other people in this environment (Muchinsky and Monahan 1987). According to this model, people
want to minimize misfit (Kandler and Rauthmann 2021). Tinto (1975) applies this theory to his model
of student departure. He argues that student-institution misfit, i.e., students’ incongruency with the
social and academic environment at a specific institution of higher education, fosters drop-out.
Accordingly, students’ social integration depends not only on their individual social skills but also on
their fit into the social environment in their institution of higher education, specifically, in their
chosen major.
Within the educational institution, students interact mostly with the fellow students and the
teaching staff in their major. Hence, to feel socially integrated, students must “fit” with their fellow
students and the teaching staff in their field of study. Here, we argue that different fields of study
might differ in terms of the typical personality profiles of the types of students they attract, such that
a student’s personality may be a better or worse fit to the typical personality profile of their field of
study. We expect that the “personality-fit” to a field of study, in turn, affects students’ social
integration.
Students in a major represent a selective group regarding their personality. Students in a field of
study share, for example, political attitudes, communication behavior, and general patterns of
perception, thoughts, and action (Weigand 2014). Furthermore, previous research demonstrates that
the Big Five are all linked to the field of study choice. For example, individuals with high levels of
extraversion are more likely to choose law and less likely to choose mathematics or natural science
(Humburg 2017). Consequently, we can assume that students in the same field of study share similar
levels of extraversion, agreeableness, openness, neuroticism, and conscientiousness. Therefore, a
specific personality profile is part of a field of study culture.
Similarity, including in personality, breeds attraction. Social relationships of any type, such as
marriage, friendships, or work-related relationships, tend to follow the principle of homophily.
People seek relationships with others with similar characteristics regarding age, ethnicity, social class,
and gender (McPherson et al. 2001). Several theories attempt to explain this phenomenon.
According to the reinforcement-affect model, individuals prefer homophilic relationships because
similarities in taste, attitudes, and values between individuals create more pleasurable interactions
and reinforce individuals’ opinions, feelings, and perceptions of the world (Izard 1960; Byrne 1971).
Uncertainty reduction theory suggests that shared values make interaction partners more
predictable, easing communication and supporting friendship formation (Berger and Calabrese
1975). Several empirical studies show that homophily regarding personality traits plays a role in
forming new friendships in larger social environments (Bahns et al. 2017; Selden and Goodie 2018;
Laakasuo et al. 2020). University students tend to select friends with similar levels of extraversion,
agreeableness, and openness and the perceived similarity in personality traits predicts students’
higher friendship intensity (Selfhout et al. 2009). Furthermore, personality similarity regarding
extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness eases college students’ interaction with new
acquaintances (Cuperman and Ickes 2009; Kurtz and Sherker 2003).
Based on these theoretical assumptions and research findings, we argue that the personality fit
between students and the social environment in their field of study fosters social integration.
Furthermore, a good student-field of study fit should facilitate the formation of stable relationships
and more intense friendships, increasing social integration over time. This leads to the following
hypothesis: A higher deviation of students’ personality from the average personality profile of
students in their major is negatively associated with the level and development of students' social
integration with fellow students and teaching staff (H2).
4. Data and methods
Sample
We used the university student cohort (Starting Cohort 5) of the German National Educational Panel
Study (NEPS-SC5) as the data for our analyses. NEPS-SC5 is a representative panel survey in Germany
which follows 17,910 first-year undergraduate students who enrolled in a full university or university
of applied science2 for the first time in Fall 2010. Students are interviewed twice a year. Data are
Students’ self-report on social integration is measured once a year, up to four times per student
altogether. Hence, we restrict our sample to students’ first four years of study. Social integration is
measured for the first time in Fall 2011, i.e., around one year after student enrollment. Hence, our
sample is restricted to students who do not drop out or switch majors before the first measurement
of social integration. We are building a homogenous sample. We observe students only as long as
they remain in the same major or majors at the same university, which they chose initially in 2010. A
change of major or university implies a new social environment, within which students must again
integrate. Therefore, changes of major or university contort the development of students’
integration over time. Additionally, a change of major results in a different fit between the
personality profile of the major and the students’ personality. Within the observation period of four
years, 61% of the students in our sample graduate, 13% are still studying but have not yet graduated,
10% dropped out or switched their major and 16% are panel dropouts.
Missing values are imputed for a subset of variables with multiple imputation by chained equations
(m=100). The sample restriction and listwise deletion for non-imputed variables leave a sample size
of 8,941 students (62% female and 38% male). Students are, on average, 22 years old at the first
analysis sample3.

Analyses
To analyze the development of students’ social integration over the four-year period, we conduct
multilevel growth curve models with random intercepts and random slopes. Due to the nested data
structure, two-level models are estimated in which time represents level 1 and students represent
level 2. The models account for the nesting of up to four academic years within the students.
Furthermore, clustered standard errors account for the lowest sampling unit, i.e., the combination of
subject area and university at the aggregate level. Nine subject areas are differentiated: linguistics/
cultural studies, sports, law/economics/social science, mathematics/natural science, human
medicine/health studies, agricultural and nutritional science/forestry, engineering, and fine arts.
Time is included as the linear variable “academic year” in the models.
We estimate separate models for the two types of social integration, i.e., social integration with
fellow students and with teaching staff. For each type of social integration, we conduct two models,
one including the students’ absolute level of the Big Five traits and one with the students’ deviation
of the Big Five from the subject mean. This is necessary because of the multicollinearity between the
Big Five of a person and the person’s deviation from the subject mean regarding their Big Five traits.
Measures
Social integration
The measure of social integration follows Tinto’s theoretical model and is adapted for the German
context (Dahm and Lauterbach 2016). The items capture quality and quantity of the students’
interactions with fellow students and teaching staff. Social integration with fellow students is
measured by three items on the Social Integration Scale (Schiefele et al. 2002). Students rate how
much the following statements apply to them: “I have been successful in building contacts with other
students during my studies to date”, “I know a lot of classmates with whom I can exchange ideas
about questions in my field of study”, and “I have many contacts with students in my cohort”
(response options for all items range from 1 – does not apply at all, to 4 – completely applies). The
three-item scale shows a good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha .84). We built an index by
taking the unit-weighted mean over all three items of the construct.
Social integration with teaching staff focuses on student-faculty interaction on campus. In the
German context, off-campus interactions with teaching staff are rare and do not play a major role.
Four items cover this aspect of social integration: “I feel accepted by the instructors”, “I get along
well with the instructors in my degree program”, “most of the instructors treat me fairly”, “the
instructors are interested in what I have to say” (response options range from 1 – does not apply at
all, to 4 – completely applies). The scale shows a sufficient internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha
=.79). We built an index with the unit-weighted mean over all four items of the construct4.
Big Five Personality traits
The Big Five dimensions are measured by the 10-item Big Five Inventory (BFI-10), developed by
Rammstedt and John (2007). The BFI-10 is an ultra-short instrument that consists of 10 items, two for
each Big Five dimension. In the NEPS, , an additional third item for “agreeableness” was included to
increase construct coverage and enhance the reliability of this dimension, leading to an 11-item
instrument5. The BFI-10 shows sufficient reliability and validity (Rammstedt et al. 2013) and, despite
its brevity, achieves similar predictive validity to (much) longer Big Five inventories (Rammstedt et al.
2021). The Big Five were measured once during our observation period, in Spring 2012, i.e., around
1.5 years after student enrollment and ca. 6 months after the first measurement of social integration.
Ideally, the Big Five would be measured before or directly after enrollment. However, whereas
personality change is most pronounced in childhood and adolescence, much less change happens
after age 20 (Soto et al. 2011). Roberts and DelVecchio’s (2000) meta-analysis illustrates that
personality traits become more stable with increasing age and are relatively robust. During age 18-
21, the consistency is around .51; during age 22-29 it increases to .57.
In our data, the Big Five are measured a second time, in 2016 (outside our observation period). A
comparison of the two measurements of the Big Five confirms a substantial test–retest correlation
across the 4-year period (ranging between r=.53 and .68 per trait). We therefore assume that
personality is quite stable. For students who drop out or switch their major before the measurement
of the Big Five, the missing values on the Big Five dimensions are imputed.
Deviation of the Big Five
The student-environment fit is defined as the deviation of the university students’ Big Five traits from
the personality profile of their major. To operationalize the personality profile of the different
the different subject areas in the first academic year. The three biggest subject areas are teaching (34
%), engineering (14 %), and economics and management science (12 %). Students aiming for a
teaching degree are grouped in a separate subject area, independent from the majors they are
enrolled in. These students are oversampled in NEPS-SC5. They visit the same classes as other
students enrolled in the same majors but who are not aiming for a teaching degree. However, these
students take additional pedagogical classes which are designed for students aiming for teaching

degrees only. Hence, they must also build social contacts with teaching staff and students outside the
student body of their majors to feel fully integrated. Furthermore, students who want to become
teachers might differ from the other students in the same subject group according to their
personality. Moreover, a large number of students aiming for a teaching degree (67 %) have two or
more majors which do not belong to the same subject group6. These students could also create a bias
in the definition of the personality profiles of the subject groups if not treated as a separate group.
Fig. 1: Distribution of students in the 12 subject areas
For each of the 12 subject areas, we estimate the mean for each of the Big Five dimensions over all
students who are enrolled in the subject area in 2012, when the Big Five are measured. For this
estimate we also include students who, in 2012, are no longer enrolled in the first major(s) they
chose in 2010. 43 of the students are enrolled in two or three majors, which belong to different
subject areas. The Big Five traits of these students are included in the estimation of the Big Five mean
for the subject areas of all their majors. Graph 2 shows the average of the Big Five traits for each
subject area. The differences between the means of different subject areas are small but in most
cases statistically significant. For example, linguistics and human medicine students and students
aiming for a teaching degree are, on average, significantly more extraverted, agreeable,
conscientious, neurotic, and open than engineering students.
6 Overall, 21 % of all students in the sample are enrolled in two majors, 1 % in three majors. 2,003 students in
the sample are enrolled in two or three majors which do not belong to the same subject area. Only 43 of these
students are not aiming for a teaching degree.
Fig. 2: Mean of the Big Five traits for all subject areas
Overall, the differences between the means demonstrate that the student body of each subject area
can be characterized by a distinct Big Five personality profile.
In the next step, we compute each student's similarity with the typical personality profile of students
in the same subject area(s).
For students with major(s) that belong to the same subject area, we use the following equation:
∆ = ∑ [𝑥 − 𝑦̅ ] , (1)
𝑖 𝑘𝑖 𝑘𝑙
𝑘=1
where ∆ denotes the deviation of the student i from the average personality profile of students
with the same subject area, k denotes each of the five personality traits, 𝑥 denotes the individual
𝑘𝑖
score of the student i on the respective personality trait k, l denotes the student’s subject area, and
𝑦̅ denotes the mean over all students of the individuals’ subject area l on the respective Big Five
𝑘𝑙
dimension k. For example, for an economics student, we subtract the average extraversion score of
all economic students (𝑦̅ ) in our sample from the student’s individual extraversion score (𝑥 ) and
𝑘𝑙 𝑘𝑖
take the square from the result. We repeat this calculation for all other four Big Five traits and sum
up the results for all Big Five traits. The result is the student’s overall deviation from the economics
personality profile.
For students with majors that belong to two or three different subject areas, equation (1) can be
modified as the following:
∑ 𝑦̅
𝑗=1 𝑘𝑙𝑗
∆ = ∑ [𝑥 − ( )] (2)
𝑖 𝑘𝑖
𝑘=1
Here, m denotes the number of subject areas to which the students’ majors belong (m=2 or m=3).
For example, for a student enrolled in art and economics, we calculate the mean of all art students
for the particular Big Five trait and the mean of all economics students for the Big Five traits. Then we
sum up the two means and divide the result by two. We subtract the result from the student’s
individual score on the respective Big Five trait and take its square. Finally, we repeat this calculation
for the other four Big Five traits and sum up the results for all Big Five traits.
Control variables
We control for students’ background characteristics that may be related to both personality and
social integration in all models: migration background (yes/no), parental education (1: both parents
have no tertiary degree, 0: at least one parent has a tertiary degree), and age at enrollment as a
centered variable. We include characteristics of the program students are enrolled in: university of
applied science (1) or a full university (0). Furthermore, the students’ subject areas are included in
the models. For the students with more than one major that belong to different subject areas, the
subject area of the major that students report as the first major is used.
An important factor for self-selection in subject areas is students’ high-school achievement.
Achievement is highly correlated with personality traits, such as conscientiousness and
agreeableness (Vedel 2014). Furthermore, high-achieving students are more attractive social
networking partners. Hence, we control for students’ high-school leaving certificate GPAs.
Additionally, the employment status (working yes/no) and children in the household (yes/no) are
included as time-variant variables and measured in every one of the four academic years. These
factors restrict students’ time on campus and energy to build social contacts. The experience of
working part-time or taking care of a child while studying might impact students’ personalities. In
turn, the decision to work or have a child could be influenced by students’ personalities.

the four academic years. Social integration with fellow students declines slightly over time. This
might be explained by the fact that students probably have contact with many other students at the
beginning of their studies, trying to find acquaintances with whom they get along well. After a while,
with teaching staff stays almost constant during the four academic years, only marginally increasing.

staff (right) over the first four academic years
Multivariate results for social integration with fellow students
In the next step, we estimate growth curve models with social integration with fellow students as the
the two models.
Both models illustrate that students’ social integration with fellow students significantly declines
over time, confirming the descriptive results. Social integration slightly decreases by about 4.4
percentage points with one additional academic year. In Model 1, the individual levels of all Big Five
traits are included in the model as predictors of the random intercept. The results are partly in line
with our Hypothesis 1. Extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness are significantly positively
connected to social integration with fellow students at the end of the first academic year. In contrast,
neuroticism is significantly negatively linked to social integration. However, openness is positively but
not significantly connected to social integration. Extraversion and agreeableness have the strongest
association with social integration with fellow students. In Model 2, only the deviation of students’
Big Five traits from the subject group mean is included in the model, but not the individual Big Five

dimensions. In line with our Hypothesis 2, the deviation from the subject group mean is negatively
associated with social integration with fellow students at the end of the first academic year. The
association is relatively weak but statistically highly significant. Hence, students with a worse person-
environment fit regarding their personality rate lower in terms of social integration at the end of the
first academic year than students with a better fit.

***p<.001, **p<.01; *p<.05
To find out whether the Big Five traits themselves and the deviation of the Big Five traits from the
subject group mean also affect the development of students’ social integration with fellow students,
i.e., the random slope, we estimate interaction effects between each covariate and the time
effects are close to zero and non-significant. Consequently, neither the absolute Big Five traits nor
the deviation from the subject group has an impact on the decline of students’ social integration with
fellow students over the course of their study. Consequently, Hypotheses 1 and 2 can only be
supported in terms of the association of most of the personality traits and the deviation with the
absolute level of social integration but not with the development of social integration over time.

the dependent variable. In line with the descriptive results, social integration with teaching staff
increases marginally but not significantly over time. Model 1 contains the Big Five traits as predictors
of the random intercept. In line with our expectations, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and
openness are positively linked with social integration with teaching staff, while neuroticism is
negatively associated with social integration at the end of the first academic year. In contrast,
extraversion is positively but not significantly connected to social integration with teaching staff.
Therefore, Hypothesis 1 is partly supported. The impact of students’ absolute Big Five traits on social
integration with teaching staff is weaker than their impact on social integration with fellow students.
Furthermore, a good relationship with university teachers does not depend on students’ level of
extraversion At the same time, extraversion is the personality trait having the strongest association
with students’ relationships with other students. However, openness seems to be more important
for a good relationship with teachers than with fellow students. In line with our Hypothesis 2, the
deviation of the Big Five from the subject mean is negatively linked to social integration with
teaching staff (Model 2). The effect is weak but statistically significant.

In the next step, we investigate whether the Big Five traits and the deviation of the Big Five traits
from the subject mean affect the development of students’ social integration with teaching staff, i.e.,
personality covariates. Similar to the results for social integration with fellow students, there are no
significant interaction effects, with one exception. High levels of conscientiousness negatively impact
in detail. We can see that students with very high levels of conscientiousness experience a
significantly smaller increase in social integration with teaching staff over time. However, very
conscientious students report a better social integration in the first place. The differences in the
social integration increase are only significant in the first two years. Over time, students with lower
conscientiousness seem to catch up regarding their social integration with teaching staff, and, in the
fourth academic year, there are no longer any significant differences. Overall, we conclude that the
Big Five traits and the deviation of the Big Five mostly do not positively affect the development of
social integration with teaching staff. Hence, Hypothesis 2 cannot be supported.

We performed additional analyses with a more restricted sample to test the robustness of our
results. We limited the sample to students who either earn a degree in their first major within the
observed four academic years or are still enrolled in their first major in the fourth academic year. The
results confirm our previous findings and point to robust results (see Appendix).
6. Conclusion
This study aimed to ascertain whether university students’ Big Five personality traits and person-
environment fit affect the level and development of students’ social integration. Person-environment
fit was defined as the similarity of students’ individual Big Five traits and the average Big Five traits of
the other students in the subject group in which the students are enrolled. We conducted separate
growth curve models for social integration with fellow students and teaching staff with random
intercept and random slope.
Previous studies demonstrated that agreeableness and extraversion have the strongest theoretical
and empirical link to social behavior. Our results for the random intercept confirm that
agreeableness has one of the strongest positive associations with both forms of social integration at
the end of the first academic year. Extraversion is the most important personality trait for social
integration with fellow students. However, extraversion does not play a significant role in social
integration with teaching staff. A possible explanation for this phenomenon could be that the
measurement of social integration with teaching staff in the NEPS-SC5 focuses more on the quality
than the quantity of contact with teaching staff. Extraversion is mainly important for building many
new contacts and less relevant for weaker ties (Roberts et al. 2008). Although previous empirical
studies cannot find a strong link between conscientiousness and networking behavior, we expected it
to be significant for social behavior in an academic setting. Our results illustrate that
conscientiousness is significantly positively linked to social integration with fellow students and
teaching staff at the end of the first academic year. According to previous empirical studies,
neuroticism and openness play a smaller role in social networking behavior. Our analyses show that
both emotional stability and openness are positively linked to social integration at the end of the first
academic year. However, openness is the least important personality trait for social integration with
teaching staff, and the connection between openness and social integration with fellow students is
not significant. Open individuals are curious and interested in new information, and, hence, openness
is a valuable trait for maintaining weaker contacts (Wolff and Kim 2012). In an academic setting, it
seems reasonable that openness is especially valuable for the relationship with teaching staff within
the classroom. Interested students are likely to be more popular with teachers.
Results for the random intercept on the person-environment fit support our expectations. Low
student-major fit regarding the personality is significantly negatively associated with both forms of
social integration at the end of the first academic year. Students with a personality that deviates
from the other students’ average personality in their major tend to have less and lower quality
contacts with fellow students and teaching staff. However, the effects of person-environment fit are
quite small. Overall, the direct effect of students’ individual level Big Five traits seems to be more
important for their social integration at the end of the first academic year.
In the next step, we were interested in the development of social integration over time. Results
demonstrate that social integration with fellow students decreases slightly but significantly over
time. In contrast, social integration with teaching staff remains constant over time. The results of the
random slope illustrate that the development of both forms of social integration is not affected by
students’ individual personality traits or their person-environment fit regarding their personality.
Hence, students’ personality cannot protect them from a loss of social integration over time or even
foster an increase in social integration over time. . Overall, personality seems to shape mainly
students’ initial level of social integration in the first academic year.
However, this study has some limitations. Firstly, there is a selection effect. Students’ Big Five
personality traits affect their choice of major (Humburg 2017). Therefore, most students that enroll
in a specific major already possess a relatively good person-environment fit regarding their
personality from the start. Students with a very bad person-environment fit probably would not
enroll in that particular major in the first place or will leave their first chosen major and will no longer
be part of our sample. Thus, with increasing academic years, the sample will contain fewer students
with a bad environment fit. This might explain the relatively small effects of person-environment fit
on social integration found in this study. We conducted robustness checks to test the robustness of
our results. We replicated the analyses with a sample restricted to students who remained in their
initially chosen major for all observed four academic years. The results were the same as in our
original sample.
Secondly, unfortunately, students’ social integration and Big Five personality traits are not measured
directly after enrollment but at 1 and 1.5 years respectively after enrollment. Although personality is
quite stable in college years, it might still change slightly over time. Furthermore, students who leave
the major before the first measurement of social integration are not included in our sample.
Therefore, our analyses might underestimate the effects of person-environment on social integration
because students with a bad fit and, hence, bad social integration might drop out before completing
the first academic year.
Thirdly, the Big Five personality traits are measured only once within our observation period. Hence,
our analyses cannot reveal reciprocal effects of social integration and the Big Five personality traits.
Theoretically, it is possible that students partly adapt their personality, or at least adapt the
perception of their own personality to their social environment to increase person-environment fit
instead of dropping out of the environment. However, we believe that the influence of personality
on the choice of social environment is stronger than attempts to adapt the personality to the
environment. Nevertheless, we recommend replicating our analyses with a sample with an earlier
measurement and multiple measurements of personality and person-environment fit within the
observation period.
Nevertheless, the results illustrate that students’ Big Five traits and their person-environment fit
regarding their personality are important factors for students’ formation of social integration and,
consequently, their well-being and dropout risk. In comparison to previously investigated predictors
of students’ social integration, such as parental education, gender, age, migration background, and
working (included as covariates in our models), our results show that the individual Big Five
dimensions have a larger or at least equally large connection to social integration. Person-
environment fit is a weaker determinant, and for social integration with teaching staff it is negligibly
small. Overall, this study demonstrates that not only vocational interests and academic abilities
define the fit between students and a major but also their personality. Consequently, university
career centers should also consider students’ Big Five personality traits and the personality profile of
a major when supporting students to find the right major.
