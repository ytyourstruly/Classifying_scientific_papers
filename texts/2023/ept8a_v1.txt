LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 2
Abstract
As the threat of climate change looms large, and we experience first-hand the impacts of rapid
global warming, researchers and clinicians emphasize the need to better understand the impact of
these changes on our mental health. Existing research suggests that coping with and emotional
reactions to climate change can promote action to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate
change and reduce its negative impacts to one’s mental health. In this pre-registered study (N =
771) we examined whether people who display extreme intergenerational concern would also
constructively cope with climate change. Empirically-identified individuals showing high
intergenerational concern reported more problem-focused and meaning-based coping, and less
avoidant coping strategies with climate change. Further, even though they felt guilty, angry,
sorrowful and isolated, these individuals also felt hopeful about the future. These effects were
explained by increased concerns about one’s legacy and higher access to environmental cognitive
alternatives. By instilling values that highlight intergenerational concern as a key priority, we
could thus not only increase pro-climate action, but also help individuals actively and
constructively cope with changes produced by climate change.

Intergenerational Concern Relates to Constructive Coping and Emotional Reactions to Climate
Change via Increased Legacy Concerns and Environmental Cognitive Alternatives
As climate threats reach unprecedented heights (Horton, 2023; IPCC, 2023; Paddison,
2023; Sally Younger, 2023), a growing consensus among researchers and clinicians underscores
the pressing need to expand our perspective beyond physical environmental repercussions and
recognize the impact of the ongoing climate crisis on the mental health and well-being of our
global community (Beever et al., 2017; Fuller et al., 2010; Mah et al., 2020; Marczak, Wierzba,
Zaremba, et al., 2023; Ojala, 2012; Ostrom, 2009; Shrum et al., 2023). Emerging research in this
vein underscores the impact of climate change on mental health, but also that coping strategies
and emotional reactions strongly predict pro-environmental engagement (Ojala & Bengtsson,
2019; Verplanken et al., 2020). Yet, the effects of climate change are projected only to intensify
over time, with its most substantial consequences expected to profoundly shape the distant future
of humanity (Bradley et al., 2020; Dryzek et al., 2011; IPCC, 2022). The growing social
movement and ethical philosophy of longtermism explicitly advocates for protecting the welfare
of future generations (Greaves & MacAskill, 2019; MacAskill, 2022; Ord, 2021), and nascent
psychological inquiry into longtermism beliefs highlights that individuals with a strong sense of
intergenerational concern tend to exhibit heightened pro-environmental attitudes and engagement
(Law, Syropoulos, Coleman, et al., 2023; Law, Syropoulos, & Young, 2023a; Syropoulos, Law,
Kraft-Todd, et al., 2023; Syropoulos, Law, & Young, 2023d, 2023a).
Drawing upon existing theory and evidence, we investigate whether individuals showing
a high amount of intergenerational concern (1) cope with climate change more constructively and
(2) emotionally respond with both more concern and hope relative to general population controls.
We also explore whether legacy concerns (Zaval et al., 2015) and the ability to generate
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 4
cognitive alternatives to the current environmental status quo (Wright et al., 2020) mediate any
noted effects of intergenerational concern on coping and emotional reactions to climate change.
Measuring Intergenerational Concern Using the Longtermism Beliefs Scale
Longtermism refers to an ethical philosophy advocating equal concern for current and
future generations (Cody Fenwick, 2023; Greaves & MacAskill, 2019; MacAskill, 2022; Ord,
2021; Panzer, 2021) and a social movement with a modest but dedicated and rapidly expanding
following (Fisher, 2023; Moorhouse, 2021; Samuel, 2022). Longtermist ideology is guided by
three key principles: (1) expressing concern for the well-being of future generations, (2)
acknowledging the vast potential of humanity if extinction risks are reduced, and (3) recognizing
the current generation’s capacity to shape a positive future for humankind. Thus, longtermism is
very much synonymous with showing a large degree of intergenerational concern.
Despite the longtermism movement being subject to numerous criticisms in the popular
press (Emba, 2022; Fisher, 2023), the longtermism philosophy provides a structured framework
for studying the psychological dynamics of intergenerational concern. Emerging research in this
vein from social psychology and cognitive science has employed the Longtermism Beliefs Scale
(LBS; Syropoulos, Law, Kraft-Todd, et al., 2023), which leverages items derived directly from
eminent philosophical writings concerning longtermist principles (e.g., MacAskill, 2022; Ord,
2021) to better understand the psychological antecedents and consequences of endorsing them. A
significant portion of this research employs a scoring approach to categorize participants into
two distinct subject groups: “longtermists,” who show substantial levels of intergenerational
concern for both near and distant future generations, and general population controls, who either
do not show above average levels of intergenerational concern or exhibit a declining level of
concern for future generations as the timeframe under consideration extends further into the
future (Syropoulos et al., 2023; Syropoulos, Law, Kraft-Todd, et al., 2023; Syropoulos, Law, &
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 5
Young, 2023d, 2023a, 2023b). In essence, empirically classified longtermists show a marked
departure from the prevailing tendency displayed by most individuals (Bang et al., 2017;
Hurlstone et al., 2020; Wade-Benzoni, 1999, 2008, 2017) to consistently undervalue the well-
being of future generations.
The Psychological and Pro-Environmental Profiles of Intergenerational Concern
Longtermists empirically identified through the LBS exhibit not only a greater likelihood
of self-identifying with the longtermism philosophy, but also a robust profile characterized by
intergenerational concern, prosocial tendencies, and farsighted attitudes and behaviors
(Syropoulos et al., 2023; Syropoulos, Law, Kraft-Todd, et al., 2023). For instance, longtermists
exhibit greater moral consideration for the welfare of individuals in distant future generations
and also extend their moral concern to present-day outgroups relative to controls, ascribing to
them elevated human-like capacities and characteristics (Law, Syropoulos, Coleman, et al., 2023;
Syropoulos, Law, & Young, 2023a). To further corroborate the connection between longtermism
beliefs and prosocial tendencies, we can turn to the literature on moral expansiveness and
dehumanization. A substantial body of literature has established a relationship between
possessing a broad moral circle and reduced dehumanization tendencies with prosocial
inclinations that surpass the typical parochial biases often constraining prosociality in the broader
population (Bruneau et al., 2017; Crimston et al., 2016, 2018; Graham et al., 2017; Haslam,
2006; Kteily & Bruneau, 2017; Rottman et al., 2021). Relatedly, longtermists demonstrate
heightened levels of expansive altruism that extend across social distance and elevated utilitarian
decision-making. Longtermist personality profiles are characterized by patterns of traits on the
BIG-5 and HEXACO inventories (see Oda & Matsumoto-Oda, 2022; Soto & John, 2017) as well
as on measures of Dark Tetrad traits (see Jonason et al., 2010; Palmer & Tackett, 2018; Paulhus
et al., 2021) and Primal World Beliefs (Clifton, 2023), which are strongly aligned (see Marsh,
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 6
2019; Rhoads et al., 2023) with prosocial behavior (Syropoulos et al., 2023; Syropoulos, Law,
Kraft-Todd, et al., 2023; Syropoulos, Law, & Young, 2023d, 2023b, 2023a). In terms of
behaviors, longtermists, when compared to members of the general population, tend to make
larger donations to charities benefitting future generations, show more support for farsighted
public policies, and are more inclined to invest cognitive effort for the betterment of future
generations (Syropoulos, Law, Kraft-Todd, et al., 2023; Syropoulos, Law, & Young, 2023b).
However, beyond demonstrating consistent patterns of heightened intergenerational and
present-day prosocial attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, longtermists also exhibit consistent
patterns of pro-environmental attitudes and both top-down and bottom-up pro-environmental
engagement. Compared to non-longtermists in the general population, individuals identified as
longtermists through high scores on the LBS display stronger support for pro-environmental
public policies in general and initiatives advocating climate justice for future generations and
present-day minoritized groups more specifically (Law, Syropoulos, & Young, 2023a). They
additionally report heightened threat perceptions of issues related to climate change, participate
in more pro-climate actions in their daily lives, and contribute larger donations to pro-
environmental causes in the laboratory (Syropoulos, Law, Kraft-Todd, et al., 2023; Syropoulos,
Law, & Young, 2023d). Similar to how they extend moral regard across social and temporal
boundaries, longtermists extend greater moral consideration to entities within the natural
environment as well, including non-human animals, rainforests, and coral reefs (Law,
Syropoulos, Coleman, et al., 2023; Syropoulos, Law, & Young, 2023a), providing further support
for the connection between substantial levels of intergenerational concern and pro-
environmentalism.
The pro-environmental tendencies of longtermists are, in part, explained by their
increased ability to envision a more sustainable future and generate a greater variety of
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 7
environmental alternatives compared to non-longtermists (Law, Syropoulos, & Young, 2023a).
These factors are closely linked to pro-environmental engagement in the broader population as
well (Badaan et al., 2020; Fernando et al., 2018; Wright et al., 2020, 2022). These findings may
reflect a heightened imaginative capacity in longtermists to transcend the here and now and more
vividly represent distal futures in the mind’s eye (see episodic future-thinking; Addis, 2020; Bo
O’Connor & Fowler, 2023; Schacter & Addis, 2020; Tamir & Mitchell, 2011). Moreover,
longtermists exhibit elevated concerns about their own futures, specifically with regard to
leaving behind a positive legacy (Law, Syropoulos, Coleman, et al., 2023; Law, Syropoulos, &
Young, 2023a; Syropoulos, Law, Kraft-Todd, et al., 2023; Syropoulos, Law, & Young, 2023b),
another factor long recognized as a crucial motivator for environmental action (Bang et al., 2017;
Grolleau et al., 2021; Hurlstone et al., 2020; Syropoulos & Markowitz, 2021; Wickersham et al.,
2020; Zaval et al., 2015).
However, despite extensive research examining the connection between intergenerational
concern and climate-related attitudes and actions, a crucial and unanswered question remains: Do
individuals with substantial levels of intergenerational concern cope with and emotionally react
differently from members of the general population to escalating threats associated with climate
change? The theoretical foundations underlying and emerging research into the psychology of
longtermism hints at this possibility. For instance, longtermists actively take actions in their lives
to (1) combat climate related threats (Law, Syropoulos, & Young, 2023a; Syropoulos, Law, &
Young, 2023b) and (2) safeguard the welfare of future generations (Law, Syropoulos, Coleman,
et al., 2023; Law, Syropoulos, & Young, 2023a; Syropoulos, Law, Kraft-Todd, et al., 2023;
Syropoulos, Law, & Young, 2023a, 2023d, 2023b). These findings allude to the possibility that
longtermists may employ more proactive rather than avoidant coping strategies when dealing
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 8
with climate change-related distress, taking practical steps to manage and mitigate the source of
their concerns (Beever et al., 2017; Fuller et al., 2010; Mah et al., 2020; Ojala, 2012).
Likewise, longtermists’ elevated pro-environmental engagement may be owed in part to
their emotional reactions to climate change. For instance, it’s plausible that longtermists may
encounter heightened negative emotions such as anxiety, anger, or guilt (see Marczak, Wierzba,
Kossowski, et al., 2023; Marczak, Wierzba, Zaremba, et al., 2023), when faced with climate-
related challenges and when reflecting on the legacies they will leave behind. These negative
emotions, in turn, could serve as a driving force behind their proactive engagement and action-
oriented approach to addressing climate-related issues. Yet, longtermists also have the capacity
for elevated optimism when looking towards the future, as evidenced by their ability to envision
more sustainable environmental alternatives (Law, Syropoulos, & Young, 2023b). This
observation could provide insight into why potentially negative emotional responses to climate
change do not lead to hopelessness or avoidance, but instead drive action among individuals with
substantial levels of intergenerational concern. Nonetheless, since a comprehensive study
directly comparing the climate change-related coping mechanisms and emotional responses of
longtermists with those of the general population has not yet been conducted, these questions
remain unanswered and warrant investigation. The extensive body of literature on coping
strategies and emotional reactions in the context of climate change serves to supplement what is
known from the burgeoning literature on intergenerational concern and longtermism beliefs in
guiding the present research.
Coping with and Emotional Reactions to Climate Change
Coping refers to the different behavioral and cognitive strategies people use to deal with
stress (Folkman & Moskowitz, 2004). When we refer to coping with climate change, we are
referring to the ways that people who feel worried about climate change respond to those
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 9
feelings – whether they ignore the problem, express denial, and discount the threat (avoidant
coping) or try to find ways to tackle the problem and directly engage with the issue (active
coping). While we can broadly categorize coping strategies as being avoidant or active,
researchers also describe coping based on its focus (e.g., meaning-focused, problem-focused,
emotion-focused, (Folkman & Moskowitz, 2004). When we consider the stressors associated
with climate change and the scale of the issue, it has been argued that successful coping will
likely include a mix of strategies (Doherty & Clayton, 2011) – some strategies involving
proenvironmental engagement, and some that help people to cope with their own emotional
responses to the existential threat of climate change. For example, Ojala (2012) found that,
among youth, engaging in problem-focused active coping was associated with greater negative
affect, but this relationship was attenuated when the youth also engaged in meaning-focused
coping (e.g., positive reframing). The ways that people choose to cope with the threat of climate
change have important implications for their own well-being and the environment. While it is
important for people to find ways to manage their emotional responses to climate change, it is
also necessary for people to take the actions that they can to address climate change through their
own behavior (Doherty & Clayton, 2011).
While work on the link between coping strategies to proenvironmental behavior is sparse,
there is some evidence that people who report coping actively with climate change also report
greater engagement with proenvironmental behaviors. However, past work has also found that
people who report using more avoidant strategies also engage in proenvironmental behaviors. As
long as people are saying they are coping in some form, greater concern translates to behavior
(masked for review). Ojala (2013) found that adolescents who report greater meaning-focused
coping are more likely to report greater pro-environmental behavior, and that those who reported
more de-emphasizing coping (e.g., telling themselves the problem is over-exaggerated) were
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 10
significantly less likely to report proenvironmental engagement. Although more research is
needed on the link between coping and proenvironmental behavior, particularly work measuring
proenvironmental behavior via observation, it seems likely that people who report greater coping
with climate change, especially in more approach-oriented ways, are more likely to engage in
proenvironmental behavior as a means managing their stress.
For longtermists, we might expect that concern about climate change, combined with
propensity for prosociality, may lead to active forms of coping. Longtermists, namely,
individuals who are exceptional in their intergenerational concern, feel a sense of responsibility
to future generations; thus, we would expect that avoidant forms of coping, like denial or
disengagement with the issue, would be contrary to their values. In previous work, people who
express greater concern for their legacy–having an impact on the future beyond their lifespan–
tended to report greater engagement in active forms of coping with climate change, and more
proenvironmental behavior (masked for review). These findings would lend support to a
prediction that longtermists would be more likely to engage in active coping with climate
change-related stress, because longtermists strongly endorse legacy motives (Law, Syropoulos,
Coleman, et al., 2023; Law, Syropoulos, & Young, 2023a; Syropoulos, Law, Kraft-Todd, et al.,
2023; Syropoulos, Law, & Young, 2023b).
Another aspect of longtermism is the ability to generate environmental cognitive
alternatives (ECAs). Having a sense of hope and optimism about the future and being able to
imagine the possibility of humankind adapting to climate change is likely necessary to maintain
long-term engagement with the issue of climate change and also to maintain personal well-being
(Syropoulos, Mah & Markowitz, 2023). Indeed, being able to make meaning in spite of the
magnitude of climate change challenges attenuates the negative relationship between problem-
focused coping and well-being (Ojala, 2013). People who express greater motivation to leave a
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 11
positive legacy also report a greater sense of constructive hope about climate change, and less
hope based in denial (masked for review). Thus, we would expect that, because they feel a
greater sense of hope and less powerlessness, longtermists will be better able to generate ECAs
than controls. It is likely also the case that people who are better able to imagine an alternative
future in turn feel more power to achieve that future and thus feel greater hope.
Finally, the stress and concern that people feel about climate change may take different
forms: grief, anger, guilt and worry. While some level of emotional response is likely needed to
motivate engagement with climate change, there is also evidence that, if these emotions are too
strong, it could be maladaptive (Feather & Williams, 2022). For example, eco-anxiety is
associated with more pro-environmental behavior, but poorer mental health (Ogunbode et al.,
2022). Anger often motivates collective action generally (van Zomeren et al., 2004), and this has
also been found when measuring eco-anger (Stanley et al., 2021). There are many different kinds
of guilt a person can feel associated with climate change (e.g., a sense of collective guilt due to
feeling complicit in a system that causes climate change vs. criticism of one’s actions, Ágoston et
al., 2022). Inducing guilt about climate change can motivate action (Rees et al., 2015). However,
it has been theorized that, for certain people, feelings of guilt underlie a propensity to deny
human-caused climate change (Wong-Parodi & Feygina, 2020). Longtermists may feel both
more anger about climate change–a perceived failure to safeguard the future–and more guilt
from feeling complicit in the systems which cause climate change.
Moreover, sadness about climate change, sometimes termed ecological grief, takes many
forms (Cunsolo & Ellis, 2018). One form of this grief is associated with concerns about
anticipated losses, those that have not yet occurred but that are likely to without action
(Comtesse et al., 2021; Cunsolo & Ellis, 2018). For longtermists, it is likely that one of the
feelings they have about climate change is a sense of loss and grief for the future, as long as they
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 12
believe it poses tangible existential risk. While we might expect that feelings of sadness and
depression around climate change could lead to withdrawal from or avoidance of the issue, some
research suggests that people who express greater eco-depression also engage in collective action
around climate change (Stanley et al., 2021). One of the objectives of the present investigation is
to better understand to what extent longtermists express each of these kinds of emotions.
Current Studies
Building upon the aforementioned theoretical rationale and existing findings (Law,
Syropoulos, Coleman, et al., 2023; Law, Syropoulos, & Young, 2023a; Syropoulos, Law, Kraft-
Todd, et al., 2023; Syropoulos, Law, & Young, 2023a, 2023d, 2023b), we hypothesize first and
foremost, that longtermists will report significantly higher legacy concerns (H1), and a greater
ability to generate environmental cognitive alternatives (H2), compared to non-longtermists in
the general population. In addition, we hypothesize that, because climate change is itself an
extinction risk, longtermists will feel more angry about inaction for climate change (H3a), less
climate contempt–feelings of disregard for the issue of climate change (H3b), more
hope/enthusiasm that climate change can be addressed (H3c), less powerlessness about the scope
of the threat (H3d), more guilt about not doing enough to address climate change (H3e), as well
as more anxiety resulting from (H3f), and sorrow regarding (H3g) climate change.
Importantly, we have varied predictions regarding how longtermists versus general
population controls will score on how isolated they feel from others regarding their opinion
about climate change. On the one hand, it’s possible that longtermists may, on account of climate
change representing an extinction threat, perceive their care regarding climate change as being
higher than average, and consequently feel greater isolation. On the other hand, longtermists may
overestimate normative alignment with their own climate change attitudes and feel less isolation
compared to general population controls as a result.
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 13
Finally, because longtermists are more concerned about and more likely to take active
steps to address climate change (Law, Syropoulos, & Young, 2023a; Syropoulos, Law, & Young,
2023b), and because they seek to protect future generations (Law, Syropoulos, Coleman, et al.,
2023; Law, Syropoulos, & Young, 2023a; Syropoulos, Law, Kraft-Todd, et al., 2023; Syropoulos,
Law, & Young, 2023a, 2023d, 2023b), we hypothesize that they will score higher on problem-
focused (H3h) and meaning-focused (H3i) coping and lower on avoidant coping with climate
change (H3j).
Extending this hypothesis further, we expect that higher scores in legacy concerns and
ability to generate environmental cognitive alternatives will relate to more climate change-
related anger (H4a-H4b), less contempt (H5a-H5b), more climate hope/enthusiasm (H6a-H6b),
less climate powerlessness (H7a-H7b), more climate guilt (H8a-H8b), more climate anxiety
(H9a-H9b), more problem-focused coping (H10a-H10b), more meaning-focused coping (H11a-
H11b), and less avoidant-coping (H12a-H12b). Finally, because of H1-H12, we also expect
significant indirect effects of longtermism matching the aforementioned directional associations
on climate emotions via higher legacy concerns and environmental cognitive alternatives as
simultaneous mediators (H13). These hypotheses, together with all analytical decisions, were
code for all analyses can be found on the Open Science Framework,
Method
Participants
A total of 800 participants were recruited via Prolific, an online platform that allows
participants to complete surveys in exchange for financial remuneration. Per our pre-registration
protocol we removed participants who had duplicate IP addresses (N = 12) and participants who
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 14
missed our attention check (a multiple choice question asking them to select a particular
response; N = 17). A total of 771 participants remained (M = 40.51, SD = 13.45), of whom
age age
385 (49.9%) were male, 369 (47.9%) female, 17 (2.2%) neither male nor female, 565 (73.2%)
white, 116 (15.0%) Black or African American, and 38 (4.9%) Asian.
Materials and Procedure
Measures were grouped based on their role (predictor, mediators, outcomes) and shown
to participants in a randomized order.
Predictor: Longtermism Beliefs
Longtermism beliefs were captured with the 28-item (a = 0.97) Longtermism Beliefs
Scale (Syropoulos, Law, Kraft-Todd, et al., 2023). The scale consists of seven statements, which
are repeated with reference to four different timeframes/timepoints (1,000, 10,000, 100,000, and
1,000,000 years in the future). Scores are captured on slider scales ranging from 0 = strongly
disagree – 100 = strongly agree. Per the proposed methodology, participants are classified as
longtermists if they score above 75 for the closest temporal timeframe (1,000 years), and they
have the same score, or higher for future timeframes (i.e., 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000 years
in the future).
Mediator: Legacy Concerns
Legacy concerns were captured using three items from Zaval et al. (2015), measured on
7-point Likert scale (a = 0.89).
Mediator: Environmental Cognitive Alternatives
Environmental cognitive alternatives (ECAS) were captured with 10 items (a = 0.93)
from Wright et al. (2020) measured a 7-point Likert scale.
Outcome: Climate Change Coping
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 15
Three different methods of coping with climate change were measured. These were
problem-focused coping (a = 0.90), meaning-focused coping (a = 0.79), and avoidant coping (a
= 0.87). These measures were taken directly or adapted from Ojala (2012). Each method of
coping was measured with 5 items, each measured on a 7-point Likert scale.
Outcome: Climate Change Emotions
In a recent paper, researchers created a comprehensive tool for assessing emotional
reactions to climate change (see Marczak et al., 2023). We used this measure, which measured
each climate change-related emotion with four items on a 7-point Likert scale. The emotions we
included in our study were: anger (a = 0.96) contempt (a = 0.94), hope/enthusiasm (a = 0.93),
powerlessness (a = 0.84), guilt (a = 0.95), anxiety (a = 0.92), sorrow (a = 0.95), and isolation (a
= 0.91).
Results
Correlations
As hypothesized higher longtermism beliefs related to increased legacy concerns and
ECAs. Each of these three measures related to decreased avoidant coping, increased problem-
focused and meaning-based coping with climate change. Coping styles that were actively
acknowledging climate change and focused on ways to address the issue rather than avoid it,
Longtermism beliefs, legacy concerns and ECAs related to increased hope, anger, guilt, anxiety,
sorrow, isolation and decreased contempt. No significant association was found with
powerlessness except for ECAs, which negatively related to powerlessness.

high intergenerational concern. Specifically, longtermists (M = 92.78, SD = 6.34) scored
significantly higher (t(761.73) = 41.89, p < .001, d = 2.63) than the rest of the sample (M =
48.87, SD = 22.73) in longtermism beliefs, suggesting that they were considerably higher in their
perception that future people deserve moral rights and that we can influence their lives. All
results were robust to the inclusion of age, gender, socioeconomic status and political ideology as
covariates (i.e., results remained significant and in the same direction). For these analyses, see
the Supplementary Online Materials (SOM).

Climate Change Emotions
Supporting our hypothesis, longtermists scored significantly higher in anger, guilt,
anxiety and sorrow, but importantly, they also reported significantly higher hope about climate
change than non-longtermists. Further, they expressed significantly less contempt. Contrary to
our hypothesis, no significant difference was noted for powerlessness. For isolation, we had
contrasting hypotheses. The results suggested that longtermists felt more isolation compared to
controls, possibly due their elevated concern for the issue relative to the rest of the population

Indirect Effects
Based on the aforementioned theoretical rationale, and our pre-registered expectation for
a significant indirect effect of longtermism on the different coping methods and emotional
reactions to climate change, we estimated several indirect effects with longtermist identification
as the predictor (binary variable; 1 = longtermist, 0 = non-longtermist), legacy concerns and
ECAS as parallel mediators, and each outcome of interest as the focal outcome in each model.
We used the PROCESS Macros (Hayes, 2013), Model 4 (mediation with parallel mediators),
with 10,000 bootstrapped samples.
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 21
In all models, longtermist identification predicted significantly higher legacy concerns (b
= 0.72, 95% C.I. [.50, .94], R2 = .05) and ECAS (b = 0.60, 95% C.I. [.38, .82], R2 = .04). Even
after controlling for legacy concerns and ECAS, being a longtermist predicted significantly
higher scores for problem-focused coping, anger, guilt, sorrow, and anxiety for climate change,
and significantly lower scores for contempt and avoidant coping, suggesting that legacy concerns
and ECAS only partially mediate the effect of longtermism for these outcomes. However, for
meaning-based coping and hope, the effect of longtermism was not significant after including the
mediators. In turn, higher legacy concerns and ECAS related to increased problem-focused and
meaning-based coping, hope, guilt, anger, isolation, anxiety, and sorrow, while ECAS
specifically also related to decreased avoidant coping, and contempt. For powerlessness, legacy
concerns had a positive association while ECAs a negative. Finally, significant indirect effects
for both legacy concerns and ECAS emerged for problem-focused and meaning-based coping,
anger, hope, powerlessness, guilt, isolation, anxiety, and sorrow. ECAS also mediated the effect
of longtermism for avoidant coping and contempt. Results were for the most part consistent after
accounting for the aforementioned demographic covariates, as all indirect effects except for the
S3 in SOM).

Discussion
As climate change-related threats become more pronounced (Horton, 2023; IPCC, 2023;
Paddison, 2023; Sally Younger, 2023), researchers are now extending their focus beyond the
physical environment to examine their impact on the mental health of individuals within it
(Beever et al., 2017; Fuller et al., 2010; Mah et al., 2020; Marczak, Wierzba, Zaremba, et al.,
2023; Ojala, 2012; Ostrom, 2009; Shrum et al., 2023). This research highlights not only that
climate change impacts mental health, but that resulting coping strategies and emotional
reactions are a critical driver of pro-environmental engagement. Despite extensive research
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 23
demonstrating that intergenerational concern, as assessed by high scores on the Longtermism
Beliefs Scale (LBS; Syropoulos, Law, Kraft-Todd, et al., 2023), correlates with pro-
environmental engagement (Law, Syropoulos, & Young, 2023b; Syropoulos, Law, & Young,
2023d) and forward-thinking attitudes and behaviors aimed at safeguarding the well-being of
future generations (Law, Syropoulos, Coleman, et al., 2023; Law, Syropoulos, & Young, 2023a;
Syropoulos, Law, Kraft-Todd, et al., 2023; Syropoulos, Law, & Young, 2023a, 2023d, 2023b),
the precise impact of intergenerational concern on coping strategies and emotional reactions to
climate change remains a critically unexplored area of study (see Syropoulos, Mah & Markowitz
2023). The present study represents a first pass at testing the novel hypothesis that
intergenerational concern serves the adaptive function of not only promoting attitudes and
actions towards mitigating the deleterious effects of climate change on the natural environment,
but also promoting proactive coping strategies towards mitigating its adverse effects on
psychological well-being.
In this study, we delved into the climate change-related coping strategies (Beever et al.,
2017; Fuller et al., 2010; Mah et al., 2020; Ojala, 2012) and emotional reactions (Marczak,
Wierzba, Kossowski, et al., 2023; Marczak, Wierzba, Zaremba, et al., 2023) of empirically-
identified longtermists, individuals who exhibit exceptionally strong intergenerational concern.
Our findings revealed that longtermists tend to employ problem-focused (i.e., directing one’s
effort and attention directly toward actively addressing the specific problem or stressor they are
facing) and meaning-based (i.e., finding or creating meaning and purpose in difficult or
challenging situations) coping strategies more frequently while relying less on avoidant coping
strategies (i.e., engaging in efforts to distance oneself from a stressor) when confronted with
climate change-related challenges. Intriguingly, despite experiencing emotions such as guilt,
anger, sorrow, and a sense of isolation in response to climate change, longtermists also reported
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 24
feeling a distinct sense of hope about the future, aligning with work which underscores the utility
of emotional complexity in driving collective action (Bou Zeineddine & Leach, 2021).
The emotional responses we observed were in line with what we would expect for a
group of people characterized by robust concern for the distant future. Having feelings about
climate change (regardless of the valence) is indicative of involvement with the issue rather than
avoidance. Longtermists care about the issue of climate change, and that care and concern
manifest in their emotional engagement. While previous research has suggested that there is a
level of emotional response needed to motivate action, experiencing worry too strongly could
result in avoidance (Feather & Williams, 2022). Yet, even among those who are experiencing
strong negative emotions, maintaining a sense of hope and being able to make meaning represent
one way of safeguarding well-being (Ojala, 2013). Longtermists appear to be especially good at
maintaining hope. However, understanding how and why longtermists foster hope, and the
intricate relationships between different emotions over time requires further study.
These observed patterns in coping and emotional responses were further elucidated by
two key factors. First, longtermists’ heightened concerns about the legacy they will leave behind
played a crucial role in driving their problem-focused and meaning-based coping strategies.
These findings align with an extensive body of literature linking legacy motivations to
proenvironmental attitudes and action (Bang et al., 2017; Grolleau et al., 2021, 2021; Hurlstone
et al., 2014, 2020; Syropoulos et al., 2023; Syropoulos & Markowitz, 2021; Wickersham et al.,
2020; Zaval et al., 2015) as well as intergenerational concern (Law, Syropoulos, Coleman, et al.,
2023; Law, Syropoulos, & Young, 2023a; Syropoulos, Law, Kraft-Todd, et al., 2023; Syropoulos,
Law, & Young, 2023b). Yet the present findings build upon this existing literature by
demonstrating that legacy motivations simultaneously mitigate the impact of climate change on
well-being. Second, longtermists’ enhanced ability to generate alternative solutions and
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 25
perspectives regarding environmental issues, referred to as environmental cognitive alternatives
(ECAs), contributed significantly to their positive outlook and adaptive coping mechanisms in
the face of climate change. Similar to legacy motivations, ECAs have been shown to predict pro-
environmental and otherwise farsighted attitudes and actions (Wright et al., 2020, 2022).
Nonetheless, the present study is the first to connect this factor to climate-related coping and
emotionality.
In summary, the present findings show that individuals with a strong sense of
intergenerational concern experience a mix of emotions when it comes to climate change. They
often grapple with feelings of anger, guilt, and anxiety in response to the climate crisis. However,
in contrast to these negative emotions, they also maintain a sense of hope about the future, taking
direct actions to address the challenges posed by climate change (problem-focused coping),
actively engaging with the issue and seeking solutions. Simultaneously, they find meaning and
purpose in their efforts, not losing faith in others or humanity as a whole (meaning-focused
coping). Importantly, they do not resort to avoidant coping, which involves avoiding or ignoring
the issue altogether. Instead, they confront climate change head-on, driven by their ability to
envision of a more sustainable future and strong desire to leave behind a positive and lasting
legacy. By instilling values that highlight intergenerational concern as a key priority, we may be
able not only to increase pro-climate action, but also to help individuals actively and
constructively cope with changes produced by climate change.
Limitations and Future Directions
While the current study represents an initial exploration of the positive relationship that
intergenerational concern has with climate-related coping and emotional responses, it is
important to acknowledge several limitations and areas that warrant further investigation and
exploration. For instance, the analyses in the current study are correlational, which means that
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 26
the directionality and causal nature of the relationships under examination remain subject to
further investigation. On the one hand, it is possible that intergenerational concern precedes and
influences coping strategies and emotional responses to climate change. It is equally plausible
that individuals’ coping mechanisms and emotional reactions to climate challenges may, in turn,
shape the level of concern they feel toward safeguarding future generations from these threats.
These potential causal relationships should be explored in future research that directly
manipulates intergenerational concern. Previous research has demonstrated that low-cost and
short-duration interventions can effectively promote intergenerational attitudes and actions
(Grolleau et al., 2021; Hurlstone et al., 2020; Syropoulos, Law, & Young, 2023b, 2023d).
Furthermore, future research could consider applying the current framework within a
longitudinal context. Given that coping mechanisms are designed to alleviate negative emotional
states, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the proactive coping strategies used by individuals
with heightened intergenerational concern might effectively mitigate the feelings of anger, guilt,
and anxiety they experience in response to climate challenges over time. Longitudinal studies
could provide valuable insights into the evolving dynamics of coping and emotional reactions in
relation to climate change. Notably, while this study has shed light on the connections between
intergenerational concern, coping strategies, and emotional responses, it has yet to establish a
direct link between coping mechanisms and climate actions. Future research endeavors may
bridge this gap by investigating how specific coping strategies translate into concrete pro-
environmental behaviors and actions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the
interplay between emotional reactions, coping, and climate-related engagement.
Another area ripe for further investigation is the variance that persists between
intergenerational concern and the outcomes. While our study has uncovered evidence suggesting
that legacy concerns and environmental cognitive alternatives (ECAs) account for a portion of
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 27
the variance in these relationships, there remains unexplained variance that calls for deeper
exploration. Future research can explore additional factors and mechanisms that contribute to the
complex relationship between intergenerational concern and outcomes related to coping and
emotional reactions, offering a more comprehensive understanding of these dynamics.
As an example, longtermists exhibit heightened levels of future self-continuity, indicating
a strong sense of identity with their future selves, and tend to carefully contemplate the
consequences of their actions (Syropoulos et al., 2023). These variables are well-established
predictors of forward-thinking behaviors aimed at safeguarding not only one’s own future but
also the future well-being of others (Azizli et al., 2015; Blouin-Hudon & Pychyl, 2017; Faralla et
al., 2021; Gasiorek, 2022; Hershfield, 2011; J. Joireman et al., 2005; J. A. Joireman, 1999;
Murphy & Dockray, 2018; Sirois, 2004; Sokol & Serper, 2020; Strathman et al., 1994, 1994).
Moreover, longtermists engage in greater utopian thinking, and report a greater vividness when
envisioning the distant future compared to general population controls, characteristics that
contribute to intergenerational and pro-environmental concerns (Badaan et al., 2020; Bo
O’Connor & Fowler, 2023; Fernando et al., 2018; Law, Syropoulos, Coleman, et al., 2023; Law,
Syropoulos, & Young, 2023b; Schacter & Addis, 2020). Given the relevance of these additional
factors, they merit consideration as candidate mechanisms that could help bridge the gap
between intergenerational concern and coping strategies, as well as emotional reactions in the
context of climate change.
Lastly, it’s essential to acknowledge that the current study is based on a sample from the
United States. Future research endeavors should aim to replicate and extend the findings
presented here in an international context. Examining these relationships across diverse cultural
and geographic settings may help uncover valuable insights into the universality or cultural
specificity of the observed patterns, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of
LONGTERMISM, AND CONSTRUCTIVE COPING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 28
intergenerational concern and its implications for climate-related coping and emotional responses
on a global scale. For instance, prior research has found that countries with cultures embodying a
long-term orientation and with greater intergenerational solidarity score higher on numerous
metrics of environmental performance (Syropoulos, Law, & Young, 2023c). Moreover, citizens
of these countries are more concerned about the negative effects of climate change. What stands
to be addressed in future research is whether national differences in temporal perspective predict
variation in coping with and emotional reactions to climate change, in turn facilitating greater
proenvironmental engagement.
Conclusion
Climate change impacts are already occurring but will be catastrophic for future
generations without intervention. Longtermists, and those with high levels of intergenerational
concern more broadly, represent a group of people who are particularly concerned about future
generations. This intergenerational concern does not appear to paralyze them or prevent
engagement with the issue; in fact, we find that longtermists are able to feel hopeful in spite of
the challenges and engage in proactive coping strategies to address climate change.
