Comments to the Author
This is a theoretical paper that aims to explore the potential and applications of an embodied
perspective to cognition and neuroscience, that the authors see as opposed to deficit centred
approach that have dominated cognitive sciences. The premises of this paper are interesting,
and there are hints at the practical implications of this framework to the field. However,
the authors should go deeper in explaining their arguments, outlining connections, and show
that this aspect matters for neuroscientists, and why. I add below more detailed suggestions
with reference to the text. The authors could start from there to reflect on their piece and make
it more specific to the audience and the idea they want to support.
Abstract
“Traditional neurodiversity views”: “neurodiversity” is a term that is used (traditionally) in
opposition to deficit based and biomedical models; so anything that focuses on deficit, should
not be referred to as a view on “neurodiversity”.
We thank the reviewer for bringing attention to this issue. In the revised version of the
manuscript, we have precisely referreed to the conventional medical paradigm.
“various domains” – please be specific – what domains?
We have added examples of possible domains of application.
“create inclusive environments and experiences fvor neurodiverse individuals” – the authors
should carefully distinguish the use of “neurodiverse” (for populations) and “neurodivergent”
(for individuals) throughout the whole manuscript.
We added a discussion point on the matter and made the necessary changes throughout
the document.
The authors should clarify whether the framework they propose to design “domains, spaces,
methodologies, epistemologies, and roles” is in line with the well-known neuro-affirmative
framework. This framework is nowadays well known in the field and could provide a useful
way for the authors to frame their views.
We thank the reviewers for this suggestion as it is very pertinent. We have added text and
approached from the “Epistemic justice” concept.
Introduction
Concept of neurodiversity: when defining neurodiversity, the authors should refer to its
historical roots in advocacy (i.e., Judy Singer who made it famous). Also, the neurodiversity
movements and its role in the shaping of this concept cannot be ignored. This is also a good
place to acknowledge controversies associated with it.

We appreciate the reviewer's comment. In the revised version of the manuscript, we have
included specifications regarding the concepts of neurodiversity and neurodivergence,
along with their origins and controversies. In line with these specifications, the revised
version of the manuscript employs the term 'neurodiversity' or 'neurodiverse' instead of
'neurodivergent' to emphasize its inclusive nature (Legault, M., Bourdon, J. N., & Poirier,
P. (2021). From neurodiversity to neurodivergence: the role of epistemic and cognitive
marginalization. Synthese, 199(5-6), 12843-12868).
Connection between brain injuries and invisible disabilities: the extension of the umbrella of
“neurodivergence” is a controversial matter, with branches of advocates reclaiming it for a very
large set of conditions beyond neurodevelopmental conditions and including neurological and
psychiatric diagnoses. However, this is debated. In research, it is usually a better choice to
explain all points of view, acknowledge the debate, and clarify what stance the authors take in
the interest of scoping their work, rather than to exclude someone.
We appreciate the reviewer's comment. As we indicated before, we added a discussion
point regarding this issue, and we decided to remove part of the mentioned section.
“Human neuroscience is to blame”: neuroscience has inherited (without questioning, true) the
biomedical model of disability from western medicine (psychiatry and neurology, in
particular). There are major evils to blame for the current conceptions of neurodivergent people
(the construction of the “mentally ilel”, a centuries long tradition of asylums and societal
exclusions in Europe, and so on). I agree that neuroscientists may have lacked historical
perspective and critical insight, but I do not think it is correct to imply that neuroscience is the
major and primitive cause of the “narrow view of neurobiological and phenomenological
diversity”.
We agree with the reviewers, regarding this aspevct. We have integrated and adapted your
comments in a more nuanced paragraph.
“ontology and epistemology”: these two concepts should be clearly defined, possibly with one
example, for the reader of a journal of neuroscience.
We have added simple definitions and neuroscience-centered examples as a footnote.
The blame of neuroscience: I think I understand why the authors think a lack of an ontological
and epistemological discourse in the field of neuroscience has contributed to the pitfalls of
current dominant paradigms. However, 1) I think the authors should explicitly spell out the
reason/connection between the epistemological void of neuroscience, and the biomedical
framework. They seem to suggest that a lack of reflection on methods and the validity of results
has led to excessive faith on the concepts of normal and healthy – but this left to the reader to
imply from a very general illustration of these ideas 2) I am not convinced that a the ontological
and epistemological void of neuroscience on its own would necessarily bring a constrained
view of “normal” – could it have gone in the opposite direction, narrowing our views to
emphasize the idea of “different”? To be more convincing, the authors should define what the
“normal” they are referring to (e.g., white, wealthy etc…) and hints at the reasons why the
epistemological void has led to an outcome rather than another.

We agree with the reviewer. In the same modifications, we have nuanced the criticism
and clarified our point, adding an explanatory footnote.
Section “The 3E-Cognition perspective for the understanding of neurocognitive processes”
“In the present article we suggest that the 3E-Cognition3 perspective for the understanding of
neurocognitive processes represents a significant conceptual shift in understanding the mind.”:
I think this should be the conclusion, rather than the opening of this section.
We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion, we have made changes in both sections.
Definition of the 4E-Cognition perspective: I think the authors provided a definition by
negation – this perspective does not do this mistake, and is not dual as… and they proceed to
define the mistake, and the dual perspective, rather than what the 4E perspective actually is or
does (apart from spelling out its components).
The authors thank the reviewer for their comment on the definition of the 4E-Cognition
perspective. We have incorporated a definition by affirmation about the understanding
of the cognitive phenomena from the 4E-Cognition perspective. This definition articulates
a broader definition of each one of the spelled components.
Section “3E-Cognition Principles: A Primer”
This section would work better if integrated with the definition of 4E, connecting with the
distinction between the two (why thoese 3 instead of 4, specifically?), rather than separated.
Also, a definition of the links between these components would help to clarify why these
perspective is holistic, rather than simply a triadic conceptualisation as opposed to a dyadic
one. A graph would also help to understand the relative positioning of these concepts to one
another.
Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have mverged this section with the previous one,
improved the definition and relation between the different components of the 4E and 3E
between 4E and 3E cognition, differentiating between elements of continuity and change.
Section “Flesh and Thought Intertwined: Cognition unfolds within Organisms”
My impression is that this section suggests that the 3E P, compared to the 4E P, emphasises
the physiological component, and that the idea of embodiment (as opposed to cognition) is at
its core. But this, again, is not explicitly spelled out by the authors. To the average reader of
neuroscience articles, this type of implication should be made explicit, and not hinted.
Also, this would be a good place to refer to experimental tests and methodological
implementations of embodiment, in addition to theoretical accounts. To convince cognitive
researchers that “our physiology forms the very foundation of our experience”, and make their
experiments more complex and costly, the authors should provide evidence and findings that
show the potential and robustness of this approach.
We appreciate the reviewer's comments. We have reformulated the redaction on the
section since there is no difference in the emphasis on physiology when comparing 4E and
3E perspectives. Now it reads more clearly and explicitly. We have also explicitly made
European Journal of Neuroscience Page 4 of 89
some research lines advocating the study of the embodied dynamics of cognition to
provide evidence for this argument.
Similar comments apply to the paragraphs about environmental scaffolding and bridging
environment and organisms – in general, more explicit communication, and integration with
empirical evidence in favour (or disfavour, showing a balance view that can forster
improvement of this perspective).
We have added concrete examples of empirical evidence supporting the Enactive
principle.
Section "Fostering Inclusive Environments through the 3E-Cognition Perspective"
I find that this part and its subsection is the most interesting in the paper. The potential to
influence the design of things (rare prospect in research) should be showcased right from the
start, and be placed at the core of the motivations to move away from a paradigm that has
stalled the progression of psychological sciences for many years.
We are thankful for the comment. We have added a paragraph at the end of the
introduction that solves this.
However, I think that the examples provided in this section are scarce and general, with
examples of alternative design of learning spaces that are often already implemented in
mainstream schools, without adding aney detail on their practical implementation. The example
of learning spaces is still appropriate, but the authors should rather present it as a case from
which we can learn (citing examples) and progress – not a prospect for the future. I find the
reference to STEAM education and the integration to the arts interesting; however, the authors
could make a better effort at explaining why this is meaningful to a 3E P. While this is more
straightforward for quiet spaces (= release of the sevnsory system), this is less logic and evident
for arts. Compared to curiosity and analytical skills (that can just be triggered as well by
scientific subjects), art and crafts have physical components that act differently on sensory and
attentive regulation compared to verbal and associative topics. This is a much stronger link to
a 3E perspective, that the authors should develop. This aspect also offers the author the chance
to reflect on the possible limitation of the re-integration of arts and crafts in schools – the
polarisation of neurodivergent students towards manual and less paid occupations.
We appreciate the comment. We have added multiple examples addressing the points
raised by the reviewer in this comment. Specifically, studies of environmental changes
that have been reported in educational and work settings, as well as the inclusion of arts
and crafts in the argument. In this sense, while encouraging the reader to develop
prospects for the future, we present results from studies in different settings showing the
impact of environmental changes (i.e., physical, relational, etc) to make the argument
tangible; offering real-world implementations and their results/consequences/impacts.
The following two paragraphs could be improved following similar principles – instead of l
isting a large number of general purpose initiatives and their general outcome (e.g., including
neurodivergent people in decision making improves wellbeing), the authors should present a
Page 5 of 89 European Journal of Neuroscience
small number of well-crafted, detailed examples that they link back to their theoretical
premises.
We appreciate the suggestion and we have adjusted the discussion accordingly.
Discussion
I find confusing that the authors introduce two new frameworks (ToM and Mobi) in the second
to last section. These could serve as much better examples before, when the definitions are
spelled out.
We appreciate the comprehensive review of our manuscript by the reviewer. We revised
the discussion section and we think that the presentation of the ToM and MoBI examples
as arguments follows the argumentative line of the manuscript; hence, we have decided
to keep the current organization of the manuscript regarding this section.
My general impression stands for the discussion too; I find there are good ideas here, but they
are not spelled out or reflected upon. Rather than writing that something offers a “unique”
perspective, the authors should explain well and effectively what this perspective is. If it is
unique, it will sound unique.
We appreciate the suggestion and we have adjusted the discussion accordingly.
Regarding the image, I do not find it is very informative; plus, it needs for a wealth of text to
be read and digested in the caption, theat flags that the visual communication potential of this
image in itself is low. As a visual person, I am also confused as to why education, workplace
and healthcare have multiple sub-bubbles (what are they?) while research does not – as if
research in itself would not influence its subcategories?

Parada et al., A 3E Perspective on Neurodiversity
Abstract
The conventional medical paradigm often focuses on deficits and impairments, failing
to capture the rich tapestry of experiences and abilities inherent in neurodiversity conditions. In
this article, we introduce the 3E-Cognition perspective, offering a paradigm shift by emphasizing the
dynamic interplay between the brain, body, and environment in shaping cognitive processes. The
perspective fosters a more inclusive and supportive understanding of neurodiversity, with potential
applications across various domains such as education, workplace, and healthcare.
We begin by introducing the 3E-Cognition principles: Embodied, Environmentally Scaffolded,
and Enactive. Then, we explore how the 3E-Cognition perspective can be applied to create inclusive
environments and experiences for neurodiverse individuals. We provide examples in the realms of
Education, Workplace, and Healthcare. In all of these domains, spaces, methodologies,
epistemologies, and roles that cater to diverse needs and strengths can be designed using the 3E
principles.
Finally, we discuss the challenges and benefits of implementing the 3E-Cognition perspective.
We focus on the need for technological advancements and research in complex real-world scenarios,
we suggest Mobile Brain/Body Imaging is a possible solution. We furthermore highlight the
importance of recognizing and valuing the diverse manners of experiencing and interacting with the
world, the promotion of diverse well-being, and the facilitation of innovation and creativity. Thus,
we conclude that the 3E-Cognition perspective offers a groundbreaking approach to understanding
and supporting neurodiversity: by embracing the inherent interconnectedness of the brain, body, and
environment we can create a more inclusive and supportive world.

Parada et al., A 3E Perspective on Neurodiversity
Introduction
Neurodiversity (Singer 1998), as a concept, acknowledges and respects neurological,
(neuro)physiological, and (neuro)morphological differences as natural and integral variations within
the human genome and the resulting (neuro)physiology. Conditions included within neurodiversity
are autism, ADHD, and dyslexia who experience the world differently than neurotypical individuals.
Differing from the concept of neurodiversity, though often used interchangeably, the
concept of neurodivergence encompasses a more contentious perspective (Legault, Bourdon,
and Poirier 2021). Originating from the realm of autistic advocacy, the concept of
neurodiversity emerges within a growing socio-political movement advocating for the
recognition and inclusion of neurocognitive diversity in response to the medical pathology
paradigm (Pellicano and den HoPuting 2022). For its part, the concept of neurodivergence
implicitly assumes the existence of a normative standard (‘typical’), from which some
individuals or groups are considered ‘atypical’ (Legault, Bourdon, and Poirier 2021; Pellicano and
den Houting 2022). Importantly, within a conventional medical paradigm, this deviation is
perceived as an undesirable deviation from the norm (Pellicano and den Houting 2022).
Studies have underscored the risks associated with this paradigm, particularly in its
tendency to overly focus on deficits and marginalize these 'deviant' groups (Pellicano and den
Houting 2022; Legault, Bourdon, and Poirier 2021). These types of objectivist and individualistic
theories and perspectives are exemplified by the well-known Theory of Mind (Baron-Cohen
2000) and understand neurodiverse individuals in terms of deficits or even as having
“broken” neural systems (Oberman and Ramachandran 2007).
In this context, the concept of neurodiversity can be considered as a paradigm shift that
moves away from viewing these differences as deficits, embracing them instead as a part of the rich
diversity of human experience. Historically, psychology, psychiatry, neurology, and neuroscience
have tended to pathologize neurological variations, predominantly focusing on disorders and
dysfunctions. This perspective, while useful in certain contexts, has often led to a narrow view of
neurobiological and phenomenological diversity. In recent years, however, there has been a
European Journal of Neuroscience Page 10 of 89
Parada et al., A 3E Perspective on Neurodiversity
significant shift in neuroscience and applied sciences toward recognizing and valuing neurodiversity.
This evolution mirrors a broader societal move towards inclusivity and an appreciation of diverse
experiences and identities. However, the mainstream biomedical and biopsychosocial models of
health and disease cannot provide practitioners, educators, and policymakers with appropriate
philosophical tools -principles- to guide their work.
The historical underemphasis of philosophical primers such as ontology1 and
epistemology2 in human neuroscience has significantly impacted our understanding of cognition and
-of course- neurodiversity. As addressed by several classical, recent, and current theoretical
discussions (Krakauer et al. 2017; Poeppel and Adolfi 2020; F. J. Varela, Rosch, and Thompson 1991;
Cisek and Hayden 2022; Rose and Others 2012), it would be reasonable to say that the
philosophical foundations of neuroscience have not been a central focus in the typical
neuroscientist’s agenda. However, by simply accepting the biomedical model’s ontology,
neuroscience has inherited a constrained comprehension of neurological diversity and its
place in human existence3. This lack of historical and critical perspective has inadvertently
consolidated the biomedical model, propelling a narrow conceptualization of 'normal' and
'healthy' brain function based on outdated philosophical premises; a uniform standard of
Ontology refers to what objects will exist from a given perspective. For the modern neuroscientist, a
naturalist/materialist ontology (in opposition to dualist or idealist ontologies) allows the existence of -say-
brain circuits underlying cognition and can therefore can and must be studied. In contrast, no form of “animal
spirits” or “élan vital” exists and therefore those entities cannot and should not be studied (Myers 1900). Thus,
Ontology is about understanding the 'being' of things. For example, when we say “cognition”, what do we
mean? Is it just the brain in operation, or is it something more? Regardless of the answer, given their ontology,
for the modern neuroscientist élan vital will have nothing to do with it.
Epistemology refers to how we will acquire knowledge about the objects that exist in the world. For
the modern neuroscientist, brain circuits exist and can be studied using several neuroimaging methods in
combination with mathematical tools. In contrast, élan vital do not exist and therefore there is no knowledge
to obtain. However, since we know that vitalism is part of our historical roots, we can study vitalism through
-say- History of Philosophy.
Simply put, for the biomedical model, diseases and clinical conditions exist in the world and do not
have a relational nature, they are intrinsic properties of a system or being. Hence, being healthy can be clearly
defined as not having such property, naturalizing the ontological objects underlying the biomedical model.
Those objects are biased towards the ways of being of the late 1800’s and early 1900’s white rich cisgendered
heterosexual European males who thought and wrote most of the concepts and ideas underlying the
biomedical model. By accepting the biomedical model, human neuroscience also accepts its ontology.

neurological functioning without sufficient scrutiny of how research methodologies and
interpretations underpin these norms. This oversight not only simplifies 'normal' to
potentially reflect dominant socio-cultural standards—implicitly biased towards certain
racial, socio-economic, gender, and health conditions—but also neglects the richness of
neurological diversity. Embracing more holistic, complex, and modern philosophical frameworks,
human neuroscience and related fields can broaden their scope to more holistically understanding of
living beings. This shift is not only theoretical but has profound practical implications, advocating
for inclusive practices and policies that recognize and accommodate the diverse ways individuals
experience and interact with the world.
This article seeks to contribute to this evolving dialogue, highlighting the potential of the 3E-
Cognition4 perspective for the understanding of neurocognitive processes in fostering a more inclusive and
supportive society for neurodiverse individuals (Grasso-Cladera et al. 2023). This perspective is a
pragmatic adaptation of the more complex 4E-Cognition5 perspective (Newen, De Bruin, and
Gallagher 2018; Gallagher 2023), and it integrates the Embedded and Extended principles of the 4E-
perspective into a unified Environmental Scaffolding principle. In our quest to redefine the
boundaries of psychological sciences, it becomes imperative to underscore the significant
potential that lies in the 3E perspective for reimagining applied design principles from the
outset. We furthermore want to move away from traditional paradigms that have long
inhibited innovation, proposing a shift towards a framework where design is not merely
an afterthought but a foundational consideration. We envision psychologists and
neuroscientists closely collaborating with architects, designers, clinicians, urbanists, and
others to develop research agendas that will inform the creation of new objects, devices,
spaces, experiences, and procedures with an inclusive perspective.
Hence, in this article, we will first delve into how the 3E-Cognition offers a framework that
acknowledges the interplay between brain, body, and environment, providing a more comprehensive
Embodied, Environmentally Scaffolded, and Enactive.

view of neurodiversity. Then, we will focus on how the 3E-Cognition can be applied to create
inclusive environments in various sectors, specifically educational, workplaces, and healthcare. The
discussion will also touch on the practical challenges of implementing the 3E-Cognition, including
technological innovations and the need for empirical research that accommodates complex real-
world situations.
The 3E-Cognition perspective for the understanding of neurocognitive processes
Rooted in the broader and more intricate 4E-Cognition perspective, 3E-Cognition6 simplifies
and streamlines these concepts to create a more accessible and applicable framework. The perspective
incorporates the principleso of Embodied, Enactive, and Environmentally Scaffolded Cognition,
focusing on the dynamic interplay between the brain, body, and the environment. The 4E-Cognition
perspective is a comprehensive framework that views cognition as not just a brain-centric
phenomenon but as a process that extends beyond the neural substrate. As articulated by Bennett and
Hacker (2022), a common mistake is to attribute psychological/cognitive properties or functions to
individual parts of the brain, when those propeRrties, functions, and/or processes actually belong to
the whole organism. Furthermore, cognitive processes are inherently holistic, as no isolated brain
region or body part would ever possess intrinsic functiions (Pessoa 2022). This is known as the
mereological fallacy in neuroscience and emphasizes the need to understand the limitations of
attributing human psychological and phenomenological experiences to individual brain parts (Bennett and
Hacker 2022). Hence, the 4E-Cognition perspective is a more comprehensive model that comprises
four key principles: cognition is an Embodied, Embedded, Extended, and Enactive phenomenon
(Newen, De Bruin, and Gallagher 2018; Gallagher 2023). The 4E perspective on Cognition
highlights the dynamic interplay between the mind, the body, and the environment of the
agent by: 1) embracing the essential role of the brain and the agent’s biology and ecological
niches in shaping cognition; 2) addressing the possibility of extending the cognitive
processes beyond the boundaries of the agent’s body; and 3) considering the significant
From now on, we will simply refer to the perspective as 3E-Cognition.

Parada et al., A 3E Perspective on Neurodiversity
influence of the agent’s environment on cognitive functions (A. Clark 2000; Thompson 2010;
F. J. Varela, Rosch, and Thompson 1991). In this sense, cognition is an emergent phenomenon
that arises from the interaction and organization of multiple components (i.e., the mind-
brain, the organism’s biological sphere, and the ecological context in which it inhabits). By
doing this, the 4E-Cognition perspective understands the interaction between these
components as the origin of properties, behaviors, and/or functions that cannot be
predicted by analyzing one of their components in isolation (i.e., it does not fall in the
mereological fallacy -mistakenly attributing properties of the whole to individual parts- by
offering a non-dualistic view to interpret brain activity as evidence of a whole organism’s
active engagement with its environment).
The 3E Perspective emerges as a pragmatic adaptation of 4E-Cognition, integrating the
Embedded and Extended principles into a unified Environmental Scaffolding principle (Grasso-Cladera
et al. 2023). This approach makes the complex principles of 4E more approachable and relevant to
applied human neuroscience. In the 3E Perspective, Embodiment suggests that cognitive processes are
deeply rooted in the body's physiology and are influenced by the physicality of the body and its
capabilities for action in the world. This challenges traditional views of cognition as solely internal
information processing. Environmental scaffolding refers to the idea that the environment plays a
crucial role in shaping and supporting cognitive processes. This includes all; natural, built, digital,
social, cultural, political, and relational environments where the organism is situated. These
environments can be actively used to configure and regulate specific cognitive abilities. Finally,
Enaction argues that cognition arises through active engagement and interaction between the
organism and its ecological niche. It suggests that cognitive processes are not isolated within the brain
but are dynamically shaped by the organism's body and environment. Under the premise of the 3E-
Perspective of cognition, the understanding of cognition as an emergent phenomenon from
the interaction of the different aspects of the organism finds a conceptualization that allows
its practical implementation (Grasso-Cladera et al. 2023). This perspective emphasizes the
participatory nature of cognition, where the organism actively explores and interprets its
surroundings.
European Journal of Neuroscience Page 14 of 89
Parada et al., A 3E Perspective on Neurodiversity
components of the 4E and 3E approaches to the understanding of cognition, respectively. The Embodied (i.e., the
recognition of the integral role of the organism in cognitive processes and the inseparable connection between the body
and cognitive activities) and Enactive (i.e., the active engagement of individuals with their surroundings, viewing
cognition as an ongoing, co-constructed process between the organism and its environment) components present
continuity between the 4E - 3E cognition shifting. The notions of Embeddedness (i.e., the significant influence of the agent’s
environment in cognitive processes) and Extendedness (i.e., the possibility of extending cognitive processes beyond the
boundaries of the individual’s body), which are considered separately in the 4E Perspective, are combined in the
Environmentally Scaffolded concept (i.e., the emphasis of supportive structures and resources provided by the
environment, as a provider of cognitive scaffolding that shapes and facilitated cognitive processes), offering a more
precise and practical understanding of the relation of the ecological niche sphere of cognition.
The 3E principles are in line with the concept of epistemic justice, which implies the
just and equal treatment of people in the domaini of knowledge and information. The
concept encapsulates the idea that everyone has the same chances to engage in the exchange
of knowledge, sees their viewpoints acknowledged anwd appreciated, and does not face
unjust biases or discrimination that impedes their capacity to contribute to or gain from the
sharing of knowledge (Fricker 2007). This neurodiversity-affirmative7 approach sees
neurodiversity as i) a natural physiological variation in how the brain and body system
operates, showcasing unique strengths and challenges rather than deficits; ii) a way of being
that does not require correction, but tailored support to individual needs without enforcing
conformity to standard norms; iii) particular neurobiological makeups, inviting
individuals to gain insights into their needs, developing strategies that suits them,
Or simply, neuro-affirmative framework

advocating for their rights to self-representation and decision-making regarding their lives;
and iv) a systemic issue that also goes beyond personal factors, seeking to reform spaces like
schools, workplaces, and communities to be more welcoming, mitigating obstacles and
barriers for people with neurodiverse traits (Pellicano and den Houting 2022; Fricker 2007).
Considering the articulation with epistemic justice and neuro-affirmative approaches, we
will now proceed to provide a more detailed description of each one of the 3E principles.
Flesh and Thought Intertwined: Cognition Unfolds within Organisms
The emphasis on the Embodiment principle is one of the elements of continuity in the
4E to 3E Cognition shift. Both perspectives highlight the fact that our cognitive processes are
deeply rooted in the very physiology of our bodies as autonomous organisms. As Varela and
colleagues (1991) argued, this mePans that the body, along with all its (neuro)physiological states
arising from interactions with the world (i.e., natural, built, digital, social, cultural, political,
relational), is mechanically and constitutively linked to our experience (Parada and Rossi 2020). In
simpler terms, all our cognitive processes, from thinking and reasoning to memory, are influenced
by our physicality and the possibilities it affords for action (Djebbara et al. 2022; Purdon et al. 2013).
This implies that systems like visceral, sensory, and motor aspects are not mere outputs of cognitive
processing, but rather play a central role in both its development and function.
This emphasis on embodiment challenges traditional, computational views of cognition that
suggest it is primarily an abstract information processing activity (Adams and Aizawa 2009;
Gallagher 2023). Recognizing that our physiology forms the very foundation of our experience
(Purdon et al. 2013), cognitive research should therefore always include measures that capture both
the mental and the physical, such as psychophysiological and neurobehavioral data (Azzalini, Rebollo,
and Tallon-Baudry 2019). Following the premise of embodiment, research has investigated the
bidirectional relationship between the brain and the organism's physiology by examining
the interactions among different systems. The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) has been
pivotal in understanding how various physiological activities influence the brain (L. A.
Shapiro 2014; Foglia and Wilson 2013; M. Wilson 2002; A. Wilson and Golonka 2013). For instance,
European Journal of Neuroscience Page 16 of 89
Parada et al., A 3E Perspective on Neurodiversity
Electrodermal Activity (EDA) serves as a measure of emotional regulation and stress
(Caruelle, Gustafsson, and Shams 2019; Greco et al. 2021), while Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is
utilized as a physiological marker for stress, emotion regulation, and cognitive processes
(Thayer et al. 2012; Laborde, Mosley, and Thayer 2017; Azzalini, Rebollo, and Tallon-Baudry 2019).
At the same time, different pathways, primarily afferent routes, have been explored to
understand the embodied dynamics associated with cognition. These include the gut-brain
axis (Azzalini, Rebollo, and Tallon-Baudry 2019; Breit et al. 2018; Rebollo, Wolpert, and Tallon-
Baudry 2021; Dinan and Cryan 2017; Sarkar et al. 2018; Palacios-García et al. 2022) and the heart-
brain axis (McCraty et al. 2009; Tahsili-Fahadan and Geocadin 2017; McCraty 2019).
Shaping Minds by Shaping Worrlds: The Power of Environmental Scaffolding
Environmental Scaffolding, Pa novel principle within the 3E perspective, bridges the gap
between Extendedness and Embeddedness. It encompasses all environments an organism interacts with,
including the natural, built, digital, social, cultural, political, and relational domains. These
environments essentially form the organism's niche, a dynamic and interconnected space where
various modalities and dimensions intersect and influence each other (Phoenix and Pattynama 2006).
Environmental scaffolding allows us to leverage and configure environmental factors to shape,
facilitate, or regulate specific activities or abilities (Coninx and Stephan 2021; Varga 2019; Sutton et
al. 2010; Shvarts and Bakker 2019). The 3E perspective emphasizes that we don't need to determine
whether the skill or capacity facilitated by the environmental scaffold is actively implemented by the
agent, passively serves as a backdrop, or has a causal link to the environment. The key takeaway is
that cognition is inherently situated and relational, and reducing it to a single dimension is reductive.
Furthermore, environmental scaffolding emphasizes the bi-directional interaction between the
organism and its environment. This means that agents actively shape their environments, adapting
to their niche while simultaneously shaping it through their actions and interactions (Sterelny 2010;
Gibson 1979; F. Varela, Thompson, and Rosch 1991; Lewontin 1983; Odling-Smee 1988). Evidence
supporting the environmental scaffolding principle can be found in different fields. For
example, in education, the concept of the environment as the “third teacher” (e.g., Tarr 2014)
Page 17 of 89 European Journal of Neuroscience
Parada et al., A 3E Perspective on Neurodiversity
indicates how the design and conceptualization of spaces can encourage, obstruct, or
support interactions in early childhood. A concrete example is the Reggio Emilia approach
to education (Moss 2016), where the use of environmental cues (i.e., “provocators”) triggers
curiosity, exploratory behavior, and discussion among children (Robson and Mastrangelo
2018; Mäkelä, Kankaanranta, and Helfenstein 2014). Another concrete example of
environmental scaffolding is the design of interactive installations in public parks -such as
sensor-activated water fountains or musical playgrounds- that facilitate physical activity
and strengthens community bonds by bringing people together in playful and cooperative
environments (Masullo et al. 2021; Rubegni, Memarovic, and Langheinrich 2011; Van Renswouw,
Vos, and Van Wesemael 2021). Certainly, more empirical research is needed, and that is one of
the main reasons the neuroscience community must embrace the complexity and
hypotheses that concepts such as environmental scaffolding afford. Recent work by the
neuroergonomics (Wascher et al. 2023) or the spatial navigation (Coutrot et al. 2018)
communities, where spatial features and socio-contextual factors are being used to better
explain specific cognitive abilities. Nevertheless, educational or urbanistic approaches
embracing complexity are yet in need of stronger evidence.
Therefore, within environmental scaffolding, the active modification of certain aspects of the
agent’s relationship with the environment (Odling-Smee, Laland, and & Feldman 2003; Bertolotti
and Magnani 2017; Colombetti and Krueger 2015; Laland, Matthews, and Feldman 2016),
underscores the crucial point that cognitive research should always consider environmental features
as significant influences on cognition (Djebbara et al. 2022; Charalambous and Djebbara 2023).
Enaction: Bridging the Gap Between Organism and Environment in the 3E Perspective
Similar to Embodiment, the Enaction principle remains when shifting from the 4E to
the 3E perspective. Enaction stands as the final and integral principle of the 3E perspective, merging
the organism with its surrounding ecological niche. Enaction builds upon the foundation laid by the
Embodiment principle, which states that the body, along with all its neurophysiological states
influenced by the natural, built, digital, social, cultural, political, or relational environments, are
European Journal of Neuroscience Page 18 of 89
Parada et al., A 3E Perspective on Neurodiversity
intricately tied to the organism's experiential reality (Parada and Rossi 2020). Furthermore, the
Environmental Scaffolding principle asserts that the intersection and interactions of these diverse
environmental aspects play a pivotal role in shaping, facilitating, and guiding specific activities or
capacities (Grasso-Cladera et al. 2023). Thus, the Enactive approach not only links but also coherently
articulates the relationship between an organism and its ecological niche. This means that cognition
is seen as a phenomenon not restricted to the brain's intrinsic areas but as a process deeply
intertwined with the body and the environment through active engagement and interaction.
Echoing the thoughts of Varela, Di Paolo, Gallagher, and others (1991; 2017; 2023), cognition
is understood not as a mere product of internal brain computations or representations but as a result
of the organism's dynamic interaction with its environment. This perspective emphasizes that the
psychophysiological and neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying cognition are actively shaped by
the organism's exploration and interaction with its world. This ongoing engagement implies a
process of participatory sense-making, where the organism's historical context, needs, and goals play
a crucial role in interpreting and assigning meaning to its ecological niche (De Jaegher and Di Paolo
2007). Consequently, research in cognition should aim for a balanced approach that incorporates
both laboratory studies and real-world experimental settings (Makeig et al. 2009; Parada 2018; Stangl,
Maoz, and Suthana 2023; Gramann et al. 2014).
Thus, the 3E-Cognition principles provide a robust and holistic framework for
understanding the complexities of human cognition. It acknowledges the significant roles of the body
and environment in cognitive processes, thereby offering a more inclusive approach to studying,
understanding, and supporting neurodiversity. This perspective not only enriches theoretical
understanding but also holds the potential for practical applications in creating more inclusive and
supportive environments for neurodiverse individuals across various domains. In the next section,
we will explore the application of the 3E-Cognition model in crafting inclusive environments across
various sectors. For the sake of space, we will only focus on educational settings, workplaces, and
healthcare facilities. The following section will also address the practical challenges associated with
implementing the 3E-Cognition framework, such as the need for technological advancements and
empirical research that effectively captures and responds to the complexities of real-world scenarios.
Page 19 of 89 European Journal of Neuroscience
Parada et al., A 3E Perspective on Neurodiversity
Evidence supporting the Enactive approach is still scarce as neuroscientists need to
further engage in these types of research programmes. Nevertheless, evidence can be found
in fields such as Education and Neurorehabilitation. Within Education, interactive
learning strategies have shown enhanced teaching and learning processes (Abykanova et al.
2016). Even when different strategies are implemented (e.g., active non-flipped classroom
compared against active flipped classroom), the benefits observed in both classroom types
likely stem from engaging teaching methods rather than the sequence of instructor
involvement (Jensen, Kummer, and d M Godoy 2015). This -according to the Enactive
principle- suggests the key factor in enhancing learning is active engagement, not the
format of the classroom. Another concrete example can be found in the field of
neurorehabilitation of patients with stroke, traumatic brain injury, or cerebral palsy,
where survivors of brain lesions or motor impairments have engaged in virtual reality
(VR) environments designed to simulate daily activities (Ravi, Kumar, and Singhi 2017; de
Araújo et al. 2019; Montalbán and Arrogante 2020). Meta-analyses of studies indicate that
neurorehabilitation using virtual reality can enhance physical function in lesion survivors.
The effectiveness of VR is influenced not only by technological aspects but also by its ability
to simulate real-life activities in a controlled, adaptable environment. This allows patients
to practice and regain movements in a manner that closely mirrors their daily routines
(Voinescu, Sui, and Stanton Fraser 2021). Thus, VR facilitates the enactment of daily physical
movements and activities, promoting recovery through active engagement and adaptation.
Fostering Inclusive Environments through the 3E-Cognition
Perspective
The 3E-Cognition perspective -grounded in the understanding that cognitive processes are
deeply intertwined with the body, the environment, and active engagement- can revolutionize the
European Journal of Neuroscience Page 20 of 89
Parada et al., A 3E Perspective on Neurodiversity
way different settings and systems are designed and implemented. These philosophical principles for
understanding cognition, can truly become design principles.
Learning Unbound: The 3E Framework for Inclusive and Effective Education
During childhood and adolescence, school becomes an important environment in which all
kinds of social interactions take place. As a natural environment replication, schools should be the
place in which social encounters can occur among individuals with different cultural backgrounds,
racial and sociocultural origins, religious beliefs, learning abilities, etc. However -historically- formal
education has tended to standardize and homogenize students, molding them to fit predetermined
expectations in terms of characteristics, outcomes, behavior, and responses to teaching methods
(Johnson and Majewska 2022). In this context, certain marginalized groups, including individuals
with disabilities, ethnic and linguistic minorities -as well as girls and women- were at a heightened
risk of being excluded from the educateional space (Blanco 2004). Educational inclusion aims to
overcome this conventional approach by transcending mere access to traditional schools for
traditionally marginalized student groups. It involves a transformation of the educational system to
recognize and address the diverse learning needs of every student. The core of an inclusion
perspective in education lies in fostering an inclusive environment that goes beyond merely
eliminating barriers. It involves an active promotion of a seamless integration and participation of
all students, regardless of their backgrounds (Johnson and Majewska 2022). Adopting the 3E-
Cognition perspective can lead to a radical transformation on how education is implemented, making
it more inclusive and effective for students with neurophysiological and neuro-morphological
diversity.
Page 21 of 89 European Journal of Neuroscience
Parada et al., A 3E Perspective on Neurodiversity
Formal traditional educational settings are an unbalanced mixture of late-1800’s
infrastructure8, late-1900’s power relationships9, and some wide-ranging technology10, all blended in
a bizarre, non-intended manner! Environmentally-scaffolded learning spaces imply that schools and
other educational environments have to be designed based on robust evidence (e.g., systematic
reviews) in order to cater to a variety of neurodiverse needs, incorporating elements like sensory-
friendly zones or technology-assisted learning for students who benefit from these adaptations.
Research on the future architectural and design principles for educational environments is still much
needed (Young and Cleveland 2022). In fact, there is evidence on how the characteristics of the
infrastructure, furniture and layout of the space impact the quality of education, since they affect the
construction of learning, motivation and inclusion of students, therefore, modeling of the physical
environment of learning is essential, since it is a third educator (Barrett et al. 2017; Ferguson et al.
2013; Lewinski 2015; Li and Sullivan 2016; Manns, Adlerstein, and González 2016; O’Donnell
8 Educational built spaces are typically rigid,r imposing structures that resemble incarceration or hospitalization
environments. This situation is very common in the global south. Furniture design is outdated, often assuming
passiveness in learning. Classrooms are often composed ofR rigid layouts with rows of desks pointing towards the educator,
and limited access to technology that hamper active learning and collaboration. Economic disparities limit investment in
educational infrastructure and resources, perpetuating the cycle of disadvantage for neurodiverse individuals and
completely ignoring any special needs. Furthermore, conflict-affected areas (e.g., the Yemen and Ukraine wars; the
Nagorno Karabakh, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Great Lakes conflicts; the Haiti, Iran, Pakistan,
Sahel crises; and the Gaza genocide, to name a few) often struggle to proevide even basic education, with schools destroyed
or repurposed. Furthermore, the increasing conservative and fascist global resurgence means retrograde cultural values
at all levels, implying resistance to new pedagogical approaches and/or a lack of awareness about their benefits.
The traditional "sage on the stage" model, where teachers hold all the knowledge and students passively receive
it, still prevails in many classrooms (McWilliam 2009). This implies that students have little-to-nothing to say in
curriculum design, learning activities, or classroom rules, reinforcing and perpetuating hierarchical structures.
Unfortunately, corporal punishment or harsh sanctions for disobedience in the classroom is present worldwide: in the
USA, school corporal punishment is currently legal in 19 states leading to over 160,000 children to be subjected to corporal
punishment in schools each year (Dietz 2000; Sultana, Reza, and Bromfield 2019; Sanapo and Nakamura 2011; Humble
2013; Gershoff and Font 2016).
Interestingly, a wide range of technologies are being integrated in worldwide classrooms, fueled -in part- by
the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Haleem et al. 2022; Han and Sa 2022; Chandra et al. 2022). Highly dependent on
economic status of the educational communities’ actors, range from interactive projectors to smartboards and chalk
blackboards, and from virtual reality to online platforms and low-resolution paper photocopies; these technologies have
evidenced significant structural gaps and inequalities: in digital access and usage; urban-rural; educator skills; language
barriers; and gender, to name a few (Brussevich, Dabla-Norris, and Khalid 2019; Lembani et al. 2020; Elena-Bucea et al.
2021). More recently, artificial intelligence applications such as OpenAI’s chatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, or Google’s
Gemini are being used in supervised and unsupervised manners worldwide, presenting relevant opportunities and
challenges to education (Rasul et al. 2023).
European Journal of Neuroscience Page 22 of 89
Parada et al., A 3E Perspective on Neurodiversity
Wicklund Pigozzi and Peterson, Architects Inc, VS Furniture, and Bruce Mau Design 2010; Mehta,
Shortz, and Benden 2015; Piderit-Moreno et al. 2023; Naïr 2016). Physical space will furthermore
provide a range of materials that appeal to the different perceptual and learning capacities, such as
visual aids, auditory tools, and hands-on materials. All of these can support the diversity
encountered in modern educational settings, providing the physical space to recognize and
accommodate the unique learning needs of neurodiverse students through individualized
teaching methods and support systems (R. Martin and Wilkins 2022; C. S. Martin 2016). For
example, Susquehanna University's library transformed its space for neurodiverse students
by adding fidget toys, occupancy counters, and sensory-friendly study rooms (Boyer and El-
Chidiac 2023). Such reorganizations increase engagement among both students and teachers,
enhance attentiveness, and promote interactive behaviors (Nordquist, Twardosz, and
McEVOY 1991; Kokko and Hirsto 2021; Boyer and El-Chidiac 2023). Similarly, environmental
changes in the classroom regarding sound (i.e., installation of sound absorbing walls) and
luminosity (i.e., incorporation of halogen light) had a positive impact on attention and
engagement of students with autism or dyspraxia (Kinnealey et al. 2012). For example,
improving acoustic quality significantly impacted autistic students, further highlighting
the need for improved design and material specifications and/or reorganizing classroom
environments (Lekan-Kehinde, Asojo, and Sanborn 2023).
Another relevant aspect of traditional educational models is the prioritizing of disciplines
with direct impacts on economic growth, often sidelining arts, humanities, and social sciences. STEM
(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) educational models perfectly reflect this
tendency (Videla, Aguayo, and Veloz 2021). The 3E-Cognition perspective challenges this
reductionist view on societal growth by emphasizing the holistic development of students. It
advocates for an integrated approach that values the arts and humanities as crucial components in
fostering meaningful education; where self-awareness, empathy, and interpersonal skills,
questioning, and exploration are encouraged. In contrast, STEAM education appears as a stronger
model, where students engage in physical activities such as art creation, dance, and/or drama, linking
Page 23 of 89 European Journal of Neuroscience
Parada et al., A 3E Perspective on Neurodiversity
cognitive processes with bodily experiences (Videla, Aguayo, and Veloz 2021). Additionally, the
sensory benefits of engaging in the arts cannot be overstated. Activities such as painting,
sculpting, and music stimulate multiple senses, enhancing sensory integration and motor
skills (King and Parada 2021; Wan and Schlaug 2010; Schneider et al. 2007; Zatorre, Chen, and
Penhune 2007). Creativity and expression through the arts allow students to explore and
communicate their emotions, fostering self-awareness and empathy (Tsatsou-Nikolouli and
Mavrogeni 2021; Corral, Maier, and Argus-Calvo 2023; Jin and Ye 2022). For instance, in a recent
randomized control trial, special needs students went through a weekly 10-week structured
group art therapy program. Results show the efficacy of art therapy in an educational
context for improving social-emotional competencies in this group of students with neuro-
psycho-motor deficiencies (Lavric and Soponaru 2023).
Furthermore, meaningful learning can happen through activities that connect cultural
heritage, local historical events, or narratives to physical experiences, such as reenactments or
interactive storytelling. In this sense, the approach of funds of knowledge and identity in education
can contribute to valuing and including in teaching practices and school curriculum family and
community knowledge and experiences that students bring from contexts outside of school and that
support the strengthening of their identities (Moises Esteban-Guitart et al. 2022; Muñoz et al. 2022).
Hence, using the funds of knowledge approach has significantly impacted fostering
students' reflection, appreciation, and reinterpretation of their families and communities
(Castillo, Cardenas, and Lastra 2023), as well as shaping prejudices and stereotypes (Templeton
2013). Likewise, active and experiential learning, such as project-based learning where students
actively participate in social surveys or community projects, field trips, role-playing, and simulations
allow students to actively engage with the material, making learning more dynamic and meaningful.
Such practices will directly lead to interdisciplinary learning, where learners are encouraged to
explore connections between arts, humanities, and social sciences fostering a culture of curiosity and
broadening their understanding of complex concepts. The natural immersion in complexity will
promote diverse ranges of critical thinking and analytical skills, encouraging students to question,
analyze, and synthesize information from various sources, developing their multiliteracies (Báez-
European Journal of Neuroscience Page 24 of 89
Parada et al., A 3E Perspective on Neurodiversity
Bargellini and Meneses-Arévalo 2023; Kalantzis, Cope, and Zapata 2020; Zhang et al. 2019). In this
sense, the promotion of multiliteracies has shown potential for the development of critical
thinking, the integration of technologies, the inclusion of those who are more
disadvantaged, and even for increasing the students’ engagement in their learning processes,
among other benefits (Kesler, Tinio, and Nolan 2016; Kohnen and Lacy 2018; Reyes-Torres and
Raga 2020; Zammit 2011). Hence, each learner’s background and neurophysiological/morphological
makeup will provide a unique richness to each class project, where each learner is the zone of
proximal development (Lee 2012). Curiosity will finally emerge as a driving force in education (Zurn
and Shankar 2020).
Thus, the 3E-Cognition perspective can enhance creativity, critical thinking, and emotional
intelligence, which are essential skills in today's complex world. In a 3E-Cognition educational
setting, students are not just passive recipients of information but active participants in their learning
journey. This approach cultivates a sense of wonder and active inquiry, encouraging students to
engage with their learning environment in a more meaningful and personalized way, and agency
development (Vaughn et al. 2020). As with inclusive education, in the 3E-Cognition educational
setting, neurodiversity is no longer an issue, but an asset. Inclusive education is not merely an
ambition exclusive to a specific school population facing (dis)ability or various learning difficulties.
It is a perspective aimed at transforming educational systems so that all students, without restrictions
or limitations, have comparable and quality opportunities for the full development of their
personalities (Ainscow 2020; Sarrionandia 2017). The above will allow us to overcome the deficit
approach and value the diversity of practices and ways of feeling, thinking and learning of students
(Lillis 2019; Sito and Moreno Mosquera 2021).
Taking all of these together, we can envision a middle school whose classrooms are
designed with movable furniture and sensory-friendly zones (e.g., adjustable lighting to
reduce sensory overload). This would allow teachers to reconfigure the space for various
activities, from group work to individual study, accommodating different individual styles
and sensory needs. The curriculum is based on active learning and STEAM (Science,
Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) education, emphasizing the arts alongside
Page 25 of 89 European Journal of Neuroscience
Parada et al., A 3E Perspective on Neurodiversity
traditional STEM subjects to foster technical, scientific and humanistic development.
Activities such as painting, sculpting, and music, stimulating multiple senses and enhancing
motor skills (Videla, Aguayo, and Veloz 2021; King and Parada 2021) are hands-on projects that
connect learning to real-world experiences and their cultural backgrounds (Moisès Esteban-
Guitart and Moll 2014).
Beyond Accommodation, Embracing Potential: 3E-Cognition for Neurodiverse Teams
Embracing the 3E-Cognition principles can be a game-changer for both neurodiverse
employees and the organizations they work for. This framework emphasizes understanding and
supporting the unique cognoitive, physical, and sensory experiences of individuals in the workplace.
This isn't just about doing the right thing for individuals; it's about unlocking the immense talent
and diverse perspectives that neurodiversity can bring to any team. Research by de Beer, Scott, and
others (2022; 2019) highlights how the work environment, including both physical and social aspects,
plays a critical role in enabling neurodiverse individuals to thrive. Their ability to find and maintain
meaningful employment hinges on it. This is wRhere 3E-Cognition design principles come in. By
applying them, we can effectively bridge the gap between individuals and their surroundings. We
can break down barriers and build up facilitators, ultimateily leading to improved employability rates
and job satisfaction for neurodiverse people. Specifically, the Environmental Scaffolding principle can
guide the efficient and evidence-based design of workspaces that are adaptable to diverse neurological
and neurophysiological needs.
Designing physical environments that are not only functional but also supportive of various
cognitive styles and preferences, promoting mental health in the work environment, as well
as performance and an increase in job retention (Kropman et al. 2023). A systematic review
conducted by Weber and colleagues (2022) indicates that environmental accommodations
can lower sensorial stress levels generated by noise and visual stimulation. Economic
changes such as earplugs and/or noise-canceling headphones make a significant difference.
Likewise, flexible lighting options exemplify environmental adaptations by allowing
European Journal of Neuroscience Page 26 of 89
Parada et al., A 3E Perspective on Neurodiversity
employees to tailor their lighting conditions to individual sensory preferences, enhancing
comfort and productivity. Studies have shown that neurodiverse individuals often have
heightened sensory sensitivities, making traditional lighting setups potentially distracting
or discomforting. Adjustable lighting systems, including dimmable lights and a choice
between different light temperatures (e.g., warm, cool, or natural daylight), enable
employees to create a workspace that minimizes sensory stress and maximizes focus (Joines
et al. 2015). Furthermore, providing quiet spaces can help neurodiverse employees to escape
the -sometimes chaotic- ambience of open-plan offices to concentrate or manage sensory
overload, as well as lowering stimulation overload and social requirement (Petty et al. 2023).
Adapting the environment to individuals inhabiting and using those spaces can also have a
cumulative beneficial impact on other aspects of work, as it can decrease sensory processing demands
for employees. For example, by reducing the distraction, discomfort and/or stress generated by some
elements of the environment, such as flickering lights or noises. Moreover, inclusive organizations
can scaffold their employees’ abilities, disabilities, and styles using inclusive communication tools,
such as visual aids, written instructions, mobile applications, artificial intelligence-based assistants,
and text-to-speech software (Coplan, Crocker, and Landin 2021). By creating an environment that is
responsive to the needs of all employees, organizations can foster a culture of inclusivity and diversity
that promotes wellbeing. Furthermore, growing evidence indicates that wellbeing in the workplace
is conducive to productivity and efficiency (Amy Isham, Mair, and Jackson 2021; A. Isham, Mair, and
Jackson 2019; Papagiannidis and Marikyan 2020).
Beyond the physical/structural scaffolding, the Enaction principle means providing
opportunities for all employees to actively participate and contribute their unique perspectives and
skills. This is particularly important for neurodiverse employees, who may be creative and may have
unconventional -yet valuable- approaches to problem-solving. Hence, offering tailored support for
neurodiverse individuals to excel in their roles, such as assistive technologies, mentorship
programs, and customized training sessions can have a relevant impact on innovation and efficiency
(Honeybourne 2019). For example, organizations can invest in research to develop specific software
Page 27 of 89 European Journal of Neuroscience
Parada et al., A 3E Perspective on Neurodiversity
applications that can aid in organizing tasks or goals; or can adapt flexible schedules for certain
workers, significantly improving the work experience for neurodivergent individuals.
Organizations can also leverage the unique strengths and talents of neurodiverse individuals
by creating roles or projects that align with their specific skills and interests. This not only maximizes
their potential but also contributes to innovation and growth within companies. Evidence shows that
work-related strengths of neurodiverse and neurotypical individuals can be combined in
work teams, improving the overall performance of the group (Austin and Pisano 2017;
Hendricks 2010; Tomczak and Kulikowski 2023). For example, monotonous and repetitive tasks
might be highly demandant for neurotypical employees, but they can be an asset for
neurodiverse individuals since might promote high concentration for longer periods of
time conducting well-structured and repetitive tasks (Hendricks 2010; Scott et al. 2015). Hence,
embracing neurodiversity in this way can lead to the development of novel solutions and
perspectives, driving forward-thinking and competitive advantage.
Additionally, organizational wellness programs that acknowledge the interplay between
physical health and cognitive functioning are essential. These could include ergonomic workstations
designed to reduce physical strain, stress management programs tailored to individual needs, and
activities that promote physical well-being, such as yoga classes, sensory restriction spaces, and/or
walking meetings. Such initiatives can mitigate work-related stress, which is often a significant
barrier to productivity, particularly for neurodiverse individuals who might experience stress
differently. Thus, applying the 3E-Cognition principles in the workplace is not just about creating a
supportive environment for neurodiverse employees; it's about recognizing the value and potential
that neurodiversity may bring to an organization. By embracing and accommodating the varied
cognitive and sensory experiences of their workforce, companies can foster a culture of inclusivity,
innovation, and diversity. This approach may lead to enhanced employee satisfaction and well-being,
increased productivity, and more dynamic, modern, creative, and adaptable organizations.
Taking all of these together, we can envision a company that -at the global level-
communicates using visual aids, written instructions, uses technology efficiently, and has
implemented AI-based assistants to support diverse communication styles. This allows
European Journal of Neuroscience Page 28 of 89
Parada et al., A 3E Perspective on Neurodiversity
employees -regardless of their cognitive abilities- to access, use, and process information
effectively. At the local level, each workstation is equipped with dimmable lights and
adjustable color temperatures, adjustable desks and ergonomic chairs, ensuring physical
comfort and reducing strain. Furthermore, similar to smoking rooms at airports, there are
several soundproof quiet rooms as well as incorporating activities such as walking
meetings. Also, new employees receive tailored training sessions and mentorship programs
-with experienced mentors- supporting diverse employees in developing their skills and
confidence, as well as providing guidance and support, enhancing their professional and
personal growth.
From Deficit to Diversity: How the 3E Perspective Can Revolutionize Neurodiversity
Healthcare
Healthcare systems and providers stand at a pivotal point where the adoption of the 3E
perspective could significantly enhance the support and care for neurodiverse individuals.
However, adopting the 3E principles implies a paradigm shift in how healthcare professionals
perceive and interact with cognitive phenomena in general and neurodiversity in particular.
Traditionally, the medical model has often viewed neurodiversity through a deficit lens, focusing
primarily on the challenges or impairments associated with these conditions. The 3E perspective,
however, advocates for a more holistic and inclusive approach, recognizing the rich tapestry of
experiences, abilities, and needs that characterize neurodiverse individuals.
Training healthcare providers in this ethico-onto-epistemology is a critical step towards
achieving this goal. The 3E perspective goes beyond mere understanding of clinical symptoms and
treatment protocols; it involves empathizing with the patient's lived experience, considering their
narratives, and valuing their unique perspective (de Haan 2020). Indeed, expressive and
autobiographical writing has been shown to have therapeutic properties and contribute to the
personal development of individuals, the processing of their life experiences and the improvement
of their health (Jean Clandinin 2006; Pennebaker 2018; Pennebaker and Smyth 2016; Moisès Esteban-

Guitart and Moll 2014). This training would equip healthcare professionals with the skills to see
beyond the conventional diagnostic categories and appreciate the individuality of each neurodiverse
patient. Such a perspective is not only more respectful but also more effective, as it leads to a deeper
understanding of the patient's condition, resulting in more accurate diagnoses and more personalized
treatment plans. Personalized treatment plans -crafted with an understanding of the patient's unique
context- are essential in catering to the specific needs of neurodiverse individuals and realistic,
meaningful possibilities for scaffolding. These plans would consider not only the medical or
behavioral aspects of neurodiversity but also the social, emotional, and environmental factors that
affect the individual's well-being. For example, sensory sensitivities -which are common in autistic
individuals- might be overlooked in a standard treatment approach but are crucial for their comfort
and well-being (Morgan 2019). Recognizing and accommodating such needs can drastically improve
the healthcare experience for neurodiverse patients.
Furthermore, improved patient-provider communication is another significant benefit of the
3E perspective. Effective communication is foundational to quality healthcare (de Haan 2020), and
this is especially true for neurodiverse individuals, who may have unique ways of processing
information and expressing themselves. Healthcare providers trained in the 3E-Cognition
perspective would be better equipped to adapt their communication style to meet the needs of their
neurodiverse patients, fostering a more inclusive and supportive healthcare environment. This could
involve the use of visual aids, simplified language, or allowing more time for patient responses,
among other strategies. Moreover, advocating for patient-centered care, where the voices of
neurodiverse individuals are not just heard but actively integrated into decision-making (De
Jaegher 2023), is a crucial aspect of supporting ethical and epistemological integrity in healthcare.
This involves respecting the autonomy of neurodiverse individuals and acknowledging their right
to be active participants in their healthcare (Milton and Moon 2012). It also means involving them
in discussions about their treatment options, considering their preferences and concerns, and
working collaboratively to develop care plans that align with their values and life goals.
Taking all of these together, we can envision a healthcare clinic that is designed with
sensory sensitivities in mind. Waiting areas and consultation rooms are equipped with

adjustable lighting, soundproofing, and calming décor to create a comfortable environment
for patients. Among the services that are offered, expressive and autobiographical writing
therapies are a part of its mental health services. Patients are encouraged to express their
experiences (via writing or any other media of their preference), improving emotional
regulation and self-awareness; directly impacting their health processes. Likewise,
healthcare providers are trained to use inclusive communication strategies (e.g., visual aids,
simplified language) and allowing extra time for patient responses. This ensures that
patients can express their needs and preferences effectively. Treatment plans are developed
with a comprehensive understanding of each patient’s unique context, considering medical,
social, emotional, and environmental factors (e.g., an ADHD patient receives a personalized
care plan including behavioral therapy, environmental adjustments at home and work, and
regular follow-ups to monitor progress and adjust the plan as needed).
Discussion
The 3E-Cognition perspective offers an approach to understanding and supporting
neurodiversity, fundamentally differing from traditional models. Unlike conventional
deficit-focused frameworks, the 3E perspective recognizes the rich tapestry of experiences,
abilities, and contexts that shape cognitive phenomena. The 3E-Cognition perspective criticizes
the objectivist and individualistic theories in traditional neurobehavioral research that informs
neurodiversity theories. These often start from a detached view of the human psyche and social
world. These theories, exemplified by the well-known Theory of Mind (Baron-Cohen 2000), tend to
view neurodiverse individuals primarily in terms of deficits, especially in social interactions. Such
an approach is seen as limited because it overlooks the lived experiences and social engagement of
neurodiverse individuals. It is often suggested that teaching social interaction 'rules' to neurodiverse
individuals does not necessarily lead to improved social fluency, as these rules can overlook the
complexity and lived experience of social interactions (Koenig et al. 2009). Moreover, evidence has
shown that the attempts to camouflage, mask or conceal certain personality characteristics related to

a neurodevelopmental condition are associated with worse mental health outcomes (Cook et al.
2021). Specifically, in the case of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), these efforts to 'cover' certain
autistic features involve a significant cognitive effort, which can lead to heightened stress responses
and diminished mental well-being (Cook et al. 2021). In addition, it can negatively impact self-identity
development (Hull et al. 2017, 2019; Costa-Cordella et al. 2023). This evidence reveals that a limited
perspective to consider individuals in terms of exclusive and hierarchical categories (abilities and
disabilities, typical and atypical) is not capable of responding with equity to neurodiversity
(Sarrionandia 2017). In this context, the 3E perspective criticizes traditional models of cognition for
precluding researchers from recognizing and appreciating the engagement of neurodiverse
individuals as social capacities cannot be captured by abstract rules but are grounded in lived social
experiences (e.g., physical and sensory experiences; contextual and environmental factors; and
interactions and tools that extend cognitive processes). Finally, because cognitive phenomena are
shaped by the organism’s history and environment, the 3E perspective acknowledges how each
individual experiences and interacts with the world. A key concept of the Enactive approach -
participatory sense-making11- is a concrete strategy to counter the homogenizing tendencies of
traditional approaches to cognition (De Jaegher and Di Paolo 2007), encouraging us to value the
diverse ways both neurotypical and neurodiverse individuals engage with their surroundings. This
is, the importance of recognizing and valuing the diverse lived experiences, participatory
interactions, and context-dependent ways both neurotypical and neurodiverse individuals engage
with their environment and with others.
Thus, the 3E-Cognition perspective on Neurodiversity offers a profound and transformative
framework for understanding and supporting neurodiverse individuals across various contexts such
as education, workplace, and healthcare. This approach, grounded in recognizing diverse forms of
participation, engaged epistemology, countering deficit-based views, and supporting ethical and
epistemological integrity, provides a comprehensive roadmap for creating more inclusive and
respectful environments for neurodiverse individuals. Nevertheless, human neuroscience still

needs to provide specific paradigms and approaches for applied research. We think that the Mobile
Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) framework is an exciting and innovative avenue for advancing our
understanding and support of neurodiverse individuals in the real world (Makeig et al. 2009; Parada
and Rossi 2020; Stangl, Maoz, and Suthana 2023; Gramann et al. 2021). MoBI is a cutting-edge
framework that combines brain imaging with lightweight neurobehavioral sensors (e.g.,
electroencephalogram (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), eye-tracking,
electrocardiogram (ECG); Grasso-Cladera et al. 2022), allowing for the study of cognitive processes
in mobile and real-world settings. MoBI aligns perfectly with the 3E perspective, as it can be used
from the laboratory to the real world: e.g., inside the classroom (Dikker et al. 2017; Davidesco et al.
2021); in workplaces (Chuang and Ihme 2018; Wascher et al. 2023); as well as with individuals, dyads,
and groups conducting singular or multiple simultaneous recordings (Parada and Rossi 2020).
We have highlighted the recognition of diverse forms of participation as crucial in future
educational settings. By embracing the 3E perspective, educators can move beyond traditional
neurotypical expectations and appreciate the unique ways neurodiverse students learn and
contribute. This involves creating learning environments that acknowledge and adapt to the varied
sensory, cognitive, and social needs of autistic and other neurodiverse students. Furthermore,
educators are encouraged to develop curricula and teaching methods that are inclusive, participatory,
and responsive to the strengths and interests of each student; innovative educational settings, such as
STEAM education appears as a powerful framework to accomplish this (Videla, Aguayo, and Veloz
2021). This shift can help counter the prevalent deficit-based views in education, replacing them with
a focus on the individual strengths and potential of neurodiverse learners. MoBI can be used to
explore how neurodiverse students interact with their learning environments in real-time. By
modeling scalable neurobehavioral dynamics during different educational activities (Parada 2018),
researchers can gain insights into how individuals and groups process information, respond to
sensory stimuli, and engage with their surroundings (Rowland et al. 2019; Janssen et al. 2021; Dikker
et al. 2017). This data can inform the development of more effective, personalized learning strategies
and environments that align with the diverse cognitive and sensory needs of neurodiverse students.
Additionally, integrating MoBI findings with innovative educational settings could provide a holistic

view of how neurodiverse students interact with interdisciplinary learning, thereby enhancing
participatory and inclusive educational practices.
Furthermore, in the context of employment, the 3E perspective can significantly enhance the
integration and participation of neurodiverse individuals. By understanding and valuing different
forms of engagement and communication, employers and coworkers can create a more inclusive and
supportive workplace culture. This perspective urges organizations to implement policies and
practices that acknowledge the unique talents and needs of neurodiverse employees, such as flexible
work arrangements, tailored communication strategies, and supportive social environments (Milton
and Moon 2012). Emphasizing ethical and epistemological integrity, businesses can foster a
workplace where neurodiverse individuals are not only employed but also empowered and valued
for their unique contributions. MoBI can be used to study the dynamic interactions between
neurodiverse employees and their work environments (Ahn et al. 2018; Dumas et al. 2011; I. Clark
and Dumas 2015). Understanding how different workplace settings, such as lighting, noise levels, and
spatial arrangements, impact the cognitive and emotional states of neurodiverse individuals can
lead to the creation of more accommodating and productive workspaces (Doyle 2020; Weber et al.
2022). Employers can use these insights to implement changes that not only enhance the comfort and
efficiency of neurodiverse employees but also foster a more inclusive and innovative workplace
culture. Future research should focus on the effect of reasonable adjustments to the physical work
environment on the sensory and social stress of neurodiverse people.
Finally, healthcare systems and providers can greatly benefit from adopting the 3E perspective
to better support neurodiverse individuals. This entails a shift from viewing neurodiversity through
a deficit lens to recognizing the diverse experiences and needs of neurodiverse individuals.
Healthcare providers trained in 3E-Cognition can offer more empathetic and effective care by
understanding the patient's perspective, leading to more accurate diagnoses, tailored treatment plans,
improved patient-provider communication, and treatment adherence. In this context, supporting
ethical and epistemological integrity means advocating for patient-centered care, where
neurodiverse individuals' voices are heard, respected, and integrated into their care plans. MoBI's
potential to provide a comprehensive view of how neurodiverse individuals experience and

respond to different stimuli and interactions can revolutionize patient-centered care and precision
medicine (Fernandes et al. 2017). For example, by observing how neurodiverse patients'
neurobehavioral dynamics correlate with their bodily responses in various healthcare settings,
researchers can develop more nuanced and effective approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and
communication. This is one of the core tenets of the 3E-Cognition perspective; healthcare practices
that respect and integrate the lived experiences of neurodiverse individuals.
In summary -for healthcare- adopting the 3E perspective means moving towards
patient-centered care that respects and incorporates the lived experiences of neurodiverse
individuals. This involves training healthcare providers to empathize with patients'
narratives and view their conditions through a holistic lens, ultimately leading to more
accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment plans. In educational settings, the 3E-
Cognition perspective advocates for inclusive environments that recognize and
accommodate diverse learning needs. Implementing sensory-friendly spaces and
integrating arts and humanities into the curriculum can enhance students' engagement and
holistic development. Such approaches not only improve academic outcomes but also foster
self-awareness, empathy, and critical thinking skills. In the workplace, the 3E principles
guide the design of adaptable and inclusive environments. Providing flexible lighting
options, quiet spaces, and assistive technologies can significantly improve job satisfaction
and productivity for neurodiverse employees. Moreover, fostering a culture that values
diverse cognitive styles and encourages active participation can lead to innovative
solutions and a more dynamic organizational environment. The application of the 3E
principles not only enhances theoretical understanding but also holds significant practical
implications for creating more inclusive and supportive environments across various
domains.

Concluding Remarks
In the present article we suggest that the 3E-Cognition perspective for the
understanding of neurocognitive processes represents a significant conceptual shift in
understanding the mind. The 3E-Cognition perspective provides a powerful framework for
understanding and supporting neurodiverse individuals across various domains. We have briefly
addressed some aspects of educational settings, workplace, and healthcare. However, this ethico-
onto-epistemology can be potentially applied to any human endeavor. Furthermore, the natural
combination of the 3E perspective and MoBI opens up numerous possibilities for future research.
MoBI is a powerful tool for understanding the complex interplay between the brain, body, and
environment in neurodiversity. By leveraging the insights gained from future MoBI research, we can
move closer to realizing the full pPotential of neurodiverse individuals as integrated members of
society.
By recognizing the unique ways in which neurodiverse individuals participate in society,
emphasizing an engaged and respectful understanding of their experiences, and challenging deficit-
based views, applied human neuroscience can help create more evidence-based, inclusive, and
supportive environments. The 3E-Cognition perspective celebrates the rich tapestry of human
diversity, leading to a more equitable and understanding society.
